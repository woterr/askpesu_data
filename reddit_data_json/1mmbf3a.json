    "Please check placement sheet, has list showing which ones came with 7+ CGPA\nâ””â”€â”€ u mean the last year list? its not updated fully\n    â””â”€â”€ this year's I mean, even then none are fully updated bcoz no one maintained after a certain point. So u cant expect a full list, but atleast u will get a rough idea, if u want exact number contact PESU Placements"
