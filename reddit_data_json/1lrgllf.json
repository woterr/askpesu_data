    "I have raised a query regarding this and got below reply. If u have applied for kcet PES round the details filling page will be shown only after KCET round.  So u need to wait till KCET round completion.",
    "It will be updated soon at starting it will be like this but it will change after few days.",
    "use the pes app, click on 3 bars and then student grievances  it will let you fill in your admission details, picture for ID card etc\n├── https://preview.redd.it/ztax7n0lxvaf1.png?width=880&format=png&auto=webp&s=f89ccd6a38228cdd84cb033280f5eb36247c2900  Do we need to do this for MCA admission too? i paid the seat blocking fee a three weeks ago and this is all the info I got\n└── Its also for MCA course??",
