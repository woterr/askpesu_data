    "[placement 2025 stats(unoffical)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TfR17y3iPGzHFmCfWGwAXBpwCHvbxEK0wOP_Kx8FOG8/edit?gid=582730064#gid=582730064) this is the stat sheet of 2025 batch maintained by students, it is outdated at the moment.   [placement stats official(nirf)](https://pes.edu/naac/doc.html?file=upload/nirf/NIRF_2025_PES_University_Engineering.pdf) this is the stat sheet of 2025 official from college website.  To answer your questions:   1) yes , it is possible to aquire a starting salary of 12lpa  or more in campus.   2) it is not very rare in cse , ppl having gpa 8.5+ and some cse fundamentals knowledge and skills  get these offers quite comfortably.   If you check the placement stat sheets you will see that Tier 1 offers(T1) are all 12 and more than 12 lpa packages and the median (not average) package is 12.5 lakhs(approx).

    "Join the college first lil bro\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Bruh everyone had same excitement before joining clg not only him\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Fr ik it's gonna sound corny .... But it feels like a new start\nâ”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ Make sure you have a good journey not only good start\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ It is a new start just make sure you don't make the same mistakes from school. I'm pretty sure you will miss school as well.\nâ”‚           â””â”€â”€ Ye let's hope for the best\nâ””â”€â”€ Damn can't even ask for advice\n    â”œâ”€â”€ You're asking placement advice even before getting a seat here. Ironic no?\n    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Well I will decide using that info if I want a seat here or not\n    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ You asked for steps to get such placements. I doubt that is relevant to choosing a seat here. The rest of your post is fine.\n    â”‚           â””â”€â”€ Well I would like to if I don't take a seat here  What would be the steps would be to get placed .   Steps like avg cgpa needed. Or if there is a zero attendance criteria or something like that . Are there internships companies that prefer a higher cgpa uk the usual one would need to know before taking a life altering decision\n    â”‚               â””â”€â”€ Cool cool. I believe most of it is covered in the placement sheets.\n    â”‚                   â””â”€â”€ Ye thanks  to everyone here all my doubts are cleared (sry if I came off as rude\n    â””â”€â”€ Worry about the subjects, skills, project building, CGPA, scholarships....internships.....then worry about job....come on dude....I understand you come with some big expectations....they all will break ones you step in....worry about the above things...placement will take care of itself...eventually....\n        â””â”€â”€ Yes brother you are right   But I need this data so I can tell/convince my parents   But no worries I got it now",
    "Is it hard for ece student to get 12 lpa job, like how often ece students get 10-12 or even atleast a 8 lpa job.\nâ””â”€â”€ It is hard but I know someone who's gotten it. Requires luck,networks and skills. PESU ain't known for it's ece program so it may be hard to get such an offer on campus unless you're applying for a software related job or something but like I said I know someone who has done it but it was off campus. If you're joining ece,doing a masters will probably give you an edge for core jobs."
