    "Didn't yall already fill preferences online?   Well for pessat last year, offline was the only option afaik.\nâ””â”€â”€ we did but the website says that counselling for admission thru mains and kcet is offline only, which is a bit of a hassle. but canâ€™t do anything else i guess.  https://preview.redd.it/izbrl5gwgk2f1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=66f4301421cd8385bb8664ee22cfbb51fdea1721\n    â””â”€â”€ If they say its offline it is offline.   I have a friend who came all the way from Jammu for thisðŸ’€.   Ig they asked for preferences just to collect data.   It is kinda nice tho ngl.   atb."
