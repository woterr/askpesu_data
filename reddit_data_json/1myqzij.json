    "Airtel works better Use cloudwarp 1.1.1.1 vpn to access everything\nâ””â”€â”€ Bro they've blocked it .....",
    "Nothing works",
    "Jio works better  But lowkey both are bad  Connectivity in that area is bad  Yall just have to rely on WiFi\nâ””â”€â”€ How to access the blocked sites? And they ainâ€™t handing out wifi passwords until unless we get our ID CARD\n    â”œâ”€â”€ They gave us the WiFi passwords on the first day itself  Idk why they are doing it differently now  As for the blocked sites we either used VPN or in the internet captive portal we used  Admin username and password  Which used to work back then  I think they took it down now\n    â””â”€â”€ Dm for an insane tip.\n        â”œâ”€â”€ Heyy, mind giving me the tip too plejðŸ¥¹\n        â””â”€â”€ Yo ,can you share it with me too",
    "Used to get 5g from jio on the 3rd floor, use warp for connectivity\nâ””â”€â”€ gng warp is no longer accessible ðŸ¥€\n    â””â”€â”€ huh I'm using it right now, as we speak\n        â””â”€â”€ Omg , what login credentials do you use dawg"
