    "\"rigorous\" is a very relative word, and i will agree that pes relative to most other comedk colleges is a little harder with the portion. And it doesn't help that the students themselves take the exams very seriously and study quite a bit more than they should. It's cause of the scholarship, touche jawahar.   But that being said, the \"seriousness\" I'm talking about is basically studying their asses off on the exam week, not like jee, not like boards. nobody cares about them to study for months before the exams. Think like 9th.  You'll mostly be fine if you start some basic studying 1-2 weeks before the exam. Pes doesn't teach us rocket science, it's not that hard, so chill out\n└── Thank you for taking the time to answer",
    "Quality of study >>> hours of study.. I know people have have studied last minute and scored better than people who have studied for 2 days.   Ideally it’s 50% understanding in class and 50% learning and practising it yourself.   Yes, you do get time away from academics, but only if you manage it wisely\n└── Thank you for taking the time to answer",
    "Bro chill out Start studying a month before exam and you’ll easily get 8+ peacefully and easily  You don’t even like have to study like 4 hours a day  Just start a month before And yore sorted Also you’ll have a hell lot of time Dw about that and all It’s not like you only have to study  You can do non tech stuff , fuck around all while getting 8+ ( but remember START EXACTLY ONE MONTH BEFORE EXAM. Don’t start 3 weeks before not 2 weeks before but 1 Month before ) Have fun bbg\n└── Thanks for the reply bro"
