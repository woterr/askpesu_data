    "This year syllabus is new.   But looking at the syllabus i can see some topics which can come :   1) HTTP status codes and their names , Difference between GET,POST,PUT,DELETE requests.   2) Css selectors.   3) javascript - const,var,let difference .   4) Hoisting and var scope (comes almost every time).   5) callback vs promises vs async/await (dealing with callback hell)   6) Http form submission    7) Stateful vs stateless components in React.   8) React Styling - inline styling , import css file etc\n└── Lmao why dont they teach Angular in PES?\n    └── React is fine i think , they have added nextJs as well this year.\n        └── Best, thats cool !!",
