    "Msrit, better student life, easier to score gpa, more time to spend on ur personal projects\n└── Hey I have to choose between msrit ise and pes ecity cse what should I go for?\n    └── My point still stands, CSE and AIML are almost the same at PES.\n        └── I do get your point but I feel I personally value the placement opportunities at pes more than the stuff you've mentioned considering how horrible the job market is and will be in like 4 years.\n            └── Perfectly valid, it goes both ways. Pesu has better placements, MSRIT allows u to work on ur own personal projects better. It's entirely gonna depend on how ull play the next 4 years. But yeah avg placements of PES is higher"
