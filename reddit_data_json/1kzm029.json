    "If your prof refuses to help out, you will simply have to hope that you do not get flagged while compiling the list of students with low attendance. If you are on that list, then you will need to attend extra classes (if they hold them, usually is the case).\n└── There are no attendance makeup classes this year\n    ├── yeah...though what goes of the prof for giving just 1-2 extra attendance if someone is just on the edge\n    └── Then OP is in deep shit"
