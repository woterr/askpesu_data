    "Bro it's max to max 20-25 minutes. If you get a scooty or a bike also it's mad chill. Although birla circle will have heavy traffic at times. Sometimes from Haralur road till Birla circle also. 1-2 times you come you'll understand.\n└── Problem is i have neither scooty nor bike and i am not interested spending daily on auto\n    └── Time to invest in one then. Saves you time and money."
