    "You could tell you have club activities or something, no?\nâ””â”€â”€ oh yeah this makes sense tysm ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­<3",
    "Probably yes , but you can edit the timetable pdf the college sends and try to gaslight them or say you have club activities\nâ””â”€â”€ BAHAHA thats what i had in my mind tbh until i remembered pes wants to involve parents in everything : |\n    â”œâ”€â”€ Not really, just empty threats dw.\n    â””â”€â”€ Actually they don't. My parents know nothing of what happens in college",
    "Who wants to stay in clg da\nâ””â”€â”€ I think its mainly about OP not wanting to go home rather than staying inside college lol\n    â””â”€â”€ Aah lol, makes sense",
    "whats the point of lying about this? Just say u wanna stay back in campus for a while\nâ””â”€â”€ you clearly do not have experience with strict parents so im not going to answer your question\n    â”œâ”€â”€ Honestly, just tell them you are trying to work with some profs and you have meetings with them after classes (that is anyway when these tend to happen). *Back in my time*, there wasn't any \"parents app\", but if the same timetable renders on both apps, there isn't anything you can do. Just be smart about it and come up with a solid excuse. If you cannot say working with profs, there are a bunch of other excuses from clubs to fests.\n    â”œâ”€â”€ I have strict parents but after a certain point u shud have made it clear to them that u want to do stuff and not tell them everything u do. My parents have eased up on me since I turned 18 cuz they know they can't keep controlling everything I do. U can try and persuade them , prolly take help frm ur older siblings who can relate\n    â”œâ”€â”€ ye but lying is a time bomb waiting to explode. God forbid they find out, they sure as shit wont think you stayed back to attend club meetings.\n    â””â”€â”€ there is nothing to help here tbh. just tell u have some work or something and move on. Done."
