    "Holidays? What that bro?  I been swimming through mud pools, fighting heat strokes and what not to get to clg and back.  But on a serious note, definitely lesser holidays than other colleges around and less forgiving. During the semester maybe around 10-15 days due to festivals, public holidays etc.  Around 1-2 weeks after odd sem.  2-3 months after even sem.  Check the FAQs once.  In your first year, this number will be lesser (1-2 months after even sem) to accomodate putting you back on a standardized schedule for the rest of your years.\nâ””â”€â”€ like even after 1st sem do we get 1-2 week holidays??? because someone told me only 25 th December is a holiday for the first sem.\n    â””â”€â”€ No you atleast get a week I'm sure.",

    "Bunk 3-4 days and go home clubbing it with a weekend every sem when u don't have any project submissions exams, etc and then try not to bunk too much apart from that, it's quite ez to maintain 75% attendance and u won't lose anything by bunking as u will anyways do self study most of the times.\nâ””â”€â”€ Okay Noted, Thank you ðŸ¥¹",
    "Summer break you might get 1.5 month holidays. Other than that the break b/w 1st and 2nd sem which is 12ish days.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ what abt diwali times    do we get a few holidays for that or no\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Mostly 1 day for festivals if it is a big one. During ongoing semesters holidays are less\nâ””â”€â”€ like even after 1st sem do we get 1-2 week holidays??? because someone told me only 25 th December is a holiday for the first sem.\n    â””â”€â”€ Pretty sure we had like one week. Check your calendar all holidays are given there.",
    "The main ones will be in Christmas and Summer.   You might get long weekends if a holiday happens on friday"
