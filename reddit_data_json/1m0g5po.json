    "Yes it will be like that, but if you take a special topic in third sem then you will have 3 full days+2 half days\n├── Special topic was mandatorily CIE for our batch, and that was online. So we had 3 half days and 2 full days, and it'll probably continue to be same.\n└── what are special topics?\n    └── During 3rd and 4th sem or during summer you will have to do a 2 credit subject which is called special topic",
    "may I know, whether Saturday is also a working day or not in the Uni and also in the first year how many full days will we have in the week ???? and what are the half day timings ???\n└── Saturday is never working, except in very exceptional cases. People have discussed working days and hours for each branch on discord, join the server and look it up."
