    "Dsa + projects, grind dsa in summer after 4th sem snd build some projects which are impressive and can talk about for 10-15 mins\n└── How to study dsa ?\n    ├── Complete a yt playlist or any online course that teaches u dsa theory (i recommend abdul bari's on udemy) so that u atleast have an idea abt all the algorithms and their time complexities and then u can start solving problems on leetcode/neetcode etc by following any of the roadmaps (strivers a2z is a good choice since ull have time if ur starting in 2nd year). Or you can just wait till u finish ur dsa in curriculum and start solving problems on leetcode after 3rd sem\n    └── Striver a2z sheet"
