    "For RR Campus:   Pros of hostel over pg:      1) They're definitely safer, I've heard incidents of robberies in some PGs but the good ones near the main road should be fine  2) Way more convenient in terms of distance for first years - Like F Block is literally next to the boys hostel  3) Food is healthy and you have options in hostel. Most pgs give bad food and people usually prefer the mess, there are 3 hostel messes to choose from depending on ur taste   4) It's way more fun because hostel is lively during events and matches ( cricket and stuff ) and festivals , and there's the feature of cloak rooms and vending machines and laundry at ur disposal , so its convenient.  5) NB , IH , MM and NBX Block rooms are pretty good too      Cons:   1) You need to take permission if ur going to be out after 10pm   2) You cant sneak in cake and some stuff but people still do so who cares   3) There's low chance of availability of hostel if ur from bangalore for this year\n└── Thanks bhaiya ❣️",
    "Pros:  1. Proximity to college, you won’t need to climb Mt.PESU 2. You don’t need to worry about food or laundry or safety 3. Friends, you’ll get to make good friends   Cons: 1. The WiFi is trash in hostel with lot of restrictions 2. The curfew and freedom can be a pain sometimes  3. The rooms with common bathroom aren’t that great"
