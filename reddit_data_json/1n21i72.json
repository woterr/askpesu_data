    "If your doing dsa try c++ it's better doing it in that.\n└── Thank you",
    "I would recommend C++",
    "C++ is best for DSA",
    "I'd recommend python or java.\n└── nahh python is a big No - like some companies dont even allow python in their OAs (Interviews ig its fine)  About Java - Its Fine for 98% of companies (Some companies like AMD and other semiconductor/embedded roles still ask for cpp)   But again once U get into a Job Java is widely used for application development  so for DSA I would say - cpp is the best   Good to know for Jobs once u get in - Java and Python\n    ├── What about C?\n    │   └── It's a pain to do some things in C  Like manual memory allocation etc (it's good for some use cases but not for dsa) For dsa cpp stl library makes the job easier  And cpp is very easy to learn once u learn c\n    └── Python is slow as fuck, use C++ or java, much better."
