  "content": "is metro and bus the only option, also it mit cse worth 32L over PESU EC Cse if it helps me skip daily travel for 3hrs (approximately 17-18kms) which is around 20L.. also going to manipal would require forcing my parents and alot of pressure for me to perform well, please help me *find out* travel ways and also choose my better option, PLEASE üôè (MONEY ISNT A ISSUE BUT I WANT TO BE RESPONSIBLE ENOUGH TO NOT DRAIN 12L AS IT MAY HAMPER MASTERS)",
