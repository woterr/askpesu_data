There’s no real learning or gaining of any kind of skills involved. PIL instead prioritises learning. All new recruits go through a summer internship working on projects mentored by seniors and alumni. Best place to be if you’re curious!\n\nAs for “well established”, PIL has been around for >13 years now I think."

The club has some of the most amazing people you’ll ever meet with an extensive alumni network. If politics excites you or if you like tongue twisting puzzles or if you simply want to belong to an active society, this is the college club for you. Also, the seniors ensure an environment where you get to interact with peers who are similar to you and contribute to collective development."
