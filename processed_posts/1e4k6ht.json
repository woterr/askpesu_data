      "body": "You seem to be a little off-time when it comes to booking at Vasundhara. There are usually 2 time slots during which people book:\n\n1. November end - December: Most final year students move out for internship and move closer to their offices in different parts of the city (or country). \n2. June-July: Students move out looking for other accommodation options or final years moving out early. You are a little late to enquire about this.\n\nYou can try asking the broker/owner who is in charge of those flats directly, instead of the guard. They will be more aware of when tenants will leave."
