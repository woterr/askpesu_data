I've been fortunate to get 7-9 from the ones I was close to but also unfortunate enough to get 2-3 from a few I felt I deserved more from.\n\nIt's best to get LORs from profs you have a working history with, either as a TA, RA or otherwise. Otherwise, the LOR doesn't carry too much weight (look into DWIC LORs)."
