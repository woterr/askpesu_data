  "content": "My 6th semester just ended and we got our results today. I currently have a CGPA of 7.8. With placements starting in 7th sem, I am concerned about whether this CGPA will help me land a tier 1 job.\n\nI haven‚Äôt received any summer internship offers from companies and I didn‚Äôt apply for internships in any research labs either. I‚Äôve mainly been focusing on improving my DSA in these 2 months. I keep hearing from seniors that many companies have an 8 CGPA cutoff and that‚Äôs really scaring the sh\\*t out of me, especially how tough the job market is right now.\n\nWould really appreciate any guidance, tips or just straight-up honesty. Am I already cooked or do I still have a chance? üò≠üôè",

Most importantly you should be preparing for the aptitude and other subject related matters because that's what matters the most towards the end."
