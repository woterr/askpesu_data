      "body": "Let me start from the beginning:\n\n## Credits\n\nTo obtain your degree, you need to gain a certain number of credits across the 4 years of study here. This number for my batch was 160 and ideally should remain the same for you as well. If you don't get 160 by the time graduation arrives, you simply won't be given your degree.  \nThese 160 credits are then distributed among courses. You would have noticed that some courses will have 5, 4 or 2 credits.  \n\nEach course will have a certain credits required, which will be awarded once you pass the course. Which means as long as you get above an F grade, you will pass the course and get those credits at the end of that semester. You either pass and get the full number of credits in that course, or you fail and you get 0, there is no partial credit. Since there is no concept of \"failing a year\", you can essentially fail all your courses in a year and still move on to the next year, but you would not have earned any credits. Credits are essentially weights for a course that determine how important they are. For example, a 4 credit course will have 4 hours of classes in a week, a 2 credit course will have 2 hours of classes in a week and so on.  \n\n## Mandatory and Optional coursework & Internship credits\n\nSome courses are mandatory, meaning you will have to pass them and get those credits while some of them (electives and special topics) aren't. If you withdraw from a course you'll need to make up for credits. You cannot skip out on mandatory courses.  \n\nCredits are also obtained via internships pursued at the end of 3rd year and in 8th semester. The details of how this conversion is made aren't relevant to your question so skipping it for now. Additionally, you can also take up some extra courses beyond the official curriculum to add credits. Note that there is no concept of early graduation at PES, so even if you finish BTech a year early they'll make you stay so there is no advantage from a time or financial point or view.\n\n## Calculating your GPA\n\nYour final marks for a course is a combination of ISA + ESA + assignments + project + etc combined in some weighted fashion. Now marks are mapped to Grades with 90+ being S, 80-89 being A, 70-79 being B and so on. Grades are then assigned numbers with S grade = 10, A = 9 and so on. \n\n### Relative Grading?\n\nNo, PESU does not follow any relative grading. There is a fixed formula used to calculate your GPAs. However, sometimes, when a batch performs poorly in a course they will shift the marks-to-grade mappings (so maybe instead of 90+ being an S they shift it to 85+). This isn't the accurate definition of *relative*, and additionally we do not know how they *determine the magnitude of the shift* so it's not a transparent process. \n\nSGPA is a weighted average of grades in a semester where the weights are the credits for that course. So,\n\n>SGPA = sum(credits for course \\* grade obtained in course)/total credits in semester\n\nCGPA is again a weighted average of your SGPA, where the weights are the credits in that semester. So,\n\n>CGPA = sum(credits in semester \\* SGPA in semester)/total credits across all semesters\n\nYou can also use [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EUXscZPrBGKSxbk2howqwZGC96whG_ncXQL_2_3YLts/view) spreadsheet to calculate your GPA. Instructions are in the sheet. You will need to create a copy on your Google Drive from settings and then edit it."

People usually take these to decrease the number of courses needed to be taken in the final year. Sometimes the department might also let you swap these credits for other special topics you have taken during the semester (T&C apply)."
