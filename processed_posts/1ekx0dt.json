  "content": "Im gonna join PES EC campus this year. I wanna know which one's better, hostel or PG. I know the situation for first year. I want to enjoy my time after college gets over by 4 or smtg. I wanna play sports or just hang out with friends or if required study together with friends . But the buses from college end at 4or5. Ill try to get a cycle or bike, but i saw in the FAQ section that cycles r not allowed. is that true??\n\n I saw that the curfew is 7 or 7:30, which seems riddiculus. I saw the sports facilities and gym open still 7 in the college. So if I get done with that at 7, how am i supposed to report back to hostel?? How strict is this curfew. Like if i am doing something genuiene in college itselft like playing badminton in MRD or going to gym in mrd, will i be allowed to do that till 7 and be allowed back in the hostel?? \n\n**IM ASKING THIS FOR THE FIRST YEAR HOSTEL WHICH IS 7km AWAY**\n\nAlso I like to have a bit freedom and i like my privacy beeing respected, which seems hard to find if i go to hostel.\n\nSo is it worth the cost for me to be in the hostel or should i get a PG. Please suggest what i shld do.",
