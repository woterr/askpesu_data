      "body": "Also important to note that it gets progressively harder to score in each passing semester because of the exponentially increasing workload. \n\nIt's not that difficult to give yourself a solid GPA in first year, and to a fair degree in second. Third is more about balancing that GPA. In fourth year since you barely have any courses, even if you get a 10 GPA it barely affects your CGPA so it's too late by then."
