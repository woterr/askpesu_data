Don't waste your money on buying textbooks , slides and softcopy of textbooks will be provided and you can always borrow from the library.\n\n\nYou can visit Dmart nearby once you'll get most of the stuff you need at discounted prices ."

Once the things settle down after like 1 month, and the hostel people are not uptight anymore, ig it won't be a problem to use it. But yeah kettle is useful for boiling water, coffee or maggie. Gotta satisfy those late night cravings."
