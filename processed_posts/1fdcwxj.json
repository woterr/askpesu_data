  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m thinking of joining PES University for an MBA, specifically in Operations Management and Business Analytics. I’ve read a lot about the admissions process, and it seems quite hyped. I wanted to get a clearer picture from current students or recent graduates.\n\n* How is the quality of the courses and professors?\n* Are the MBA placements good?\n* Is the program for Operations Management and Business Analytics well-structured?\n* How is the ROI for those who joined through PGCET?\n* Any pros and cons you’ve experienced?\n\nWould really appreciate your honest feedback. Thanks!",
