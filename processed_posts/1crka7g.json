They're just trying to forget about it and move in because it affects their brand and reputation. I don't see a point in defending their actions. The only reason I got to know was through my frnds. Shouldn't PES at least say ok this has happened, let's try to find out why and change some stuff or smtg? No. We haven't even been asked if there's anything bothering us and the mentor program is still worthless. At least this one they can't change into an accident because it'll look even worse on the college if a student had an accident because of their poor infrastructure. 4 suicides in less than 1 year is horrible man"

I’m 19 years old and made the decision to go abroad for studies and have been living by myself for almost a year now, making a living alongside getting good grades at university. If the kids at PES say that their college puts too much pressure on them then they have no idea what life can do. Never has the any thought relating to suicide ever crossed my mind even at my lowest. So the next time someone tries to say they are facing college pressure please take a good look around with your fucking eyes. You have no idea how easy your life is if the only “pressure” on you is by your college/university."

You are of course, free to have your own opinion on the matter.\n\n>here we already know that they are guilty, an entire class room saw the boy jump and everyone know that he was denied writing the exam right before this happened\n\nI will iterate: we do not have enough information to decide this. We do not know *how* late the student arrived. That is what will actually determine who is at fault.\n\nCheck the ESA instructions which are always, before any ESA, emailed/sent over notifications. There is a clause that mentions that you will not be permitted 30 mins after the start time. If the student arrived within the stipulated time, I agree ([and have commented numerous times on another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/1crqziu/comment/l40w1a9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)), that the faculty is at fault and there should be consequences.\n\nHowever, if the student did arrive 30 mins after the start time, is the faculty at fault for carrying out his responsibility? Or is the student responsible for arriving late? If one day you arrived late for a job interview at the company of your dreams and they ended up skipping you, would you hold yourself responsible for being late, or would you blame the recruiter/company for being strict?"

So stop being a clown and pulling accusations out of your ass. You're just here to stir up drama.\n\n>And he's done it cuz they didn't let him write an exam cuz he's late even though some leniency wouldn't have killed them,\n\nThe rule states that you are not permitted more than 30 mins after the exam begins. This 30 mins *is* the leniency. How much more leniency do you expect in a 3 hour exam? An exam hall isn't your home where you can walk in whenever you feel like. You should be grateful that PES even *has* a leniency period of 30 mins.\n\nYou gave the JEE Mains this year right? Would love to see you walk up to your exam center 30 mins after the exam begins and then demand the security personnel to let you in. Do you think you would have been allowed to give the exam, knowing that a full year of effort is wasted? Would you blame yourself for arriving late or the security for not letting you in?\n\nHowever, as I stated: we do not have enough information to decide who is at fault. To actually know that, we need to know *how* late the student arrived. If they arrived <30 mins before the exam, then I agree, action must be taken. But as of now, there is no info on this.\n\n>you don't gain shit by defending their actions\n\nYou are right. That is why if you read my past comments about PES, I have been critical where due. As recently as a week or so ago when I posted why PES is not worth it, or a few months ago when I have posted numerous negative comments about the mismanagement, poor faculty etc at this university. I have always remained neutral and unbiased when it comes to giving feedback about PES, you would know this if you were regular on this subreddit."
