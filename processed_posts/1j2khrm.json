  "content": "\nJio used to work perfectly fine on the EC campus, but for the past two weeks, it has turned into absolute gutter trash. I canâ€™t load shit. And PESU WiFi is just as useless, it logs me out constantly and refuses to connect when I actually need it.\n\nIt took me 10 whole minutes just to pay the auto Anna because of this shit. I had to walk around campus like an idiot just to find a signal. \n\n",
