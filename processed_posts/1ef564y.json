They only book to fill the seats so idt you’ll have to stand, but when the bus goes by the Mysore metro station all the pes kids coming from metro get on the bus, so it gets really cramped for like 3 minutes. You should be sitting by then tho. Make sure to note the drivers name and number so you can call him if you ever miss the bus and check where the next stop is."
