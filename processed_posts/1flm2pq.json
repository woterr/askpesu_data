      "body": "They don't make you do anything. But it just ends up being a lot of work. \nThe thing is that they expect a research paper to come out of your project. And doing a good project, enough to have a presentable paper, in the six weeks is tough. \nBut it's nothing too bad. This year it was 9-4 4 days a week. If you put all your efforts during that time right from the beginning you'll be good to go."
