I found engaging while studying CADD, ANALOG CIRCUIT DESIGN, and DIGITAL VLSI, the projects that I have done we're also intresting; therefore, I want to choose VLSI as my domain \n\n Summer courses are announced but I am unable to choose. Which among the courses are should I choose..\n 1) Analog IC design\n2) VLSI design flow (RTL to GDS) \n3) microcontroller assembly programming\n4) programming with 8051\n5) programming with 8086\n\n If have taken any of the above subjects, please let me know how they are",
