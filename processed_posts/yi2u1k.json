  "content": "So I have already gotten Pes EC Cse in round 1 of Kcet but i also have a chance of getting AI/ML in BMS and MSRIT in Comedk round 2. I've heard that Pes is very hectic and also that Ecity campus has lower fests too. Although, it is relatively chill in the latter colleges.\n\nBTW, will students of AI/ML branch be allowed to sit for Cse and Ece placements?? \n\nand also i might get ISE in BMS in mopup round of comedk. So please note that too.",

So if you want to pick a slightly more balanced college life, I'd suggest BMS.\n\nYou need to tell us which you prioritise more - the branch or the college. If I were you I'd pick PES CSE. Not only do you get pure CSE and the chance to pick your own specialisation (and also pursue AIML if you're interested) but you also have great placements here (which are better than BMS last time I checked). But be prepared to be in for a very stressful college life if you join here."

And by now, most of the engineering exams' counselling has long been completed, so a lot of people already got filtered that way. \n\nAnd its not just the top 3 colleges, thats how it is in almost all colleges. Lesser competition for now sooðŸ¤·"
