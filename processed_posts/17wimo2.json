  "content": "Hello PESU folks, we're scouting for some great people to join our team as UX Interns and Campus Ambassadors for Sling - your next favourite college social app.\n\nBoth of these will be paid, with the latter being performance based.\n\nFor campus ambassadors, we'd prefer folks in their sophomore/junior/senior years, and for UX, we'd mainly be looking at your portfolio.\n\nIf you're interested, reach out to us at [info@joinsling.com](mailto:info@joinsling.com), or message us here.\n\n\\--\n\nMore about Sling:\n\nSling is a social + anonymous social media focused on colleges.\n\nAs the description suggests, there are two modes, '**Anon**' and '**Public**'.\n\n* You can choose your vibe, by sharing your thoughts anonymously in 'Anon' mode, with people from your university, or others.\n* ...or you could engage openly with just the people from your university in 'Public' mode.\n* Folks are verified through their **university email**, making sure there are no imposters and keeping things genuine.\n\nYou can talk about anything under the sun.\n\nHere's a play store link: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.slinglabs.sling](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.slinglabs.sling) if you want to check it out.",
