      "body": "The tier system is vague and subjective. There is no official metric that determines how colleges fall into tiers. But the reality is that unless you are going to an IIT, NIT, BITS, IISc, IIIT, or one of a few other *extremely* well-recognized colleges, nobody cares where you are from, and that is the case with PES; you will thus not find any \"reliable\" source to tell you about its tier.\n\nFor its reputation, it does a great job with placements and is absolutely average at everything else. It is nowhere near the colleges I listed, but it is definitely a good choice for most looking to study CS if you can't get into them.\n\n*Of course, we are also known as IIT Bangalore, but there are other reasons.*"
