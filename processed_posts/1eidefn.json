      "body": "Bootstrap is a 5 day program where you guys are divided into 5 groups. These groups are usually named red, blue, etc. \n\nEach group has one theme per day. The themes are mechanical, design thinking, community service etc. \n\nDuring design thinking, you have a hackathon style event  \nDuring mechanical, you get a presentation about the latest advancements (boring shit) and then move on to the interesting stuff (The Aero design club, Avions; the go kart club vegavath) etc. \n\nYou also have electrical, electronics etc. \n\nOn the community service day, you usually go to a school to paint their walls or some other sort of community service like that. \n\nIt's a really fun thing that takes place during the first week of your first year. It gives a glimpse of all the departments and clubs in the university"

You get to meet your batchmates and seniors as well, break the ice, make friends etc. The activities are simply to help you bond over some event. \n\nWhile bootstrap is optional, it's highly recommended so you can go around campus, get a feel of college life and make new friends."
