This later translates into TA experience and a good LOR, which will help you a lot during MS admissions. These are the explicit advantages, beyond that it won't help you too much."

      "body": "You don't need a super high CGPA. You don't even need an S grade in the course you want to TA for (but it does make things easier). The minimum requirement set by the Uni is that you have already taken up and cleared the course. Beyond that, profs might have other subjective requirements like a minimum grade, how much you participated in class, etc.\n\nProfs primarily look for people who have a good grasp of the course, are genuinely interested and are passionate about that topic and are helpful, diligent and can get things done on time. If you have these qualities, you become a strong candidate for a TA. In some cases, they might even reach out to you to be their TA (happened to me for another course, but had to turn it down because I was already swamped with internship work that semester). \n\nAnd it isn't a waste of time if the TAship is good. I was the TA for Big Data and working with KVS has taught me a lot on not just advanced concepts from the topics but also matters beyond academics :). Working with him as his TA was a wonderful experience, and it goes to show that your experience will also greatly depend on the prof you TA for."

Firstly, being a TA in ECE is really super helpful in case you want to get *recommendation letters.* Another perk is that you get paid 1000Rs **in case you are TA in your final year only**   \n2. The amount of work, depends on subject and teacher, but ensure to be a TA, where there are other TAs for same subject, so that work is distributed among TAs.\n\nAll the best"
