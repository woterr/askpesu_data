      "body": "The placement office is common, but the placement stats are a little skewed towards the main campus. Yes, both the campuses sit for placement tests together, BUT, main campus students get selected for top companies initially. At least the initial 1-2 months are skewed. However, everyone in CSE gets placed, so it's chill. I'd still suggest the main campus over the south campus."

      "id": "k1d8vc2",
      "body": "But yeah, CSE is over-crowded in PES. So it's a little hard to get internships initially. If we're talking pure opportunities, I don't think anyone would ever have to worry. They'll always be more than enough in PES, but, competition would be equally hard coz of the numbers. Maybe other places it would be easier to get an job/internship coz of lower batch strength, that's a negative I can think of"

They've considerably increased the CSE batch every year and ig that's why numbers always look small. In terms of getting opportunities, they'll get you ample. But it's down to you and competition at the end of the day"
