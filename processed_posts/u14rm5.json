  "content": "Hey seniors, I got my first semester results yesterday and got very bad sgpa. My parents are very disappointed but luckily they still believe in me. \nHonestly it’s my fault, I didn’t real put that much effort, but also our semester was 3 months long with 6 months worth of syllabus.\nFucked it up badly, got only 5.9GPA.\nCan I increase gpa to 7.5+ in the coming semesters? Can you give me some tips/advice/motivation? I’m in a really bad place rn, and I don’t wanna waste my parent’s money",

I have seen a lot of folks who score 6 sgpa in 1st sem ending up with 8+ cgpa by the end of their course. Also word of advice: 1st year supposed to be chill. 2nd year and 3rd dont mess up. Most ideal situation after 6 sems is 8+ cgpa but it takes a good amount of effort. Even if u dont get that 7+ is a must if u wanna be placed."
