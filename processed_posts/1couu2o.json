So  if you have 23-25/50 that's like 15 out of 40 assuming you thought internals is 10 marks. Now assuming you submitted all the lab stuff and got good in the quiz(best case), add 30 to 15 we have 45. If you want B grade, 0.7*120 =84. So you need 39 more marks so 78 in ESA\n\nPerfectly achievable since CN is a 5 credit course. You have 2 days to prepare as well"
