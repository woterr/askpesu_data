I don't remember the exact number for the fees but it was pretty liberal. You also have badminton courts(silicon floor), billiards, darts, chess, a running track, squash etc in the same building."

      "body": "The gym price is 6k per year, along with the gym there are many games and sports you can play in the mrd center like chess, carrom, table tennis, snookers, squash and badminton. \nHowever these are all inside the campus, so you have to probably stay back after your college or have to travel additional 10km up-down from the Hostel. There is a ground and a basketball court in amaatra hostel, the gym there is a cubical trash with a bench, a treadmill and some dumbbells throw around. There is no table tennis or any kind of indoor games available in the Hostel. \nAnd one important to remember is the cerfuee timing is 7pm, so you even have to manage that."
