      "body": "I secured 97.51%tile in JEE Mains 2024 in the April Attempt. I applied in PES through JEE Mains quota and was offered all the courses in RR and EC campus except for CSE and AIML. So I would say 98%tile+ would be the cutoff for CSE. I took up B.Tech ECE in RR campus. I wish they had scrapped PESSAT right from 2024. I would have benefited from that. Now since that there is not PESSAT and only JEE Mains, KCET and Mgmt, the cutoff would probably decrease for all branches including CSE. So anywhere above 96-97 would put you on a safer side. For CSE try to keep atleast above 97.5%tile."
