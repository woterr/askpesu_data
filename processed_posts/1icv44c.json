Assuming you have 8 in both sem 1 and sem 2 (which you donâ€™t), even if you score perfect 10 in both sems to get your CGPA to 9.04 even then you wonâ€™t get the MRD scholarship. You can aim for CNR tho since itâ€™s on the basis of SGPA and not CGPA. If u score a sgpa 8.6-8.7, you should be fine but there have been some exceptional cases (like the sem when I asked this question) the cutoff was 8.83 and it was even 9 for some seniorsâ€¦ so according to other peopleâ€™s performance it varies but in normal scenarios, 8.6-8.7 or anything above it will get your CNR"
