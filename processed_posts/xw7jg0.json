  "content": "I've asked a few teachers for LOR, and they have told me to draft it. How does it work now? I've sent the drafts, will they edit it and make it professional by adding letter-head and all that? Or should I do that too? Cuz this feels really weird lol.\n\nAny senior/current aspirant who has gone through this hell, please enlighten me.",

They'll suggest any changes/additions/subtractions and also share the \"formal format\"\n\nPost that, the department will print it out on Bond Paper (i hope they still do it) and give you, but you'll be mostly using the digital copy, so it's fine if you don't get the print out"
