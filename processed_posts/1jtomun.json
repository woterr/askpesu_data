If you look outside the boys washrom on the first floor, you can see like a billion dead pigeons just rotting there, so much fucking trash thrown there. I dont understand how hard it is to throw waste in a dustbin, the whole of ec campus has rubbish everywhere and is such an eyesore. These are the type of people that wanna live abroad, useless fuckers, dont even have the basic civic sense to walk up to a dustbin and throw the trash there. Fuck EC Campus, genuinely hate it so fucking much"
