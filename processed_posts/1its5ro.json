Study properly from the slides to answer MCQs correctly.\n\nMPCA: 4Ms were like tough and I personally didn't like them. Even MCQs were tough. Mostly the paper was numerical based.\n\nDAA: It will be easy dw just study the concepts properly. Plenty of yt resources available for this.\n\nLAA: Scoring paper, it will be easy."
