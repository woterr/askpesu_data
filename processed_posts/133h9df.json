Relying on them will just lead you to screw up. It’s better to learn yourself from online sources. If you prefer learning on your own by experimenting or building a project, try  [phind.com](https://phind.com) for all your queries. If you want a more structured approach, you can try reading the prescribed textbook. Trust me it’s not that boring. The prescribed book is ‘The C Programming Language’ by Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan. They are the inventors of C so you know they know shit. \n\nIf you still find books boring like I do, you can try the CS50 course by Harvard. There’s a freecodecamp video of it on YouTube. It’s more general and will make you fall in love with CS. \n\nIf you lack time and want something to just pass the exams, try the Neso Academy’s course on C. I’ll paste a link here if you ask"
