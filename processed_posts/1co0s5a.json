This was answered multiple times over the last 2 weeks and there are numerous posts about it.\n\n>My jee main percentile is 92. Is it possible to get any good branch or any branch in PES University\n\nCutoff for CS is 98 percentile. Other branches will be lower than that."

I also know he applied kinda late so that might be a factor as well. \n\nYou most likely will not get cs or ece with 92 percentile so don't get your hopes up. But apply nonetheless. Also just go write pessat, it's easier to get in and for the same fee"
