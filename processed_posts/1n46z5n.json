  "content": "The placement rate is reported to be 47%. I am concerned about this statistic and would like to understand it better. Does this mean that approximately half of the students do not secure a job placement? I am willing putting a lot of effort into my studies and ofcourse skills and want to ensure I have a good chance of being placed after graduation. Could you please provide a clear explanation of what this placement percentage entails, using full words instead of abbreviations?\n",

If the students who were planning to do their master‚Äôs didn‚Äôt end up going, would the percentage have gone up to around 85%? I know it‚Äôs tough to predict and involves a lot of guesswork, but I just want to get a feel of the environment and how much the university can actually help with job placements.\n\n\n2. I‚Äôve got other options like BMSCE, MSRIT, and DSCE. Do you think choosing PES with all the extra effort it takes for VTU would actually pay off in the long run? Is the effort worth it? As apparently they have a better placement percentage"

      "body": "The placement % numbers will never be accurate simply because there's no way to accurately determine it. PES only has the data they have access to. PPOs offered to students at the end of their summer/spring internship are usually between the company and the student, so PES doesn't have any information here. Additionally, many students apply off campus and get into different companies (sometimes abroad as well), and these aren't on PES' record either. \n\nThe *only* record PES has is the number of students directly placed through their placement cycle, which is absolutely not representative by any means."
