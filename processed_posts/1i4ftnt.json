  "content": " Rowlet-Owl changed my life. He encouraged me to embrace my true self—my real identity, my pronouns, and my true sense of being. I am Rowlet-Owl-sexual. I will share this with my parents during dinner, hoping they don’t try to set me up with someone else. To represent the Rowlet-Owl community, I plan to wear a cardboard Rowlet-Owl costume and intentionally move in slow motion at half a meter per hour during a 10 km marathon to showcase the steady, deliberate grace of my muse.\n\nThank you, Rowlet-Owl, for helping me cast away the false sense of normalcy society gave me and guiding me to embrace the real me, even if that real me lives in delusion. Thank you for always showing me a perspective that reminds me there’s beauty in life’s quirks and imperfections. Long live Rowlet-Owl. Be proud, Rowlet-Owl-sexuals, and embrace who you truly are!",
