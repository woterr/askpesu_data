  "content": "Guys I have lost my hydron collider somewhere near BE block. I am in a desperate bid to get it back.\n\nIt's a high energy hydron collider, approximately 1.5 meters in height, with a cylindrical stainless steel housing and a series of superconducting niobium-titanium alloy coils. It operates at a nominal energy range of 14 tera-electron volts, capable of accelerating proton beams to 99.999% the speed of light. The collider is equipped with a cryogenic cooling system to maintain operational temperatures near absolute zero, and its integrated diagnostics panel features a high-resolution liquid crystal display for real-time monitoring of particle trajectories, beam luminosity, and collision events.\n\nThe exterior is marked with several hazard warnings, including “Caution: High-Field Magnetic Containment” and “Risk of Microsingularity Formation,” as well as a serial number (HC-0420) etched near the base. The collider emits a low-frequency hum at approximately 60 decibels, consistent with the operation of its cryopumps and vacuum systems. It also has a distinct blue Cherenkov radiation glow when active, due to the relativistic particles traversing the surrounding medium.\n\nIf you’ve encountered a device matching this description perhaps misidentified as an industrial grade espresso machine or a avant-garde art installation—please contact me immediately.Thank you.",
