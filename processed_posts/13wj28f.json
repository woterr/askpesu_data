So just prepare well , answer as much as you can , and this year fee has been increased so ig the cutoff will drop. \nPessat cutoff for rr cse was 1.2k and ec was 3.3k (2nd round)"

If you're REALLY lucky you might clear the exam with minimal prep.\n\nMy friend last year who had a rank of 90k~ cleared pessat and got a branch in EC (I think AIML)."
