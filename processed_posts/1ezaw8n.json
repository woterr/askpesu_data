Also, saying that you left a university for another just makes you a person that is actually uninterested in PES. \n\nYou didn’t get a branch that you wanted, that’s not leaving a college. If you got CS at NIT, then moved here for CS, that is leaving a college for another. You chose this university with all sanity. Be proud of it."

I'm in fact happy for getting pes thru cet where the fee is 5l for the whole four years.. \n\nAnd coming to this post, this was actually a shit post made for fun and i have nothing to demean pes (why will i even do this)"
