  "content": "Hi all,\n\nJust wanted to share a small Chrome extension I put together calledÂ **Simple Tab Session Saver**. I built it mainly because I needed a better way to save all the tabs related to different classes without cluttering things up.\n\nHere's what it does:\n\n* **Save:**Â Select open tabs, give the group a name, and save it.\n* **Restore:**Â Opens all tabs from a saved session in aÂ **new window**.\n* **Manage:**Â Preview tabs in a session, edit session names, search your saved list.\n* **Customize:**Â Choose light or dark mode.\n\nIt's nothing too fancy, just aims to be a helpful tool for staying organized with browser tabs. Figuring out how to build it was fun.\n\nYou can find it on the Chrome Web Store (it's free):Â [https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/simple-tab-session-saver/fdffmopbfnipkbaiikphcnlmdgeodjpc?authuser=0&hl=en-GB](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/simple-tab-session-saver/fdffmopbfnipkbaiikphcnlmdgeodjpc?authuser=0&hl=en-GB)\n\nIf you end up trying it, I'd love to hear any feedback! Hope it might be helpful for some of you too. ðŸ™‚  \nCounting on reddit for some support :)",

      "body": "Think of native Chrome Tab Groups like organizing the documents currently spread out on your desk for immediate visual clarity. They're excellent for managing your active workspace within that window.\n\nThis extension operates a bit differently. It functions more like taking inventory of selected documents on your desk (saving their web addresses, or URLs), filing that list under a specific project name in your records (chrome.storage.sync), and clearing those physical papers away if you choose. Later, when you need to revisit that project, you can retrieve the list and instantly open fresh copies of each document (load the URLs into tabs) together on a completely separate, clean desk (a new browser window).\n\nSo, while both help with organization, this extension focuses onÂ **persistently saving named sets of web addresses**Â for easy retrieval and context switching into new windows, rather than just visually grouping currently open tabs."
