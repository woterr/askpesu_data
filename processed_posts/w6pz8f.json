But the pressure of drop year and what's everyone is telling about it is scaring the shit out of me so I'm not sure and asked here. And yes I am general :("

Figure out if you're ready to put the effort and commitment to achieve this.\n\nI would consider a drop year only if fees would be a problem to pay for PES."
