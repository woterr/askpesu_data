  "content": "Apple's come for placements, and I have a few questions to the seniors who've worked at Apple OR anyone who's got inputs. \n\n1. As Apple has offices both in Bangalore and Hyderabad, which one do they recruit us for? Is it the same location for everyone or is it based on some individual requirements/performance? Would it be the same location for FTE in case they give a PPO or do I have the flexibility to choose? \n\n2. How's it working at Apple IS&T, specifically? Do you get to work on meaningful projects? Would love to hear more about the experience.\n\n3. What kind of questions are asked in the interviews, and any specific tips to prepare? \n\nIt would really help if you could guide me, and I'm open to advice.",
