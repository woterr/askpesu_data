  "content": "Iâ€™ve had a mediocre start with a GPA of 8.81 in my first two semesters. I want to improve in 3rd sem but unlike the first 2 sems I don't know what my strong subjects and weak subjects are just yet. I'm also very scared of the fact that I might screw up ISA-1 terribly and end up with less than 25-30 in all subjects and this is causing me to lose a lot of sleep everyday. I don't think I have written an ISA/ESA without being super stressed out and anxious causing me to be sick prior to the exams and this has made me come to loathe the week leading upto these tests and the tests themselves.\n\nIs there anything I can do reduce this anxiety and what can I do to ensure I can cross 9 ish gpa by the end of this year? Thanks a lot guys.",
