      "body": "The electives that the ECE department offers changes for every batch depending on the teachers and how many people choose the electives. If less than 30 people choose an elective, it'll be cancelled and the students who picked it will be asked to select a different one which has a strength of more than 30. The electives for each year keep changing and what we had might not be the same ones you have.\n\nMinors are seperate subjects taught by another department. Unlike electives, they're completely optional and do not affect your final grade in any way. They have teachers from other departments that take classes for you outside clg hours and have seperate ISAs and ESAs. You also need to pay to take up each of these courses either during college or in the holidays. It's 2500 per credit for any cs minor course"
