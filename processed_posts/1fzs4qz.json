That long journey is going to take a toll on you on a daily basis.\n\n\nCrowd wise I've heard a lot of people just leave as soon as class gets over, not a lot of people stay for clubs and stuff. But some of the smartest people I know are in EC campus, try to find those smart guys in your batch and mingle.Â "
