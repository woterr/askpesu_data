      "body": "PESU has 3 main academic performance scholarships/certificates. Now the reason seniors are confused are because (1) they keep changing the names and (2) they keep changing the criteria. So keep things simple, I'll just explain what they were named with what the criteria was for my batch, back when I graduated in 2022:\n\n1. Distinction Award Certificate - a certificate (no money) given to those who cross 7.5 SGPA in a semester\n2. MRD Scholarship - top 20% of a branch by SGPA gets back x% of their semester tuition fee. They also get a certificate for the same. The minimum SGPA for this depends on the last person who is in the top 20% of the branch.\n3. CNR Rao Scholarship - the branch toppers with the highest CGPA in a semester get back x% of their semester fees. They also get a certificate for the same. The minimum CGPA for this again depends on the last branch topper for the branch. If I remember correctly, they only pick the first 10 or so. \n\nIn a semester, you can only be eligible for one scholarship, but you will get certificates for every award you are eligible for. So if you are a branch topper, you would get only CNR scholarship but certificates for all 3. \n\nNow as I said, this was what it used to be in 2022. If someone knows the most updated criteria and names, they can reply to this comment."
