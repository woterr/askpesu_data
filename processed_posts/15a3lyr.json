  "content": "Does PES increase the tuition fees/annual college fees year wise? For the upcoming batch, the annual fee year wise is 4.5 lakh (tuition fee + exam/university fee), for CSE and CSE (AI&ML) branches. When I enquired with the college people, they said it will remain the same for the next 4 years and won't increase. Is it true? How has it been for students from earlier batches? Please help.",
