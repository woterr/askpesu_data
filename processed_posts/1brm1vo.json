Did he say it in front of your parents or directly to you. \n\nAlso could you just generally provide an idea of what to study, what to learn, how exactly internships and job selections work. \n\nI'm in my second year and do well in the college stuff. It's pretty easy so last minute study is more than enough. I want to do better but I waste all the time i have. Anything you think i should be doing instead?"

      "body": "PES has a good reputation, at least at the time I was signing up for admission, and parents used to buy seats as a backup for their kids so it didn’t really matter to the admissions office. \nTo answer your question, they said it to my parents and I came to know about it last year.\n\nIt’s good that you’re thinking about being better.\n\nIf you think academics are something that you can easily take care of, I would suggest exploring your interests as much as possible. I can’t emphasise this enough. \nThis time won’t come back. \n\nBe as ambitious as you can. Start a club or join a club, could be dance or chess or even something that’s relevant to your stream. (Example - We had Microsoft club not sure if it’s there now)\nBeing a 2nd year student, you could intern with a startup (saying startups because they’re the ones who are short of people), and I’m pretty sure Bangalore has plenty of these. Use personal network, LinkedIn and I guess there are some websites that can help get you internships.\n\nYou could explore entrepreneurial interests - working on something that can benefit everyone in the college maybe (dating app maybe? Lol), an app for hostelites, etc.\n\n\nAs for placements, I’m not sure what branch you’re from but I’ll answer from a CSE perspective.\n- Online test - can be aptitude or coding\n- interviews: \nCoding round - Leetcode (there are patterns which can help you learn quickly - grokking the coding interview)\nSystem design - gaurav sen YouTube \nBehavioural - Google - “most common behavioural interviews” and write down answers for them because in most of the cases you won’t have a proper answer on top of your mind.\n\nYou could be asked about your projects too.\n\nThere are some companies that offer internships for the 8th semester. So if you clear the placement round you get both FTE and intern offers\n\nHope this helps"

During my placements I saw 7 being the cut-off for most and some had 8 too, but very few. \n- Higher education - if you’re going abroad for studies, your entire profile is assessed including your academics. \n\nYour GPA will matter only during placements uske baad kisi ko ghanta farak padta hai."

Look for internal transfer.\n2. Market is improving, so you could reach out for referrals, reach out to recruiters on LinkedIn, upload profile on job sites like naukri .\n3.

      "body": "Congrats first of all.\n\nEngineering and Law are two completely different fields, lead to different paths and career trajectories. The fact that you’re open to engineering, tells me that you don’t have clarity and that is okay.\n\nLaw is something niche and in order to see growth  in that field you will likely need higher education.\n\nWhile things can change in the future, think about what you want now, whether studying law is something that you might like (or engineering), career prospects, salaries, growth, etc. Try attending a lecture in both engineering and law if possible. Talk to recent grads, law grads who are working and also those who have just started studying law.\n\nI would suggest you to think about a backup if law doesn’t work out for you.\nFor many, masters is a second chance at career. For example, MBA is an option for many just because they decided that they didn’t want to pursue a profession in their initial field. (So in a year or so, if you know that law isn’t for you, you could spend time prepping for masters - building a profile, etc)\n\nWhile I don’t know how PES Law is, I can tell you about engineering.\n\n\nMost of the people do engineering because that’s what they’ve seen in the family and that was correlated with intellectual capability (and also because of lack of clarity).\n  \nAlmost in all engineering colleges, CSE is the most preferred branch, then Electronics, Mechanical, Civil etc\n\nPeople choose branches other than CSE because they either didn’t get CSE or they were really passionate about the Non CSE branch. (In most cases, it’s the former)\n\nThe academics is pretty standard, first year is common for all and the remaining 3 years, you’ll study subjects relevant to your branch. \n\nThe end goal for most is to get a high paying through college placements.\nMost Tech companies will prefer EC and CSE students for their interviews (at least this is what I’ve seen during my placements) and PES does get a lot of tech companies. (Might be the most in Karnataka)\n\nAt PES there are fewer opportunities for someone from NON CSE branches to get into core companies so students who don’t get into core companies either get placed in companies which weren’t the first preference or end up doing masters.\n\nIt should be noted that the above is not a generalisation but something that I saw.\n\n(Just an FYI, if you plan to do an MBA abroad, non engineering Indian candidates have better chances at admissions in good colleges - obviously subject to good scores, profile, etc😛)\n\nAll the best."
