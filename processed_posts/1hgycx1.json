First focus on getting that gpa above 7. You'll be eligible for 75% of the companies. \nDon't waste time at the start of your next semester, because once isa1 gets over, there is no coming back or \" I will shut up and study\" because you'll have assignments and isa 2 in no time. So be proactive, study hard, make notes at home. If you get above 85% in ur isas it would give you enough momentum and you'll be technically good enough to do well in the ESA. Don't learn for the sake of marks and study to become a good engineer as all 4th sem subjects are important fundamentals."
