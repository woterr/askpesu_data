The security does not say anything if you wear the temporary id.  \nWhen entering libraries, sometimes they may ask to scan it, just tell them it's temporary, and you'll get the proper one when you start your session next month.   \nFor wifi, I just took the credentials of a senior who I know, you can do this too.  \n  \nOr try:  \nUsername - graviton01\n\nPassword - graviton01\n\ngraviton02 and graviton03 should work too  \n  \nA senior said they were given these credentials in an old hackathon, and they still work. Haven't tried them myself, though."

As far as I know, once you actually join, you'll be using your srn only everywhere.\n\nSo yeah, the one on your temporary id is prn, and you'll get your srn later."
