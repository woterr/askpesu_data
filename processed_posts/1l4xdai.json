  "content": "I'm joining PES University this year and trying to decide between staying in the PES hostel or finding a PG nearby.\n\nI've heard mixed opinions, so I wanted to ask here:\n\nHow are the hostel facilities? (rooms, food, WiFi, rules, etc.)\n\nIs it too strict?\n\nIs the food manageable?\n\nHow's the overall vibe for students?\n\nOr is it better to take a nearby PG for more freedom and better comfort?\n\nAny tips, suggestions, or personal experiences would really help me decide!",

Use VPN\n\nRules - Nothing strict is actively followed . Just return to the hostel before 10pm and don't do drugs , ull be fine.\n\nNah its not too strict , theres enough scope and loopholes to do pretty much everything\n\nThe food is great personally. There's 3 messes - South Indian , North Indian and mixed. You can definitely find one of the messes to your liking ( Food Court is my preferred mess )\n\nOverall vibe is honestly decent. We have our fair share of fun during events like new year , ipls , finals' , etc etc\n\nPGs can be slightly inconvenient but they do definitely offer freedom."

The crowd is decent but it’s mostly on luck who you find immediately but you’ll settle down sooner or later. Objectively PG is a better option but I personally like it here"
