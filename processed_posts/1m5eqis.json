(Cse at ec campus) but I heard that for first-year students in PES EC campus in amaatra hostel we have to wake up as early as 6:30 and the return timings I don't know(what is the travelling time from hostel to college?)the curfew at hostel is 7pm\nthe 4 sharing rooms have bunker beds are there no 2 or 3 sharing rooms?? \nsuggest some pgs near the college that cut down the travelling time...(not likely to join pg because my parents won't send me to pg)\n\n2..cse(ai ml) at rr campus........  I heard it's very crowded at RR campus and getting the merit scholarship is harder(btw i need to get scholarship). Is it so crowded that even getting lunch is difficult?(I know competition is good but it's too much)",
