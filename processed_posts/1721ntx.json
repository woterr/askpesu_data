I would like to say, understand your usage. macs are usually overhyped, but only people who know to make the best out of it, will benefit. \n\nThere are few advantages and disadvantages.. (you google about this)\n\nThere were some issues that I faced,\n\neg: some softwares dont run on mac, you would need a windows. \n\nIf you are looking for a laptop, choose a 16gb ram and anything above 256gb ssd. Macs usually run for a min of 5 years, which is really great compared to windows. \n\nIf you are getting mac on discount, at the price range of 50-70k,  its a good deal."

Used Windows through my UG in Bangalore, and saw some of my classmates face the Mac issue, and the professors wouldn't care.

      "body": "I am a second year student and use an M1 Macbook air, the base model of 8 256. \n\nYour biggest bottle neck will be storage. The RAM is manageable and enough on MacOS. If you're able to stretch your budget, get the 512 GB variant and not the 256 GB one.\n\nHere are my thoughts: \n\n1.  Most people install linux and a subject in the higher semesters afaik require you to be on linux. This isn't possible yet with the Apple Silicon Macbooks. Support is improving with the Asahi Linux Project but it's not perfect.\n2. You'd be better off getting a windows laptop. It's more freedom and you can install linux on it. Linux is an important part of having fun as a developer. \n3. The battery life on the Air is amazing. _amazing_ I can't emphasise that enough. This is one of the only pros I found on this laptop. \n4. You wouldn't be worried about the screen size a lot. It's actually an advantage if you have a smaller laptop. You'd be moving around a lot in college. Having a light bag is important, which leads me to my next point-\n5. Do not buy gaming laptops. They have terrible battery life and often come with compromises in build quality. Prefer having metal builds if your budget allows it. \n6. Do not go overboard on performance, balance other aspects like battery, screen, camera, evenly. Extra emphasis on battery. It's a hassle to be connected to the wall always. Anything with an intel i5 12th gen or above will be sufficient.\n7. Finally, try getting Intel EVO certified laptops. They offer great battery life and a superior experience generally. If I could go back in time when I was in my first year, I'd buy the [Acer Swift 3](https://www.amazon.in/Acer-Processor-Keyboard-Fingerprint-SF314-512/dp/B0B1F21WVP?th=1) (look for a better configuration if your budget allows for it, this is just a quick link I found on amazon)"

I think starting in this part is a pain, but as you grow you master it and it becomes a trivial thing. \n\nHaving a windows gives more flexibility in terms of experience (using Linux systems like Ubuntu, Kali etc.. recalling these from my college days). Growing up, the focus is more on experimentation, fast execution of plans and fun as well (install cracked games on windows). \n\nNot all college provides the licenses, like youâ€™ll need to worry about Microsoft office in Mac, not sure if thereâ€™s a free version of it in Mac. \n\nAs a beginner in CSE, I think it makes sense to go through some pain (reads as hard time understanding low level stuff to be able to perform some task without being a script kiddie) to understand about systems better."
