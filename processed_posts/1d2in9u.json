If you really want to do something, check out MIT's Missing Semester and Harvard CS50. Also its too soon to even think about a Masters now, so its best to focus on undergrad. Things like how to prepare and what are needed are very subjective and depend on your plans and field of interest, which you probably have no idea about until you get to at least second year."
