If we take 60/2 = 30 in end sems, 37/2 = 18.5 , adding the two we get 48.5 (Rounded off to 50) this got me B grade. \n\nAccording to the official grading scheme  S is >90, A is 80-90 , B is 70-80.\n\nNow when batch underperforms, the grading scheme is reduced \n\nnow S will be 70+ , A for 60-70, B for 50-60"
