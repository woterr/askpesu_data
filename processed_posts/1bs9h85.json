      "body": "You will lose access to it but there is no known time as such. You are randomly revoked access and one day you will see that you are no longer able to log into it because it has been deactivated. I would suggest keeping periodic backups of the data on that account after you graduate (or better, stop using it) so that you do not lose out on valuable data."
