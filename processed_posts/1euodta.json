The peer group at Nit meghalaya would be significantly worse than pes due to the hs quota and the cutoffs go north of the 2 lakh mark"

Donâ€™t worry about missing out on another branch in NIT; this program is comparable to the top NIT CSE courses. If youâ€™re among the top 100 students, you could secure a package of 30 LPA or more. After 2 to 3 years of experience, your skills will matter more than the college you attended. Some people might comment, \"Oh, youâ€™re from NIT,\" but if you donâ€™t land a good placement, the same people might say you got into NIT by luck. Focus on your studies instead of the college name. PES University is an excellent choice for CSE. Donâ€™t regret itâ€”focus on your studies."

It's up to you, how you build your resume and portfolio of projects and skills. \n\nI always believe looking at a college's placement stats is absolutely useless. If you're good you'll get placed regardless. \n\nFrom your post it comes across as though you aren't looking for advice but more so for sympathy when really there isn't any need for it. \nNIT Meghalaya at the end of the day is in Meghalaya. PES is in an excellent part of Bangalore, you are only just starting your college life and so you may feel that the supposed prestige of an NIT is more important to you. \n\nBut I can guarantee that your college life will be very different from your expectations and you may even change your future goals radically as you get exposed to newer fields and technologies. \n\nKeep an open mind. PES offers a very up to date curriculum, exposure to the top companies and many alumni of PES are pursuing their Masters or MBAs in top universities across the world. \n\nIn short, stop whining, your life is only getting started, focus on making it what you want it to be. Remember you decide your outcome not the college. PES allows you to be academically focused while also having some kind of a social life (which you'll soon realise is extremely important).\n\n\nBeing in Bangalore is also an added advantage as all companies are located here, the move from Engineering to a job won't be as dramatic."
