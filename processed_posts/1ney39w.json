  "content": "So I have been attending classes past two weeks in PESU ec campus and I went in through jee mains. Now I have got a seat through kcet so I will switch the quota to it.  \nMy question to people who have done this is, that my section wonâ€™t change right? I could continue in my section and not have to go to a new kcet section?",
