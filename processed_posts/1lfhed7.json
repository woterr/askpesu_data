      "body": "Among the ones you have mentioned only chairperson seems to be a good option. But the only disadvantage you will have is you have to work on nlp or cv only as she prefers mostly nlp projects. Priyanka mam is capstone coordinator, she is new to the campus, so she doesn't have much experience. Preeti p is also ok, but not a recommended option. Ashwini mam is not so good if you are looking for ml projects. You can also look for badri Sir, surabhi mam, sujatha mam, preet mam and shylaja mam for ml.\nPreet mam can also be good for cybersecurity."
