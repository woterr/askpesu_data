  "title": "\"Am I screwed?\" and other timeless hits of the PESU subreddit : 2024 closing thoughts",
  "content": "Over the past year, I’ve noticed a recurring trend on this subreddit. Whether exams are around the corner or results are out, the same age-old questions flood this space. Behold the classics:  \n\n1. *\"I scored X marks in subject Y. Is there still hope for me?\"*  \n2. *\"This subject feels impossible—how do I study for it?\"*  \n3. *\"Seniors, how do I achieve a good CGPA?\"*  \n4. *\"How many marks do I need for a 9+ GPA in ISA?\"*  \n\nWhile these concerns reflect genuine anxiety, it’s hard to ignore the sheer repetitiveness of these posts. With a **search bar** readily available, why does no one think to use it? Instead of digging through years of similar questions and answers, the default approach seems to be: *“Let’s demand real-time validation from seniors!”*  \n\n---\n\n## The Search for Reassurance  \n\nLet’s be honest: most of these posts aren’t about seeking actionable advice. They’re about wanting reassurance. You’re hoping for comments like:  \n- *\"Don’t worry, bro, just study—it’ll all work out!\"*  \n- *\"Still time, champ! You’ve got this!\"*  \n\nHere’s the hard truth: no amount of \"You can do it!\" comments will magically fix your grades or study habits. If you want a good GPA, the only path forward is straightforward: **study what you can with the resources you have.**  \n\nTake the GPA-related posts as an example. Is it genuinely impossible for you to figure out how it’s calculated? It’s explained at the start of every semester, and a step by step guise is pinned in the FAQ's. GPA isn’t determined by your ISA marks alone—it’s the sum of all assessments. With basic math and the info provided, you can estimate this yourself. Flooding the subreddit with these questions only reinforces a lack of initiative.  \n\n---\n\n## Yes, PESU Is Flawed  \n\nLet’s address the elephant in the room: PESU’s academic system isn’t perfect. Professors often teach poorly, exams are frequently off-syllabus, and the marking system feels arbitrary. All of this is true. But complaining here won’t change anything. You still need to play the cards you’re dealt.  \n\nInstead of wallowing in the unfairness, focus on what’s in your control. Study what you can, and leave the rest to the system. This doesn’t mean accepting everything passively—it means picking your battles wisely. If an exam was genuinely unfair, that’s on the system, not on you. Don’t let it consume your energy or define your personality for weeks.  \n\n---\n\n## The Entrance Exam Hangover  \n\nA bigger issue is how many of you remain trapped in the *entrance exam mindset*. You’ve been conditioned to think life is just a series of tests, where every mark defines your worth. Newsflash: it doesn’t.  \n\nYou’ve spent years prepping for exams like JEE, cramming formulas and techniques to ace one big test. Now, you’re here—still stuck in that mindset. Every semester is treated like JEE 2.0, as if your CGPA or the number of Leetcode problems solved will determine your future.  \n\nHere’s a sobering truth: those entrance exams were a colossal waste of time. They didn’t teach you how to think, adapt, or solve real-world problems. They taught you to game a system, and now you’re left scrambling to build actual skills.  \n\n---\n\n## Breaking the Cycle  \n\nEvery junior I meet sounds like they’ve been produced by the same factory:  \n- *\"How many DSA problems should I solve to crack FAANG?\"*  \n- *\"Should I grind Leetcode or focus on projects for MS?\"*  \n\nThis obsessive focus on arbitrary metrics blinds you to the bigger picture. By the end of these four years, many of you will find yourselves in the same spots as peers from other colleges, regardless of entrance exam ranks. PESU grads and students from NITs or IITs often end up in the same MS programs or similar job roles.  \n\nWhat truly matters isn’t your CGPA or coding streak. It’s your ability to **learn, adapt, and communicate.** Companies don’t care if you’ve solved 500 Leetcode problems; they care if you can explain your ideas clearly and work effectively in a team.  \n\n---\n\n## The Myth of Senior Advice  \n\nSeniors don’t have a secret formula for success. Their advice boils down to:  \n1. Use the resources available.  \n2. Stay consistent with your efforts.  \n3. Be adaptable and resilient.  \n\nIf you’re looking for shortcuts or magical strategies, you’re wasting your time. Success isn’t about ticking off checkboxes; it’s about growing through the challenges.  \n\n---\n\n## For the Subreddit  \n\nIf you absolutely must ask for advice, at least make it worthwhile.  \n- **Use the FAQs:** They’re pinned for a reason.  \n- **Search before you post:** Most of your questions have already been answered.  \n- **Be specific:** Instead of generic queries, outline your challenges and what you’ve tried so far.  \n\n---\n\n## Looking Ahead  \n\nEvery Indian education subreddit—whether it’s PESU, DevelopersIndia, or similar forums—is riddled with doomscrolling, self-pity, and repetitive questions. This cycle isn’t helping anyone.  \n\nYes, there will be moments when you feel lost or overwhelmed. That’s natural. But instead of fixating on what you can’t control, focus on what you can do: put in the work, seek meaningful advice, and move forward.  \n\nBy 2025, let’s aim for fewer pity posts and more actionable discussions. Let’s shift from *\"Am I screwed?\"* to *\"Here’s how I’m tackling this problem—what do you think?\"*  \n\nBest of luck, PESU. Trust me, you’ll need it. But more importantly, you’ve got this. Or at least, I hope you do.",
