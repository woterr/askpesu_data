You need to be quick at solving because they always make the paper long and many people struggle to finish it.\n\nPython- 4 markers will generally be writing codes. Read slides and notes for theory.\n\nChem- everything comes directly fron slides. Just read those and go. You'll definitely get at least 2 numerical problems.\n\nMechanics- 4 markers come copy pasted from the textbook. They don't even change values. Mcqs is fully theory.\n\nEpd- I don't remember sorryðŸ’€. Everything was from slides only i think."

But if you want just look at the textbook and solve the questions that look easy. They usually ask easy numericals in isa and the harder ones in esa."
