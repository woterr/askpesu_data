For us all questions were mcqs. The marks you score in matlab will be added to the math assignment marks so do well in it.\nThe chem lab exam was pretty chill we didn't have to conduct the experiment at all! we just had to write down the procedure, graphs etc and chem sketch part you do on your own laptop soo.. it won't be hard!"
