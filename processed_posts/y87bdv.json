On r/Btechtards, most of them are from the north, so most of their opinions biased towards what they read on the internet. A 2ndary campus isn't always the same as the main campus. Look at dsce and dsatm,rvce and rvitm, BMSCE abd BMSIT; totally different. \n\nEven median salary for the 2 PES campuses vary. Most of the ppl who go to pes ec campus go there through PESSAT, which only 20k ppl wrote this year. I know a guy who got 18k in kcet, got 2k in PESSAT, so don't expect the peer group to be better at EC campus than BMS. \n\nSo, make an informed decision based on what you see for yourself."

The rest of your points are fine, even though it kind of sounds like pesu is paying you to say this. Kcet mock allo results are out and bms ise is at 1.3k whereas pes ec campus cse is at 3.5k, so most people are not convinced."

CSE  and ISE are the same thing. So don't worry about that. Getting ISE is as good as CSE. \nPES EC is a subsidiary campus. I got to know from a cousin  who passed out this year from PES that there is a huge difference between RR Campus and EC Campus even though PES people claim that they are the same. Even though they say placements are combined RR Campus students are given much more priority.  For every 10 RR students placed only 1 EC guy gets placed. There is a huge difference in average/median package of RR and EC.\nMaybe BMS is not as good as PES RR Campus but it is anyday better than EC Campus.\nMuch more chilled out. Lesser Intake, More Club Activities and Extra Curricular and Decent Placements(better placements than EC Campus Students anyday). Brand and Alumni of BMS is better than PES EC.\nI agree that PES RR Campus is better then BMS in Placements."
