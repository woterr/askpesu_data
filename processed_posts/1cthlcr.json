Everything till now is easy af and there isn't much stress at all. Easy 9+ gpa and get back 1 lakh a sem in scholarships \n\nEven first year at bits is quite hard, I've seen my brother's mechanics syllabus and it's insane what they make you do. My friend who got a seat there is struggling with a sub 7 gpa. Granted he doesn't study much, he does what i do. \n\nSo basically what I'm trying to say is that maybe it's advantageous to be in the top at a lower college than at the bottom of a better college. If you barely made it in, chances are that most people are smarter\n\nAnd most people who take electronics shift to computers anyways, if you're personally not interested in either i think you should pick the path which gives you better opportunities. Atm that's computers"
