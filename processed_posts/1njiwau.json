Increasing the number of women being hired is the only way to balance the ratio, when historically it's always been men who have gotten hired. How else would you balance a ratio which is skewed? Fire the men lmao? That's a lawsuit. \n\nDiversity hiring definitely exists. And for a very good reason, and it's here to stay. And as a man, it's something I will 100% support. If you think it's not required, it's simply because you and everyone else in our generation simply didn't experience any bias against us based on our gender, unlike the generations before us. So no, demanding equal opportunities now doesn't actually make things equal, since it doesn't actually fix the mistakes made earlier. \n\nHowever, having said that, it's wrong that sometimes, companies make it obvious, sometimes, it's hidden from us. And that's where I agree with you that companies need to be more honest and upfront about this, since it wastes time/energy/resources of both parties. \n\nDiversity hiring is a good thing. It's not a \"garbage clown world\" move. If this feels like an inconvenience for you, you're just getting to feel how women felt years ago."

I'm not going to respond to any more comments to this, at least from you, cause you are clearly not a human worth my time and effort.\n\n\\---\n\n  \nSTEM fields have been male-dominated for decades, not because men are inherently better (which you wildly and blatantly assume), but because systemic barriers made it harder for women (and other groups) to get the same opportunities: networking, mentorship, hiring, promotions, etc. Diversity hiring isn‚Äôt about hiring \"unqualified\" people, but rather, it‚Äôs about ensuring qualified candidates from all *backgrounds* have a fair shot, and fixing decades of systemic bias. Women have historically been denied these opportunities, and ignoring that history doesn‚Äôt make the field fair; it preserves inequality without a solution.\n\nWhen a company prioritizes diversity, they are usually still hiring highly competent people *within* that group (or at least that is the aim; I am going to ignore the cheating problem here since it's not relevant to our discussion). Diverse teams are better because different perspectives spark innovation, challenge existing assumptions, prevent groupthink, and improve problem-solving. They create more user-friendly, inclusive products and make better decisions overall. All of these help the company way more than you think. \n\nAlso, calling me a ‚Äúcuck‚Äù for supporting women getting fair opportunities is pathetic. Supporting fairness, correcting unfir bias, and recognizing competence isn‚Äôt weakness, it‚Äôs called having principles and common sense. Throwing insults doesn‚Äôt make your argument stronger; it just exposes how entitled and insecure you are about the topic. The fact that you see it as some kind of threat shows exactly why diversity hiring is needed. Despite you claiming that you want the better person to be hired, you lose your cool when a man actually backs equality. This is the kind of bias and stereotype that diversity hiring aims to fix.\n\nIf you feel this is unfair, congratulations, buddy! You‚Äôre now getting a tiny taste of what women have been dealing with for decades. And seriously, do better. I hope nobody looks up to you as a mentor, because no matter how skilled you are at LC or your job, you‚Äôre a complete garbage human being. Complain about diversity hiring all you want, but it exists precisely because of people like you in the past: entitled, self-absorbed, and oblivious, who made it necessary in the first place."

At your actual workplace, this diversity based promotion is even worse, and you will get to see how women use this to their advantage. What this also does is it allows other women in the company to not put in their 100% as they still know they will be promoted just to meet the quota. Go to any organization and ask the guys who work there, and I can bet you that almost 80% of them would have been screwed by this diversity in some way or the other. I don't even understand some of these comments justifying it by telling that you need different views etc and that is why this is done. When plane's, cars, rockets were built, no one wanted these different views, but all they wanted was talented engineers. What needs to be done is to have policies in the organization where discrimination is not allowed. But they won't do that and do diversity based hiring or promotions as that is just easy PR for the companies now.
