If you dont have 75% attendance also, the week before your ESA, you can sit in your class to cover up. Go to cafeteria, gjbc or go and play basketball in the parking lot. Go and camp outside the Registrar's office, and they still wont give a shit. Just make sure your HOD doesnt see you. They are usually the only ones who give a shit."
