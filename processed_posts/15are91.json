      "body": "If your goal is to get a job through placements, biotech is the worst choice. For this year, only 6 biotech students got placed. 5 in T3 jobs and 1 in T2 job. There were 0 tier 1 offers. If yoi have a passion for biotechnology, I'm sure there are better colleges like Manipal. But if you just wanna do your degree and go for higher studies you can consider it"

My brother decided to go the US for higher studies and is leaving tomorrow he's also changing his course too. I'd say if keep PES lower down on your preference list. The subject itself isn't that good in india unless you're ok with going with higher studies later with all the costs or changing course later"
