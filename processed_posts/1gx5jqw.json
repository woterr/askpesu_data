What made the course 10x worse is that our TOC (now called AFLL) course (which back then was in 4th sem, not 3rd) was cancelled halfway because of COVID. So all of us went into compiler design without knowing the basics lmao. \n\nI still have PTSD from that course even now. I've got an Interpreter Design course for my Master's this semester and every class reminds me of the shit I went through 3 years ago and the assignments give me sleepless nights üò≠"
