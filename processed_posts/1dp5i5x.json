Also, if our grades increase how much will we get refunded? \n\nOur ESA results came out and I am confident that I should've got better grades in atleast 2 subjects but a bit hesitant on applying considering the Rs 1000 or so they charge per subject and can't go for paper review also now as I went back to my hometown. \n\n",
