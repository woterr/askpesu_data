  "content": "I am changing my branch in 3rd sem. The counselling is on 14th. We will be 2 weeks behind from other students. I have a few doubts.\n\n1. Do the classes start from scratch?\n\n2. How are the new sections decided?\n\n3. Is the attendance shifted to other branch coz I am attending most of my current classes.",
