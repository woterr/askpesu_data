  "content": "\n\nI'm in my 4th sem and some of my friends are already forming “unofficial” capstone teams and ass kissing potential mentors. No idea why this early, but whatever.\n\nHow do people form teams? Do you just stick with your friends, or if that’s not an option, do you just look for anyone who meets the criteria? And does gender and cgpa diversity actually matter or is that just some formality? I’m a female with a cgpa in the 8–9 range, can I just be in a team with all girls. Most of my friends are girls, and most of us fall in the same gpa range. I’ve done projects with some of them and know they’re decent enough when it comes to getting work done.\n\nAlso, how do you pick a mentor? I’ve heard bad stories about mentors being extremely nasty and generally unhelpful, so I’d like to know what to watch out for.\n\n",

There are at best a handful of good research advisors: ones who actually care about you and the work you do, are not only experienced/knowledgeable in their field but are passionate about research in it, have quality research publications and a track record of helping their students get a good paper, are known to stand up for students and actively help out by almost being a 5th teammate etc. \n\nThese are often the top picks for most capstone teams and they include bigshot names like Gowri, KSS, BJD etc. These are profs who do a fantastic job at guiding and mentoring teams and if you're working with such a guide, getting a great paper (provided you also show interest and effort from your end) is almost guaranteed. Also, this leads to them also giving significantly better and standout LORs for MS applications. \n\nPeople start approaching these profs almost a semester early and that's the ideal timeline to approach them. When registrations officially begin, all these profs will already be booked out. So the *only* way to get them is to approach them extremely early and keep in touch with them over the course of the previous semester. So yes, what your friends are doing is actually right. \n\nYou should pick teammates whose interests align with yours and are willing to work towards the same research goals. Also, ensure they're as serious about capstone as you. Unless all of you care the same about this research project and have the same shared research interests and goals, it'll be very difficult to find a common problem statement. Since this is basically a 1.5+ year long endeavour, unless you're extremely passionate about what you're doing, you're going to lose interest quickly. Once that happens, your grades will dip. So before you go pick your friends, first ask yourself if their interests align with yours. As much as picking friends is easy, it mostly doesn't work out (worked out for me and I was lucky). At the end of the day, put the project and yourself first. Reach out to people in the batch and find people with shared interests, relevant experience in what you're interested in and whether they have the relevant skills to pull it off. You'll eventually get along and become friends as you work together. \n\nWe did not have strict diversity criteria so maybe someone else can comment on it. Should be okay to choose whoever you want. But pick wisely. Sometimes choosing people you know best isn't the best approach. \n\nIf you don't have a team, you get randomly assigned as far as I know."

Some of my friends wanted me in their team just because we’re friends, but they have no idea what they’re doing or even a domain in mind. I’m honestly still figuring things out myself. A lot of seniors I’ve spoken to are miserable in their teams, so at this point, if I can't find a decent mentor (which is likely given the quality of professors here), the least I could do is  have good teammates."

Once you do that, you can ask seniors for suggestions and/or ask around on discord/reddit. Dw, its pretty easy to find out who is good and who isn't, but you're going to have some form of direction first.\n\n>I’m honestly just as clueless and still figuring things out myself\n\nThat's ok, you have time. But you're going to have to double down your efforts and start looking into it soon. Explore and see what interests you and spend some time on whether you want to work on a 2-year long project on it. You're approaching your 3rd year now - you should have begun developing *some* form of affinity towards certain fields, if not specialising in something. If you haven't, then you are a bit behind, but you can always catch up! This is something you need not only for capstone but also placements and your future career. Reach out to seniors/alumni for help if you need any. There are multiple just a text away who are ready to help.\n\n>A lot of seniors I’ve spoken to are miserable in their teams, so at this point, if I can't find a decent mentor (which is likely given the quality of professors here), the least I could do is have good teammates.\n\nI guess this is an understandable conclusion to get to, however, you don't need to always pick friends to have \"good\" teammates. If you check out discord/reddit, you will find multiple posts complaining about capstone teammates and how there is a disparity in the effort being put in and seriousness about the entire project. In almost all of these posts, its a group of friends working together. One thing that also comes with friendship is the loose boundary between members when working on projects, which *can* lead to lack of accountability, responsibility, slacking off and the general \"they're a friend, its ok they will understand if I don't put in the work now\". Make sure the friends you pick to form a team with are as serious about the project as you and encourage others in the team to also put in the effort. Otherwise, you are going to end up struggling to get them to do work. I am not saying this *will* happen, but this is one of the most common problems to occur with teams formed among friends."

They just assign the remaining randomly since the ones remaining usually don't have any specific goals. Which is why if you *do* have an idea/goal, do not let it get to this stage."
