      "body": "Multiple, all in our favour:\n\n1. Since there are few holidays during the year, you get a large contiguous 2.5 month summer break. No other college gives such a long break during summer. People travel, pursue internships or even take time off during this long break. You can do a LOT with 2.5 months.\n\n2. Back during COVID, PES was the only college to not be affected by delays or changes to its schedule because it kept offline exams. We started our placement cycle on time and everyone got placed as per usual timelines. Other colleges weren't as fortunate, some lagged by an entire semester behind us and their placements got delayed. Additionally, because we were able to finish 3rd year on time, it gave people those few weeks before final year (and placement season began) to actually prepare (albeit last minute) for placements. \n\n3. You'll never have classes on Saturdays (unless in exceptional cases) and the syllabus will for the most part always be completed before the ESAs. You'll never need any compensatory classes on weekends or otherwise to finish portions."
