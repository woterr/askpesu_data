As per college, they say that since college has indirectly played a role for that PPO, rejecting it is equivalent to rejecting a direct offer from that tier through placements.\n\nI got a PPO from my company where I did my summer, but the package was tier 2 and the clg had some bs clause which said I cant sit for entire tier 1. So i rejected the PPO and sat for placements in tier 1, but they have told that I cant sit for tier 2 anymore"
