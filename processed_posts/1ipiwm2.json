  "content": "Hey all, my friends brother wants to join PES but is unsure of which branch to pick among AI & ML and CSE. As a CSE grad before the AIML course was introduced, I donâ€™t have an idea on how the AI ML course in PES is. \n\nAny feedbacks? When should he pick AIML over CSE or CSE over AIML?",

      "body": "See , AIML is a good branch and will definitely have similar scope to CSE because the syllabus here is nice , but companies and some foreign unis ( for masters ) , don't always prefer a specialization during undergrad ( there may be very specific companies that come for those , which is fine if you're very interested in only that field , but u'll end up restricting urself ). Moreover , you can take AIML electives as a CSE core student later on too , but you can't do the same with AIML branch.\n\nSo I'd recommend picking AIML only if he doesen't get CSE core or if he's genuinely interested in the AIML field ( which is very mathematical and in a way research-oriented by the way )"

You're not going to be utilising the \"scope\" of ai better by taking one additional course that doesn't have jack shit."
