  "content": "Basically the title, I've recently heard from my batchmates that they're gonna give some credits in doing internship after 2nd year or taking some special topic course in college in summer term. How are they gonna give credits to people who don't land at any internship and doesn't take any summer courses. \nAlso, if I get an unpaid internship will they consider it to give credit? ",
