      "body": "Hey, see I will be real with you. Listen to class proper and chill after college everyday! No need to make notes etc, just listen and understand what they are teaching. 1 week before ISA/ESA start the prep and my priority was always Slides. Be really really good with slides, like go through each page in the slides properly and in depth that's it. I have gotten 10 SGPA only using slides!! One more tip - Study for ISA same as ESA. For example for ISA 1 you will have unit 1 and 2 (Study for ISA like ESA like you are preparing for subjective exam). This makes ESA very easy as you have already covered all 4 units and you have to just revise again. Also i like to keep writing notes/Scribbling my notebook when i read slides (like important points helps me to remember things properly)"
