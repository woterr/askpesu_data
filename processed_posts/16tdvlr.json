  "content": "Hi, I have a question for the freshers in the B.tech program(CSE). How are classes going on, and how much are you guys enjoying it, and the campus environment? \n\nIs it good, are you feeling a bit overwhelmed? How's the college life since PESU is committing to a 3 ISA system? Is it a bit lenient or is it as strict as before? \n\nI wish some seniors would comment on it, and share their experiences and opinions on their college life, so that the freshers may get an idea on how they will be spending 4 years in EC Campus. \n\nThank you.",
