Did not attend the 1st round due to advanced exam (and in person counselling) and want to participate in 2nd round. Are there any vacancies in CSE or AIML?. Or the vancancies are only for ECE?. If any one has info, pls share it so that i can book tickets and prepare DDs. Need to travel from Delhi.",
