  "content": "I attended the seminar for joining hostel and damnðŸ’€, they said there's something called DW (deviation weightage) for eg: 10 DW if your clothes are out in the open untidy\n\nThey said if one reached DW of 100 points, they shall be removed from the hostel ,and many more ridiculous rules like be in hostel before 7:30 PM and not allowed to go to friends room after 9:00 PM\n\nHell they even said they'd check all the phones and laptops frequently ðŸ’€, for gambling and etc ofc but still \n\nThere were almost 40 rules including \n\n-Not allowed to go on trips or picnics with friends \n\n-Have to get some book signed every time you go to your parents or local guardian's house\n\n-If your room mate was into wrong things like gambling, cigarette, alcohol,drugs etc and you didn't report any of it, you'll have to bear consequences too\n\n\n\nAre these real? Can anyone confirm this?",
