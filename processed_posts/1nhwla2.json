  "content": "There wasn’t much info in the mail, and I couldn’t find anything online either, so I’m hoping any seniors who’ve gone through the process can share their experience.\n\n* What was the **Online Assessment (OA)** format? Was it a **CTF-style** challenge, or the usual **DSA + MCQ** based test?\n* How many rounds were there, and what were they like?\n* What kind of questions were asked in the **technical** and **HR** interviews?\n\nAny input from those who’ve appeared for this would be greatly appreciated even brief pointers or tips would help a lot.\n\nThanks in advance to anyone willing to help!",
