But unless there is some amount of determination 'n' smart-work from your side, it will be difficult.   \nSo, just read the following according to me-\n\n1. Textbook - Mainly Arthur Beiser Book\n2. Slides and Notes (optional) \\[FYI, I really didn't like the slides much\\]\n3. Assignments & QB In PESU Academy \\[If you've got time left yet\\]"
