Unless you join through the later stages of cet and you'll not be in alphabetical order as these are in the last few sections (seriously 12 sections is a lot). Otherwise if your class is a mix of students from different branches, the ones belonging to the same branch will remain to do so and the gaps will be filled by shifting from previous/next sections in alphabetical order (approximately 60-65 in one section)"
