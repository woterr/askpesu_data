      "body": "With the current revision in coursework, only your electives will differ (and if you choose to take electives from AIML - you can take them from CS too now). You totally need to take 4 electives, so that's 4*4 credits each / 160 credits so roughly 10%. \n\nGetting >8 CGPA isn't \"tough\" but you're not going to get it without at least the minimum preparation."

      "body": "According to the revised syllabus,cse(aiml) has the same syllabus as core Cse in 2nd,andd 3rd year,and even in 3rd year ,cse(aiml) students can take the exact same electives as cse students,if they take cybersec for example.What I mean to say is that its not completely fixed that we need to take atleast 1 aiml elective. Do you think the degree would still be an issue while applying for masters in Cs abroad?"
