Above 8 is like good and Above 9 is god-like.\n\nSo in the coming semesters just focus and try scoring well (above 7 at least). I would say, focus more on yourself and start acquiring skills that will help your career line.\n\nCollege is just here for you to explore and get some graduation certificates. Everything else you need to do on your own\n\nGood Luck Man!!"
