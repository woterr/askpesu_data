Butt into your personal life? You wouldn't like it then would you? It's funny how the same people complain when there are rules to avoid these situations..."

Nobody should be in a situation where they feel like there's no other way out. The college hasn't even officially acknowledged these deaths or changed any of their policies or methods. There's so much unnecessary stuff that goes on in our college like the bouncers cracking down on us like we're criminals. In one of his addresses the VC literally said that he doesn't care about the students, he just cares about how the college is ranked. If you're expecting PES management to care about us, you're gonna be very disappointed. All we can do is look out for our friends and help them out when they're in a bad spot mentally"
