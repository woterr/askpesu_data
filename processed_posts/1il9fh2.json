The third unit is where you have to study a considerable amount of theory and solve quite a few numericals too. The numericals in the fourth unit are fairly easy but it is heavily theoretical. Me personally, I had to slog through notes and slides for the theoretical stuff.\n\nMechanical was the hardest for me partly because of a mid teacher so I had to slog through 936 slides before ESA."
