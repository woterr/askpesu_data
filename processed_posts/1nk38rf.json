In this college nothing is feeling good you ruined my life ðŸ˜­"

There are good sides and bad sides to this place, just like at any other college. The bad sides tend to be more pronounced on reddit because nobody gives it credit publicly. There are a few things that PES actually does pretty great at compared to other colleges, and many students and alumni like me have realised this only after graduating and comparing ourselves with peers from other colleges. And tbf, you're still better off at PES than those other colleges, except maybe Thapar but as far as I know they're equivalent. \n\nI've never told anyone to pick PES (or not pick) over any college. I've always provided all the information and asked you to make an informed choice."
