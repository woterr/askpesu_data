You could watch that.\n\nBut if you want to learn in a more systematic manner , I suggest you go to neetcode.io website , in that , go to roadmap , there you have everything mapped out very very well. You can start from there. You'll figure it out how to start yourself.\n\nWish someone taught me this when I was in my 3rd year."

No matter what company or job role you apply to , it could be frontend development , backend development, data science jobs , devops job , anything , you'll need DSA because every company shortlists students based on DSA (which is always the first round in an interview).\n\nAs for freelancing , web development is super helpful. If you learn full stack (both front end and backend) , you can take small projects on sites like fiverr"
