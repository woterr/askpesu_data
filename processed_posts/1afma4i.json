EPD make sure to make notes in class cause teachers give comprehensive notes.\n\n For chem slides and notes from pesuacademy are good and enough.\n\n Mechanics you literally just need the tb and it's solutions you won't ever touch the slides and pesuacademy videos are trash for mechanics so pay attention in class, for theory there's a combined pdf with all the theory parts of the textbook."
