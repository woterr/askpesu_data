      "body": "Assuming both are through CET, PES has slightly better placements, a much better crowd and a stronger academic focus. If you're focused on building the foundation of your career and not a party person, then PES is the right choice here. Ofc it comes with an average college life, but as I said, if you only care about the RoI and career opportunities, then PES is the way to go."
