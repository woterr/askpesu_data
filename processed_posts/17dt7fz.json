Start sending mails from your 4th semester beginning or the **gap b/w 3rd and 4th semester (if its there lmao)**\n\nBut you must have immense patience, as it will take a very long time for them to reply."

Don't expect too much cuz getting a internship before finishing 3rd year is quite rare. \n\n\nDon't worry too much about gpa unless it's really bad (below 6.75 and such). Make sure you have the skillset and knowledge (and some projects if you can) for the internship you want."
