They called me twice that the registration closes today..n..blah.blah.blah..they were somewhat forcing me to book a slot for interview. But I gave some reasons to escape. How come after reaching on this platform I'm hearing the negative aspects of this college, I mean in quora the answers seemed like \"paid\" One and I saw 2-3 YouTube videos where they were saying \"Why you should join PES for MCA \", best in Bengaluru etc. etc."

I hated every aspect of this place, starting from the fact that we don't get any sort of \".edu\" mail even though this is a university, to the fact that companies don't want to hire MCA when they come for placements. \n8/242 is the placement stats of the current year. \nJust join RV or some other college and do yourself a favour. \nMCA here is just a gimmick to get money for the university."
