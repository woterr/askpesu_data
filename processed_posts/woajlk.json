I'd like to know how true this is as hostel admissions cannot be done yet for management quota, kcet and jee quota as it requires an admission slip which only pessat people seemed to have recieved. I've gone to the campus before and spoken with the wardens and they told us that majority of the btech freshers will be in the nb block. What happens to the kcet, management, jee guys as they have not booked yet. Is this something to do with the hostels inefficiency or do they have a reserved number for pessat students or is this simply an excuse to have us in the briefing session",
