  "content": "I am a third year in hostel, and it is so weird how I still don't have any friends in this place, I do have friends in my class, or even outside my class, but when I just go back to my hostel? It sucks, no one asks me or takes me seriously, I have tried so many times and I am in a group in hostel, but I can always feel like I am just there because I got myself there, instead of anyone wanting me there, I could just focus in my studies and not care, but how am I supposed to when I see everyone else enjoying themselves in the group while I am always the outcast?\nIt is either kannadigas or north indians, and I am neither, I do not know what I should do to be liked or so that they even consider me as someone part of the group, I feel like I just tag along, they do not even listen half the time when I talk, while all my other friends in college go back home and have their groups too in their apartment.\nWill I always be a loner, or am I just a cry baby?",

      "body": "from what i have seen as a first year living in hostel, people have made groups in accordance to their language where they are comfortable, but its not like u can't enter those groups. Sure, some people from south talk more in their mother tongue and its difficult to make them revert back to english again and again. But u may enter north indian groups(if u know english or understand a little bit of hindi) coz ig they are more open to others. Like I being a part of 3-4 groups myself and 2 groups being like chuddy buddy friends, they are many people in our group who are from different places. Ig u just have to make that one gud friend who can introduce u to others but for that u need to open up and talk to lot of people randomnly. dm me, if any fresher wants to open up and make friends, as the friends u make in college will be the ones that last forever(my father used to say that). btw i m in rr campus hostel IT block."
