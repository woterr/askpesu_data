No educational institution has the right to politicise itself like this (Please don't quote me if I'm wrong). Literally placing campaign banners just as the elections are close by.\n A few questions:\n1) Can/Should we do anything about this?\n2) What are your opinions?\n3) Will first time voters be actually influenced by such embarrassing campaigning in Universities as reputed as ours?\n\nPic 1 and 2 are from the main gate\nPic 3 is in front of the student lounge by GJB\n\nP.S: Just want to say that this is not a political party problem, this is just not the right place in my opinion. You'd probably see a post like this from me if it were another party.",

No, when I joined, Foreign minister had visited our college.. and I was well aware of this uni backed by a political party.. \n\nAs a first time voter, I did my research and voted for the party that I felt would benefit my state.

But this mf, was adamant on us coming. So we had to call up NSUI, national students union India. These guys were the ones who were the voice of students in other parts of the state, mangalore. MYSURU etc. They planned a huge protest. There were mails sent, a scandalous reply from Jawahar also came, students were enraged. There was a protest planned,with the support of NSUI. NSUI guys areaffiliated with the Congress party. One day before the protest was planned, there was a meeting with the college officials and the NSUI. After the meeting the protest was cancelled. Apparently, the NSUI was threatened with consequences if they don't step back. That was the first time, when I realised the power of association with BJP the college has.\n\nDo not get into this mess. First of all you should stay away from PES.

But the problem comes in branch. If you're okay with studying civil engineering for 4 years which again involves physics and the same dogshit, you can choose that. Anyway most civil engineers learn coding in parallel and try to sit for IT placements. Focus on comedk for now. Try for RVCE. Even pes seems okay since the comparison is with the civil branch of NITK. I'm really not sure. You'll have to talk with a senior who has chosen civil in NITK. Talk to a civil engineering senior at NITK and enquire about their placements and how the coding atmosphere is in the lower branches of NITK."
