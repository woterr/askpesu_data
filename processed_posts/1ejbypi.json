      "body": "It depends on the person and the subject. Notes can be helpful for math (whatever the subject is) and AFLL.\n\nIf you can neatly write down the procedure to solve an AFLL question and make note of some questions, it can be helpful. So, try to make running notes during classes for SDS and AFLL. Not in detail, ignore theory. Just the procedures and some formulae that are not in slides would be sufficient.\n\nAs for subjects to focus on, it depends on what you find easy and hard. DSA is the most important subject. Spend a good amount of time on it, as it is helpful for placements. Try solving questions after you complete a concept.\n\nWeb Tech is also important. Spend a good amount of time on it, go beyond academics, and try things hands-on, as you'll have to make projects by yourself for your resume.\n\nSDS is easy. Just classwork questions and slides should be enough.\n\nAFLL is similar.\n\nDDCO can be a little tough. Study things from the text and solve textbook questions."
