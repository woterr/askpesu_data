  "content": "I'm a student of ISC board and my result was announced on 6th May.\n\nQuestions:\n1) When I try to search Google, it shows me the link to update PUC marks. According to my little knowledge, it is something equivalent to 11+12th in Karnataka. Is it valid for me to update 12th ISC boards result there?\n2) If I do update it there n upload marksheet, I have to also fill the \"Overall Aggregate Percentage\". Should I fill percentage of best 4 subjects(as calculated in ISC) or including all 5 subjects? \n\n",
