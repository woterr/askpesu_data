  "content": "Hey everyone,  \nI‚Äôm an AIML student just done with 1st year. Back during my PESSAT counselling, I had the option to choose between CSE and CSE-AIML. I picked AIML because I was interested in the AI/ML field.\n\nBut after joining college, I‚Äôve been hearing that the syllabus is almost the same, and that real AIML stuff doesn‚Äôt start until much later. One of my friends even suggested I should try to shift to core CSE if I get a chance ‚Äî said there‚Äôs uncertainty around AIML placements since the batch hasn‚Äôt been placed yet.\n\nNow I‚Äôm just confused ‚Äî feels like neither the AIML learning nor placement clarity is working out. üòì\n\nCould some AIML seniors (especially 3rd/4th years or anyone placed) please share your experience?\n\n* Is there really a disadvantage in terms of placements?\n* Does AIML get proper exposure later in the course?\n* What would you do in my place?\n\nAlso ‚Äî this might sound silly but I‚Äôm confused about one more thing:  \nShould AIML students‚Ä¶  \na) Follow the same path as CSE folks?  \nb) Try building their own direction in AI/ML (like doing more outside the syllabus)?  \nIf it's option b, would love to hear any roadmap, advice, or tips for how to go about it.\n\nThanks in advance üôè really appreciate any guidance from seniors. I'd love input from u/Sad_Ticket_8800  if you're around!",

      "body": "4th year AIML dude here.\n\nNo clue about placements yet, although internship offers during 3rd year were handed out almost proportionately to dept sizes.  \nComing to exposure, aka electives during 3rd year. They're good, but you can get a similar, if not better understanding of certain concepts if you just put in the time to learn whenever you can. The syllabus seems to be the exact same across departments until the 3rd year.  \nWhat really irks me is the fact that you're not given the choice of taking up some really good electives like the ones in the systems vertical (BD, HP, etc.). Those are much safer electives to be choosing as an undergrad. Realistically, you have much higher chances of getting an ML-related job right out of the gate after you've done a masters in this domain.\n\nThe choice is ultimately yours. Would personally just shift to CSE if I cleared the GPA requirement to do so. If not, you're still fine."
