I have registered for PESSAT but I am confused about what to study, what kind of questions are asked and how do I achieve a good rank? Honestly, I haven't don't too great in 11th and my 12 is also ok-ok. Any guidance for the exam will be helpful.\n\nThank you!",

If you are already preparing for JEE/BITSAT then there's no need for extra prep for this. It's usually a cakewalk for most people aiming higher. There are multiple posts every year on this topic, search this subreddit and you'll find more relevant posts with answers about the pattern and other details."

      "body": "The fees are extremely superfluous. 6 years ago, the fees for me was 3.2 and even then we considered it to be high. 4.8LPA is too high for a tier 2/3 University in Bangalore. Placements aren't the only thing that determine a college's quality and this is primarily their only strength, but even that isn't worth 4.8. I'd definitely recommend this place if you get in through CET, but PESSAT fees is too high. Look for other similarly ranked options instead."
