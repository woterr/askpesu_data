These are courses which you opt over the already existing 3 core subjects  \n\n> Are certain electives or teachers assigned according to cgpa or is there no such relation?\n\nNope, there is no such relation."

      "body": "Uhm no. If you are in CS, when there are multiple profs for a single elective, a form is sent out asking you your preference for profs taking a course. These are then allotted based on your CGPA, so the person with the highest CGPA gets first pick and so on. This might not be the case for ECE because of the lower batch strength but for CS electives like Big Data, Data Analytics etc, there has always been a priority list based on CGPA."
