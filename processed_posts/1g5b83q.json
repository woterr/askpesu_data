  "content": "Hey everyone. Whatâ€™s the current state of PES RR campus? 2020 CS grad here. \nItâ€™s been a (really) long time since I visited the campus (Donâ€™t have my ID card on me sadly) \nI was curious about things now post all the things that transpired earlier this year. \n\nWho all are the HODs and the _meta_ CS profs? \n\nI remember back in 2020 a lot of the good profs left PES and Iâ€™m not really sure of the ones that have remained in PES now. \n\nIs Chetanâ€™s juice store still open?\n\nIs Vasundhara Kritika still open? \nDo they still have people from the college there? (When we were about to graduate there was an entire scene with the VK association and not allowing PESU kids to take up residence there). \n\nAnd finally. Is the construction of that new building done?",
