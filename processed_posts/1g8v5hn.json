He does not know any programming and copy pasted answers from chatgpt. I have nothing against him but I feel bad because I thought I had the potential. \n\nAs there are less clubs recruiting now, I'm scared I won't get into a tech club. I really want to.",

The fact that a club even needs a selection process in the first place sounds dumb. What if I'm really passionate about films and am a film geek but I can't apply for the club just because I haven't actually made any short films by myself?"

Considering that I had already directed two short films I assumed that it would be easy but turns out you have to direct a one minute long campaign/advertisement. The campaign does sound relevant but if you asked me what would be a more relevant selection criteria, I would say that it is short films. Even if I decide to upload my short film in place of the campaign, I have to ensure that the file is under 10 mb, which is impossible.\n\nThe entire point of the clubs is to meet like-minded people and make good friends along the way but by not having a good selection criteria and process, you are demotivating who are definitely qualified for the clubs."

Life is unfair,luck plays a role, suck it up, move on, grow. \nOne advice to juniors is attend as many club interviews as possible. It will help you sell yourself and take rejections better if things go bad."

They even took my Github ID to see projects, I had one project in ML. And I still got rejected, simply because my knowledge wasn't as extensive and they felt that learning ML will be 'hard for me', In the group they said they didn't want technical answers and proceeded to ask technical questions where I gave partially technical answers almost to the point. Idk what their agenda was, but I did not get in. Don't break your head, focus on your own projects, they carry more value, and trust me, once u join a club u will be tasked to do all kinds of odd jobs u won't like. Take part in club events, and let them serve you instead of you serving them."
