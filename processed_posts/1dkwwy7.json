Coming to improving CGPA u only got 4 more SEMs to improve cuz after 6th sem placement season begins. If u are aiming to to get 9+ sgpa there’s no need to start early just focus on classes, clear the concepts in the class itself. Make ur own notes. Ik this is hard but trust me once u get used to it u will enjoy. \n\nAll the best !!"
