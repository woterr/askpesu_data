  "content": "I'm a final year student at PES University and I've recently been accepted into a college abroad for my post graduate. The semester starts in the first week of September and the visa processing time is 13 weeks approx. I need to apply soon for the visa so that I can receive it before the commencement of classes.\n\nI need my Provisional Degree Certificate in order to apply for the visa.  \nAfter how many days from our last ESA do we receive our PDC? Also, is there a way we can get it faster by paying some amount? My last ESA is on 23rd May. I've contacted the university regarding this but they don't seem to respond.  \n",
