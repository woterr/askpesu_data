      "body": "Although I agree with you, let me play devil's advocate: It costs a lot of money to offer student email accounts to everyone, especially if you're offering a lot of storage with it. This is a recurring cost for them every year, and since the number of students joining every year increases, it's a constantly almost exponentially increasing cost. Beyond a point, it becomes too much to handle. \n\nUnis will need to draw the line at some compromise. At my uni, we get 20 GB of storage on our uni email address. But it's lifetime access. So we get much less storage but it's always with us. The other compromise would've been to increase storage but have an expiry date. \n\nSo yes while I agree that PES should give students email addresses, they also need to find a way to handle the costs for it."

But like i know for a fact that in the admin panel of even the most basic acedmic (institution wide) subscription package(in office suite)...theres an option to add a domain other than the one that microsoft gives you as like a default setting up thing. I dont see why pes doesnt just create another subdomain cuz as far as i know, it costs them nothing extra."
