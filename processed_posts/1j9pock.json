Sure, yes, there were off days which were a bore and a pain to get through, days when I wished the logoff time couldn't come sooner and days when I didn't feel like working. But 95% of my time was very fruitful and gratifying because I was genuinely interested in what I worked on, had a great and supportive team and overall always looked forward to the next day.\n\nIf you feel like you are stagnating, then you need to reprioritise your goals, figure out what you like and what would make you get out of bed early everyday. Once you start looking forward to tomorrow, life gets much simpler and easier. If you are still in college, figure out what you want to do and why you aren't happy. Many times, it could be because you simply haven't set any goals for yourself or are not pursuing what you want to.\n\nTagging u/Altruistic_Mall_763 in this comment."

By the end of my college days, I was very specialised in my field, I applied very specifically to companies that had such roles, bagged an off campus research internship at a leading research lab and more. \n\nThe only thing I feel fortunate about is having the clarity and direction to do what I wanted pretty early.

Also agree with Indian work culture being mostly toxic. \n\nLuck isn't all you need. There has to be more accountability from your end, stop blaming factors that either don't exist or have marginal effects or you have no control over. One thing I've noticed in the current generation is that when life takes a sharp turn (academics, work etc), you all just let it happen and blame it on circumstances instead of actually pulling the steering wheel back in your hands. \n\n> if ur not lucky enough u will neither find whatever ur passionate about nor a good job. If finding your passion was so easy we would be living on pluto rn or something\n\nBaseless statement. Whose fault is it for not actively trying to find your niche? Lady Luck? Or you, who didn't/couldn't take out time during your schooling/college to explore and pursue different things? Stop making excuses about finding your interest being difficult. It's not difficult, but it can be time consuming - but the outcome is always worth it. You all need to have a much more accountable outlook in life. If you keep finding a scapegoat at every inconvenience, you're simply avoiding the problem. You can't say that you didn't find what you were interested in because you weren't \"lucky\". \n\nPeople don't find their interests by *chance*. They find it, refine it and cultivate it with effort and time. There are deterministic actions that lead to deterministic consequences. The system is as transparent as you make it. You don't put in the hard work -> you don't see the rewards. \n\nYou can't simply say you were unlucky at every step and call it. If you think life's going against you - change your luck, it's all in your hands. \n\nPeople who have made it far in life don't have to depend on their luck to take them far. They've got everything else to push them along. Be greater, be those people."

You can be burnt out from the massive syllabuses, be tired as hell trying to cram this syllabus into your head. You need to realize the how much the scope of \"pursue different things\" can change. It can be every single field of study in existence or only CS. The normal person forced to study CS/Medicine could have a talent in law or the sciences that goes unfound. \n\nPES itself offers 14 programs, you could go a whole lifetime exploring just these fields. You are also not taking into consideration that interests can also die down as you study what you initially thought is the one for you.\n\nIf I ignore my mental state and how fatigued I am after completing everything I have to study for the day and then do things to find my interest, can you guarantee that ill find my interest? Say everyone in PES takes ur advice and keeps one hour for finding their interest a day. The people who do not find their interest even after they graduate, they probably did not try hard enough right? just spend 1 more hour on finding your interest and this goes on and on. All of this above speculation is ignoring factors like motivation, fatigue, environment. Can you still stay resolute in your belief that hardwork and time is all you need? If everyone does try this advice are you ready to be held accountable for your words?"

Maybe if you spent less time as IIT Bangalorean on reddit and more time actually working on yourself, you wouldn't have made this comment. And this might sound harsh but take it as tough love, not the hate or disdain you all seem to think I have for juniors.\n\n> So which one is it? can I or can I not change my luck\n\nReread it, especially my last paragraph. You can either wait for luck to guide you to success or work hard enough to not need it in the first place. Successful people will always credit their efforts over luck. \n\n> Do you think its that easy to just take out time in these hectic schedules?\n\nAnd you think you guys are the only ones with a hectic schedule? Everyone gets the same 24 hours in a day. I got the same 24 hours as you. Your juniors will in turn get the same 24 hours. Nobody has an extra hour in their life. Now go and read my old comments on prioritising efforts and managing time. You need to take time out within the same 24 hours to work on yourself, whether it's in CS or outside. \n\n> You can be burnt out from the massive syllabuses, be tired as hell trying to cram this syllabus into your head. \n\nHate to make comparisons, but you're forgetting that I'm someone who has been through PES. The stress is not unknown to me, and we had the added burden of 85% attendance. A few batches had it worse with the 5 ISA system. So did people in that batch just give up and say they were unlucky? Or they didn't have the time? You'll find exemplary examples of students who found the time to do everything, and also find examples of students who cut corners by sacrificing their GPA to figure out their interests (like me). I never said that everything is always possible. You will simply need to figure out whats important to you and what can be sacrificed. Don't blame the hectic schedule because that is a constant factor for everyone here, yet you will find people who are able to rise above it. Hectic schedules, massive syllabuses, etc all exist and I am aware, but these are just excuses. When you start working, you are going to have even more responsibilities and work, and you will also be expected to put in time upskilling yourself. So will you then blame your workplace and the pressure for not finding the time? Or will you look for a solution?\n\n> You need to realize the how much the scope of \"pursue different things\" can change. you are also not taking into consideration that interests can also die down as you study what you initially thought is the one for you.\n\nNot sure how this is relevant to this discussion but I will address it anyway: that is always a possibility - my own interests have refined and shifted over the years. That is also part of the process of figuring out your interests. You are under the assumption that once people find their interest they stick to it forever. So what if your interest in a field dies? Try finding what interests you next. Life is all about changes and as the cliche saying goes: change is the only constant. You will change over time, your interests will also change. \n\n> If I ignore my mental state and how fatigued I am after completing everything I have to study for the day and then do things to find my interest, can you guarantee that ill find my interest? The people who do not find their interest even after they graduate, they probably did not try hard enough right?\n\nLol what? Firstly, stop looking to antagonise me or portray me as some apathetic soul when I never made such statements. Secondly, Finding your interest is guaranteed, but when people do it is never the same. So if you think that you are guaranteed to figure out what you like at the end of your 4 years, you are very mistaken. But just because you might not find what you are interested in sooner than others, or your interests can change, does not mean you stop looking. Thirdly, finding your interest is not a terminal process - it can finish and again restart. You start quickly by eliminating other fields and then narrowing down a sub-field to a niche you like. Then one day you might want a change, so you begin again. This process keeps going on throughout your life. If you ask *me* now if my research interest is always going to remain the same I'd say definitely not - but does that mean I just give up on what I am doing now because I may not want to build a career in this later? No. Progress is a continuous process. You need to put in efforts regularly to be where you want to be and pursue what you like. \n\nAlso about mental state and fatigue: I never suggested trying to do everything when I myself never did it. I however do suggest putting in your 100% in whatever is *possible* for you (read my old comments)."

If everyone does try this advice are you ready to be held accountable for your words?\n\nThere honestly seems to be a growing lack of accountability in your batch. Stop jumping the gun and blaming your circumstances for everything. Instead, grow up, behave like adults, and actually look for solutions to the problems you face instead of complaining about them and making excuses for not achieving what you want to. Everyone is dealt a different deck of cards. What matters is how you play them.\n\nIf you want to dream big, you are going to have to make big efforts. There are no shortcuts in life. The so called alumni you and I look up to are all there today because they valued efforts over luck. \n\nHere's a question for you: Right now it seems like all you can think of are the problems in your life and how many ways you can fail. Why aren't you looking at or focusing on the ways you can succeed, the ways you can achieve your dreams or the ways you can pursue your interests? It is very easy to list a 100 problems but difficult to come up with a single solution. Instead of asking me for a guarantee that you will find your interest, why not ask me what to do if your interest changes. Instead of telling me about your academic stress, why not ask me how to manage it. Instead of ranting about so many fields, why not ask me how to approach each field effectively. Instead of making excuses with all the problems in your life, have you even once asked any senior for solutions to these? \n\nYou need a much better outlook on life to actually succeed. Start focusing on how you can solve problems rather than the prolems themselves. There is help from me and others only if you ask. Stop blaming circumstances for what you are going through because everyone is going through it too. The truth is, you are simply not being rational or mature enough yet - read what I have commented with an open mind and spend time regularly introspecting on how to be better. It helps me, might help you too.\n\nI unfortunately do not have more time than this for endless debates here, hope you can take away something from this essay and be a better version of yourself - that is all I wish for you and everyone else."

They give 75% attendance for a reason and u have to take advantage of that, you could bunk classes who you don't have a professor u dont understand or subjects which are easy for you. Definitely humans are the creatures with the most endurance but even that has a limit"
