  "content": "With the recent changes made on the Wi-Fi connection, now we can't download images and videos on WhatsApp. Why tf would they do it. They choked on torrents and steaming services and now they're after regular downloads .Is there anything we as a collective can do ? In spite of paying 4.1L(hostel additional) why is the service so shitty ?? Never thought I'll regret my college choice over such a naÃ¯ve issue. Really disappointed.",

Faced issues where the entire submission portals for some courses were blocked lmao. I was the Teaching Assistant and for a long time couldn't even figure out what the issue was until they told me that they were on hostel WiFi. There was even a short period during which they blocked Quora and Stack Overflow as well cause they came under \"distracting websites\". The WiFi has been a major pain point for hostel kids for a long time now. \n\nAlso as another redditor said, \n\nWelcome to PESU  :)"

The mentality of most students here is that \"The ones who actually want to go and do it will do it, let me be a slimy bug that I am and take advantage of their efforts if they succeed. If they don't, doesn't matter. I didn't antagonize the management, and I would rather suffer than **respectfully** voice out my beliefs and **request** for changes **decently**.\" Emphasis on the bold words because nobody wants to behave like a hooligan.\n\nYeah, the PESU Wi-Fi sucks. They track us and save the logs of every site visit we make, amount of data consumed, etc. They ban many useful websites, and mess around with everything. Honestly, my apathy meter reading is so high that at this point, nothing surprises me."
