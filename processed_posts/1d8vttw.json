However, I fell sick two days before my weakest subjectâ€™s ESA this semester and unfortunately flunked it. I will have to rewrite it and Iâ€™m scared if the backlog exam doesnâ€™t happen on time itâ€™ll come in the way of placements. \nSeniors, please help, im scared to my soul. ",

At the end of the day, you should show that youâ€™ve got the skills they need and youâ€™re ready to learn and improve. And Iâ€™m sure your overall gpa didnt dip too muchâ€¦if itâ€™s above 7 then you can apply to a pretty good amt of companies so keep your head highâ€¦youâ€™re gonna be more than okay"
