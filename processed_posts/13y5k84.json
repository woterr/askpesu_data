  "content": "Here's a list of pros and cons of the college, according to what I've read in this sub:\n\nPros:\n\n* Big CSE placements\n* Updated curriculum\n* Good infrastructure\n* Closer to home (for myself specifically)\n\nCons:\n\n* Extremely academically oriented, leading to stressful college life\n* Mediocre professors \n* Mediocre lab facilities\n* Heard that it is somewhat strict and is basically a \"school 2.0\"\n* Not worth the money if you aren't getting in thru KCET\n* Campus still under construction\n\nLet me know if all this is correct, and add a point in the comments if I missed out anything",
