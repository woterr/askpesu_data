  "content": "Hey everyone, I'm thinking of getting myself into PES for MBA, I have no worries about the education standards or campus etc. my only concern is the placement package, in the brochure they've mentioned the avg of 8lpa for mba students, and last year's data shows the median salary package of mba was 5.60 lpa in pesu.\n\nMy question is how skewed is the placement packages? Is it balanced with like 6-7ish lpa or its actually imbalanced and only like top 5-8% gets the 8lpa package.\n\nSorry for the long a** question. ðŸ™‚",
