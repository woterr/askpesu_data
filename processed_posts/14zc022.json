Pes falls in the former too ig. \n\nPlacements-wise I'd put them in this order - RV, PES, Bms, Msrit.\n\nI've seen all of the campuses and I think PES RR Campus stays on top here, infrastructure-wise. \n\nIn short, college life in all the above mentioned colleges will be sub-par."

A friend of mine studies there.\n\nRamaiah I don't really know much, but I've very often heard some not-so-good things regarding their college. Mostly regarding the students. \n\nPES on the other is very very academic-oriented. It feels like school all over again with a few differences.\n \nOut of the above options, BMS has the better college life. But in general, all of the above are average when it comes to the same."

Things are planned beforehand and they make sure that it runs smoothly (except the times when VTU interrupts)   \nAbout the peers, based on my experience, they're pretty nice. Very helpful, and disciplined. No bullying and they mind their own business. There's also a pleasant coding-culture with frequent hackathons taking place (held by seniors) and you'll find a lot of your peers participating / willing you participate with you."

This compilation is mostly incomplete as the students weren't able to get the complete coverage with respect to the numbers (obviously because our college for some reason gatekeeps the stats).\n\n2. Seniors' batch had like only 350 students (CSE core+ISE) sitting for the placement, so dont get bamboozaled looking at the low number of placed students lmao.\n\n3. Sheet includes only 10+ LPA companies, as mentioned in the upper margin of the excel file."

I understand that I'll obviously have to study but I also don't want to sit in a college dorm for the next 4 years and just do that...\n\ni've heard RCVE has great placements but you have to choose 2 between fun, study, and sleep.. that is the only reason i found to not go there\n\nPES looks to be like a school... very academically focused tho and not a great college life\n\nBMSCE is the only one which says has a decent college life.. not very strict and decent academics as well... but I haven't found any cons yet which is weird and reviews for BMSCE seem to be very minimal which is not helpful and concerning\n\nWould be helpful if you could add on any more info to this.. and also which college should i go for?"
