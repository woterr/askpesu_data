I am very respectful towards the non-teaching staff and many times I have got help from them.\n\nLike during the recent AT, the parking uncle saw me and gave me a water bottle lol (if you were in the queue, you would know how tiring it was). He has also let me go many times without paying when it was late. So yeah, be friendly and respectful."
