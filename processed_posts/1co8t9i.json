My friends who wrote it told me the reality of the exam a couple of days ago and now I know I stand no chance.\nI've studied 12th chem phy and a bit of maths  and in 11th I did chem and phy but only a few imp chapters. I'll probably get around 65 marks.\nTmmrw I'm just going to go and start blind guessing bullshit. I'll add this exam to my list of exams I flunked. Let's see what happens next. Thanks for all the doubts this subreddit answer.",
