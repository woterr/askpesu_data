  "content": "I have a jee mains rank of 44K and though my josaa rounds didn't go well(might be due to my choices), I am quite confident I will get into a good IIIT in the csab rounds. I have taken a CSE AIML seat at RR Campus as backup but today I got to know that the last date to surrender my seat is the 25th of July even though there is no clear date for the second round of councelling. I am having a tough time deciding whether I should surrender my seat or keep it till my seat in the csab rounds is finalised as the refund policy works differently with PES(as they said we can surrender our seat anytime before the second round but have suddenly kept a last date)\n\nCould anyone pls help me with this issue🙏🙏",

The problem with me is that I don't have any particular interest and am open to explore any branch that I recieve, according to what you said in my case it would be better for me to proceed with what I get in csab(this is what I could make up), but I am very much open to this discussion of nit(lower branch) vs good iiit(most of them only offer cse and ece) vs pes(cse aiml) if your okay with providing me advice with four years in the future in mind🙏"

You end up risking being stuck with a degree you despise. Your branch choice today affects many things down the line from your career choices to opportunities to higher education. People pursue what they are already interested in (take career counseling, I went through it in 2016, its literally everywhere nowadays!) and figure out what they want to pursue because its a big decision in your life.\n\nSince you are unable to make up your mind, I am assuming you are looking to get a good placement after undergrad, I would go with a CS branch at IIIT. It's obviously better than CS at PES, but it will also give you similar top placements like a lower branch at a NIT."
