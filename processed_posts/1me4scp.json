  "title": "[Question]regarding PESU KCET registration & counselling process",
  "content": "So I had initially registered on the PESU website, and got a confirmation mail that my registration was successful. Recently, I received my PESU KCET rank card, and then got another mail from PESU saying that there won‚Äôt be any online counselling. Instead, I have to attend offline counselling on a specific date.\n\nI called them to clarify a few things:\n\nI asked if this is for a management seat, and they told me the fees are the same as CET and it‚Äôs not a management quota seat.\n\nI also asked why they haven‚Äôt mentioned the branch allotment in the mail, and they said I‚Äôll get to know during counselling.\n\n\nBut here's my confusion, They mentioned there‚Äôs no online counselling, but in the KEA option entry, PESU RR campus is still listed. So is this offline counselling only for those of us who registered early on PESU‚Äôs portal?\nLike‚Ä¶ is there a separate seat allocation process going on for us? Or is this something else entirely?\n\nIf anyone has been through this or has some clarity, please help üôè",
