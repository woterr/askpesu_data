Thanks to the mods as well for their help:)\n\nIn terms of suggestions I canâ€™t really think of that many except maybe having a couple more mods we can reach out to? And maybe a sort of thread where juniors can ask seniors stuff and hence can check if their question has already been answered? It may even exist I just havenâ€™t seen it ig lol ;)"

So kindly keep a check on those users and ban them accordingly."
