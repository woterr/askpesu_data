Since your first semester has 24 credits, it will contribute to almost 24/160 = 15% of your final GPA. \n\nIf you really want to know *how* much a 4.0 GPA can affect your final GPA, then use the GPA calculator in the FAQs. Enter 4.0 for sem 1 and whatever you wish for sems 2-8."

The weightage actually increases a bit if you consider the fact that for placements, only the first 6 semesters' GPA is practically counted."
