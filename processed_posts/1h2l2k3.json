For us, it was 20 (idk what is the current situation with PES making STs optional in 2nd and 3rd year). And yeah, any courses/internships through which you earned credits will add to your total credits, reducing the number of courses you need to take up in final year, which is why I always suggest taking up STs even though they're optional"
