Getting an interview will be the same process for everyone but in the interview it will max to max be a talking point and not something which will give your profile a boost. Minor courses are for your knowledge and you must learn those essential CS topics to ace your technical interviews. Don't expect to just breeze through the minors and have a 'specialised' treatment."
