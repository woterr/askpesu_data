      "body": "Attendance 7:30 onwards. You could come in anytime before 10 (but you'll have to inform the warden if you're that late. They're chill as long as the reason is valid.) I've come in as late at 8:45 - 9 without the warden being suspicious. You got to look out for the guards at the college gate though. They're the ones who'll get you in trouble.  Once past that, you're good to go.\n\nWiFi scene is the same throughout campus. Blocked from gaming sites as far as I remember. Tunneling can cause latency issues and sometimes long episodes of lag spikes depending on how fast / reliable the service is. VPNs are prohibited by college. Do what you want with this information.\n\nI've gotten decent latency (50-100ms) on my phone connected by usb tethering."
