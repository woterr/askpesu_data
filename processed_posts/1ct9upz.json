I already saw the post by rowlet owl I was asking for insights on which college I should choose and will PES refund my fees if I get a better college. How is that repetitive? Pls don't remove my post this time I really need help to make an informed decisionüôè\n\n.[https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/1ct5ujc/which\\_branch\\_can\\_i\\_get\\_at\\_no\\_dont\\_make\\_such\\_posts/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/1ct5ujc/which_branch_can_i_get_at_no_dont_make_such_posts/) \n\nI fked up my CET and COMEDK so my only options now are VIT Vellore, PES and Amrita CSE core. If I go for PES or Amrita I can be a day scholar but if I go for VIT I have to go to hostel. But my main deciding factor is placement. Can someone list the priority order I should follow keeping this in mind? I got 14XX rank what are the odds of getting CSE in RR campus? ",

You can see what branches you can get here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/1ct5ujc/which\\_branch\\_can\\_i\\_get\\_at\\_no\\_dont\\_make\\_such\\_posts/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/1ct5ujc/which_branch_can_i_get_at_no_dont_make_such_posts/)\n3. As for your options, I would recommend PES > VIT > Amrita. The same link I attached also has my comment which includes placement statistics over the last 3 years."

Or like 1.5 months. You can talk to the admission team about this they will give you an idea about what the rules are for the year. I understand it‚Äôs tough to take a decision but if you are from Bangalore Pes is the best option! Placement is better than most of the colleges and you can maintain a gpa for masters too. All the best!"
