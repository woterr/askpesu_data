See they're not marvelous or anything but they're not bad either.\nDon't go in with expectations of something mind-blowing. It just gives you an opportunity to work on a project and if you work hard it would lead to a publication.\nIt gives you something to put in your resume, the research is great practice for capstone, you can build connections with professors for LORs. \nIf you somehow get an internship in a company go right ahead. But if you don't ( which most won't) this is definitely better than sitting home.\nAll in all if you do it with a good group of people it'll be a pretty chill good experience."
