However, it's unlikely you will get placed early (in a T1) since you'll be competing with all the high GPA students while shortlisting. \n2. Projects should be substantial and completed ones, ones that show your skills and aren't a copy-paste of things you can find online. Also, they should be sizeable and not something someone can put together overnight, so aim for end to end projects. Also, it helps if they're all related to the job you are applying for and/or the field you are interested in. \n3."
