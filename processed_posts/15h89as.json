It was originally set up with funding from Nokia for a fixed number of years so it was the Nokia Innovation Lab, which was then rebranded to the Microsoft innovation lab after the acquisition. \n\nMicrosoft slowed down campus hiring in 2022 but it's sad to hear they still haven't come back to hire. It might just be the usual IIT-BITS preference for a bit since most of the folks who were placed with them are still there. I wouldn't be surprised if management did something to tick them off though."
