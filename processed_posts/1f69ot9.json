We've just decided to pay through that challan option cuz we don't want to waste any time, please let me know if the \"pay online\" option starts working"

I might go with the Challan too. Could you tell me the payment process through Challan? \n\nFrom what I've read, all I have to do is sign on it -> take the challan to one of the 3 banks they've mentioned -> probably enter our account details and after the transaction the admission order should be visible on the website?"

After clicking \"pay now\" it took me to the page where all my details were there, like name, cet number and so on and asked me how i'd like to pay - either through the bank account details way or net banking (I chose net banking)\n2. After the payment was done, it didn't show if it was successful, so we panicked a little but we logged out and logged in again and we were shown that the payment was made and the link to download the admission order was activated. So yes, I was able to download the admission order.\n3. I'm not really aware of this point... What exactly is a student and a college copy?\n4. Yes, I was able to download the receipt and we took a print out too"

The bank will take the bank copi and we'll get the candidate copy and we have to give PES the college copy when we go for docs. submission. I think for you, the \"college copy\" will be equal to the receipt of the payment ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
