Most of the stuff that youâ€™ll actually use in the industry. \n\nI slacked off during my 3rd and 4th sem, and I regret it now. \n\nLearn from otherâ€™s mistakes (mine) and put all the effort you can. 5th and 6th sem are very very easy, so Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll be able to get good scores then. \n\nAll the best!"
