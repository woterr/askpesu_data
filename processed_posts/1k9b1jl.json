That's 20 lakhs.   \nIncluding scholarship, it would be lesser yes, so I'm assuming you calculated the 12 lakhs number thinking you'd get scholarship in every semester. \n\nIs it worth it? nope.   \nDo you have another option? it depends on your particular situation. Most Indian universities aren't worth it to be honest. You'd very rarely find motivated teachers who like or even understand what they are teaching and PES is no different."
