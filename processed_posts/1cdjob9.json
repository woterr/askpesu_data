Regardless, a laptop is a must from your first year itself, if not for coursework, for your other activities in college - mainly hackathons. I made the same mistake of buying a PC before college but now I've ended up with a PC and a laptop. \n\nFrom second year onwards, bringing a laptop everyday is a norm here in EC campus at least. It's as essential as books were in your academic experience until now"
