  "content": "I attended the counselling online, 35xx . I chose cs at ec campus but the screen was too blurred so i couldn’t really see the confirmation. I did see my name at the waiting list. And I still haven’t gotten any confirmation from pes side so I’m kinda confused. If anyone has got any recordings or screenshots from 3500-3600 that’d be really helpful.",
