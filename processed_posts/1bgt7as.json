  "content": "The KCET cutoffs I've seen/asked have been pretty varied, some websites seem to be showing below 1200 for a CS seat (RR campus) meanwhile I know some seniors who got in with high 2000's ranks.\nThe official cutoff, atleast what I assume it is (Picture attached) seems to show a cutoff of somewhere around 3000.\nIve gotten 293+ in my PCM and get consistently 110+ in KCET mock tests, what are the chances I can get a AIML seat in RR Campus",
