The college is definitely strict, however the EC campus clubs are quite active so there will be a lot of events to participate in, design competitions, open mic, dance performances, workshops, hackathons, etc.\n\nIf by fun you mean being able to hang out with friends after college or by bunking classes, there is no restrictions placed on you in that respect. As long as you have more than 85% attendance and can manage the classes you missed on your own, there is no problem at all. You wouldn't be able to walk out of the classroom in the middle of classes (obviously) but during either the short or lunch breaks you can leave/join the classes without a problem."

You can open up you laptops in class join some game room online(listening to class doesn't matter for most theoretical subjects) and have fun or just normal talking, 3 days in a week are half days you can go the MRD centre play some Table tennis , 8 ball pool, Carom, chess, Badminton (u need non marking shoes for this). College isnt that strict also tbh just that people have some other expectations like you can study 1 night before and get good grades and can get away with 50% attendance which wont work here. It all matters in the friend group."

Wednesday is always a half day. \n\nThe class timings are from 8 am to 4pm. But again, when each day ends depends on your timetable somedays, they end at 1 others at 2, 3 or 4."
