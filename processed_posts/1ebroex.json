Last year they had combined auditions for first round where you had to learn and perform choreography for any song of your choice. \nFor second round each club had separate auditions where they would teach you a choreography and you had to learn in on spot.\nYou can check their insta if you want to know more about them I guess. They will post about the auditions there."
