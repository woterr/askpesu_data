So I've thought of asking about this. If there is an access could you please comment. Thank you in advance.",

      "body": "\t1.\tThere’s no shared drive or list of every team’s capstone project. And honestly, there’s no way to know if a similar project already exists somewhere.\n\t2.\tYou and your team need to decide everything yourselves, the topic, the domain, and the idea. You can approach mentors, but it’s up to them whether they agree to guide you.\n\t3.\tOnce you have your ideas, you pitch them to a mentor. If the mentor knows that idea has already been done in previous years, or if another team is already working on something too similar, they’ll reject it and ask you to come up with something else.\n\t4.\tI’m not completely sure, but I think they’ll also make you fill out a form with your project title, domain, and description. That way, if two teams end up with the same idea, the one who submits later will probably have to change theirs. Someone correct me if I’m wrong.\n\t5.\tA capstone isn’t about following a fixed set of topics. It’s about forming a team, picking a mentor, and building a project around a “problem statement” that you decide on. There’s no official list of ideas, you’re free to choose whatever you want.\n."
