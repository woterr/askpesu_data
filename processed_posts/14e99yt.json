  "content": "I received a message from pes telling me to upload kcet marks or indicate if i haven't taken the exam. I wrote kcet but didn't get the rank because of some issue with my board marks and honestly didn't care to follow up with it because my scores were bad anyways. Should I just say i didn't write kcet or is there a specific reason why they ask people this",
