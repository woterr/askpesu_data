      "body": "DSA/LeetCode/NeetCode + Projects\n\nIf your main goal is to get placed through campus placements, this is the way to go.\n\nBy the time your 5th semester starts, a bunch of companies will be recruiting interns for the next summer (after your 3rd year). These internships usually convert to PPOs, so prepping early is key.\n\nGet strong in DSA, learn to trace algorithms, and brush up on DBMS + SQL. PES teaches DBMS in the 5th sem, but that’s also when you'll be giving OAs/interviews, so don’t wait till then.\n\nDo GenAI projects (solid ones) or Web Dev if it interests you. If you pick Web Dev, build something actually useful—don’t just clone Instagram.\n\nCGPA matters in this path, so try to keep it decent. That said, even if you’re not great at development, being strong in DSA and logic-building can still get you through.\n\nResearch Internship at NIT/IIT/IISc Bangalore\n\nGo for this if:\na) You’re planning to do a master’s.\nb) Your CGPA isn’t great, but you want something solid on your resume.\n\nInstead of just applying through Google Forms, try getting contacts or referrals—it’s tough for 2nd years to land official research internships otherwise.\n\nPick a topic, learn the basics, and actually get involved in the research. Build a good rapport with the professor. At the very least, make sure you get a certificate, even if there’s no stipend.\n\nInternship at a Startup (via Referral)\n\nIf you want to get some real-world experience, this is a good option.\n\nMost 2nd-year startup internships happen through referrals or direct outreach (LinkedIn is your best bet). If you have decent exposure to OS and system programming, startups in HPC-AI and System Core often have openings, even for 2nd years.\n\nEven if it’s unpaid, try to get a certificate—it’ll help later.\n\nResearch Internship at a Private College\n\nOnly take this if you’re 100% sure about the professor you’ll be working with, their ability to guide you, and the actual problem statement you’ll be working on.\n\nOtherwise, it’s better to skip this and focus on placements or research at better institutes. Research quality at most private colleges is pretty bad—usually just for the sake of publications, and it won’t help you much in the long run."
