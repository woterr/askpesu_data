However, one question comes to mind: why is it that over 50% of the syllabus is covered in the first year, yet it contributes less than 5% to a career in CSE? Considering that PES University claims to be the No. 1 university in Karnataka, shouldn't they focus on a more practical, real-world-oriented syllabus? I‚Äôm not sure if my perspective is entirely correct, but it‚Äôs something to think about."
