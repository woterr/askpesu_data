So happy I graduated when there were totally 900 kids in CS across both campuses. \n\nTo answer your question, companies will not increase their intake just because the college increases theirs. Competition will skyrocket because each company takes in at most 10-15 students (being generous here). Good luck lol."

The management is not responsible to get you placed - its up to you to be industry ready. The large intake only makes it worse for everyone. \n\nDM me if you want to know where I work."

The most cost-effective way to filter is through a combination of CGPA and your score in the OA. If many perform well in the OA, then the CGPA requirement automatically goes up. Before, only a few companies (<10) would stick to a 9+ CGPA cutoff, expect more companies to increase their requirement now."
