  "content": "This doc is based on over two years of firsthand experience in PES ECE, offering a brutally honest take on what to expect, how to survive, and how to make the most of your four years. Whether you're here by choice or chance, read this before diving in. It myt feel a bit biased to a few students based on how rigorous the course is or since there's no sugarcoating on it, but that's how your next 4 years will be. This doc just sums up how ECE will be irrespective of the campus you are in.\n\n[ECE Heads-up](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KAofElKiijZWCGRJCl2UDndW_Zi50r5c7erxnbrjEJk/edit?usp=sharing)",

      "body": "Definitely it is both math and phy intensive, math will deal with different series and transforms for conversions and so on. Phys comes into picture when ur talking about quantum and electronics part i.e circuitry or flow of current. The most important aspect of physics being used is in quantum followed by Electromagnetic Field Theory i.e ur class 11 and 12 topics consisting of electricity and magnetism."
