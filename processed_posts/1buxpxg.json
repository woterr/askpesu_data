  "content": "So, I am thinking of doing my BBA in Business Analytics from PES University and have a lot of doubts and questions and many of them are unanswered after reading the website and extensive research. Your input will be helpful! \n\n1) Does IOA(UK) actually play any role in this course or is it there just for name's sake?\n\n2)  Does this course keep you up to date with industry skills, especially with the AI(ML and NLP) stuff?\n\n3) Are the placements decent? I know they aren't that great but are they at least consistent with them?\n\n4)Staff, teachers/professors, are they like super strict... I've seen some videos and I know I shouldn't generalize but does it affect with their teaching capabilities?\n\n5) Also does anybody have a copy of the syllabus? I can't seem to find it anywhere.\n\nThank you!",

Plus it gives a option to do your 4th year as MSc in UK, or Entrepreneurship or as Specialization I'm your domain interest with the company you got placed in."
