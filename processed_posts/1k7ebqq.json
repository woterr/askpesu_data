The placements for non tech and core is decent, and for higher studies, it is also sexy. I personally think cse in pes would be better but for mains kids the roi is shit tbh. U guys are paying 6.5lpa for a normal btech degree. Only bits could justify that amount."

NSUT hain at the end of the day, badiya and sec c companies come here. And by chance if you get interested in non tech or core or even post grad then toh it becomes an easy choice. NSUT mech would be a clear better option in this scenario.\n\nBaaki if you are able to get a good scholarship and the fees comes down to 2lpa then take it. Also UP state college cse toh bilkul mat lena. It would be shit af. It should not even be an option for you. Bhul ja usse, unless the state college nit Allahabad which I highly doubt"
