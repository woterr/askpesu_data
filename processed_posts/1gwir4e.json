  "content": "One theory me and a few others have, and also somewhat subtly verified by some profs is that the 20 lab marks are not counted at all for final grade in 5 credit subject. These lab marks are never released on PESU app, and based on the marks in review too, grade seems to be based on internals + ESA marks(people with different lab marks noticing that their final grade is not affected by it). I'm not 100% certain about this but I think there is a high chance.\n\nAny other conspiracies y'all are aware of? Need not be related to academics.",

Idk a single person who claimed their performance was unexpected in the Exam, unlike for VITEE or Comedk.   \nU have to give credit where credit is due, Passat is legit. If they rly wanted to do rank manipulation they would have never switched to JEE, as the ranks are not in their control now."

I did all my assignments well, everything to perfection, but messed up my lab exam terribly (submitted a blank paper, didnt conduct the experiment at all. Did my viva fine though). Everyone in my class got either a 9 or a 10 in their assessment.. I ended up with a 6 or 7. Grinded my ass for my isas esas lol ended up with a B.  \nSo ye,  \ntldr: they definitely do get counted"
