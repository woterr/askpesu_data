Instead of checking how much you remember, they will check how you would search for the information and utilize it in answering the question. Obviously the questions they're gonna give will be super hard difficulty."

      "body": "That defeats the point of an open book exam. These exams are always designed to be significantly harder. Open book exams aren't really the saving grace people think they are because in most cases, if the paper is set to be open book it means they never expected you to complete it in a closed book setting."
