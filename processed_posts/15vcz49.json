I am in second year CSE and last year in our PESSAT counselling they offered 360 CSE seats in both campuses even though the seats matrix indicates only 288 seats are there for CSE in both the campuses.\n\nBut the second round was different from this year's. RR CSE, EC CSE , RR AIML ample seats were there for the 2nd round as far as I remember."
