As for the rest, it's looking bleak right now. \n\nBut you need to understand the industry is just like this. It bloats up and then shrinks in cycles. 2000 this happened, then 2008, and now.\n\nStart prepping early. Get specialised knowledge and skills in your area of interest. Apply off campus from the get go and float your resume to your network. This is after all just a numbers game."

Textbooks, websites, videos etc. Consider yourself lucky to even get content on PESU Academy. Batches before you (including mine) never had content provided to us like this - we had to depend on textbooks or class notes. You guys definitely have it easier when it comes to getting academic material for courses.\n\nAlso, teaching quality only gets you so far, you still need to actively put in effort to build something beyond your GPA. Poor teaching quality might explain an average GPA at best, but not having the skills required for a job is completely on you.\n\nMy DMs are always open on if you need advice on how to build your profile. Good luck."

And what's this about succeeding in life bro? What's your definition of success? I just want bare minimum and I'll do my thing, if I can't even expect that, I fucking wasted my life here."

A job is a 2 way street, you can't expect money from your employer if you can't provide any value or atleast show that you can provide value. Best thing to do now is learn more, do projects and improve your chances. Its very competitive out there where people without a degree yet are doing a lot in open source. Now why would a potential employer not hire someone with real valuable contributions and showcase of skill."

Theres too many ppl and everyone wants a job. Even the bare minimum can be hard to achieve. \n\nJust go and study fam, have some belief that you can do better. \n\nI am no career counselor but im sure with a decent GPA and if you do something like an MBA after this you should still be fine.
