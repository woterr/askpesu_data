I didn't take it though but I know friends who did. AIRIW is easy, it used to be a VERY easy subject with an effortless S or A before but it does require some amount of work now lol. It's still mostly theory with easy projects/assignments. \n\nCSE has Data Analytics as a single subject where recommender systems was the last chapter."
