  "content": "Just curious — is there an actual gaming scene on campus where people meet up and throw hands (virtually, of course)? Like Street Fighter, Tekken, Smash, etc. Or is everyone just silently grinding ranked in their rooms?\n\nWould be cool to know if there are any casual tournaments, clubs, or just folks who play together in person now and then. Not looking for esports-level sweatfests — just some good matches and fun banter.\n\nAlso, if there’s a Discord or WhatsApp group floating around, I’d love to hop in. \n\nDrop a reply or DM if you're into this too!",
