( gotta pay FULL 4.5L fee)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd to the seniors : Can you please tell how much time it takes? And how are these seats allotted? Like first come first serve or..? Like if I have 2k rank and i want cse will they give it to me just cause I am first there or nah?",

If someone has achieved a lesser rank than you and they don't show up when called, their name will be omitted and the next person will be called upon. There will be a screen that displays how many seats are available per branch in each campus and once a student is called, they will have to go upto the desk near the podium and you'll have to tell them what branch and campus you're opting for."

Idk if they've changed it now, but for me, you could see the seat you got, then confirm it and then pay the fees. So if you got a bad seat you could just leave. Ec campus cs isn't as good as rr cs but it's still way better than ece. Usually counseling takes like 3-4 hrs. Seats are given on a rank basis and by the time your rank comes, you can choose a seat from whatever seats are left. It's a very transparent and simple system. After choosing a seat you need to submit your documents and pay the fees and they'll give you a welcome kit and you'll be done. Good luck :)"
