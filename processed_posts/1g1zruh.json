You are *probably* trying to use selenium, which isn't needed. You can find more details on how to go about this from `pesuacademy-py` library that HSP built [here](https://github.com/HackerSpace-PESU/pesuacademy-py/blob/d37f5afd6ea34456e2bdbbed82c040c159f8005b/pesuacademy/pesuacademy.py#L88-L123).\n\nAlternatively, you can also use the library directly and fetch details.\n\n`pip install pesuacademy`\n\n```python\nfrom pesuacademy import PESUAcademy\n\np = PESUAcademy()\nprofile = p.know_your_class_and_section(PRN)\n```\n\nI'd suggest using the library. You can refer to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/HackerSpace-PESU/pesuacademy-py) for more documentation."
