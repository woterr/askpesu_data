  "content": "Companies have been visiting almost everyday. Sometimes even 2 companies conduct test on the same day. So far I've been applying to all, so I don't find time to actually prepare. Most companies expect us to come to campus, which is far from my home. By the time I reach home, I'm already tired.\n\nIn this case, is it better to choose which companies to apply for or should I continue applying to all?\n\nI fear I might lose out on opportunities to get a tier 1 offer if this keeps happening.",

I would suggest not skipping any T1 and T2 companies and selectively applying to T3. Right now, given the market and competition, it would not be wise to be too picky.  Just apply to everything that comes your way and matches with your intentions and hope for the best."

After the person rejected the offer of the other 2 companies, will the companies try to hire another candidate to fill the vacancy?\n\nLooking at the long run, isn't this favoring the person who has loads of skills and has the capabilities of getting multiple offers, but deserting the ones who are mediocre in skills?"

      "body": "I think you are unaware of the placement policy. You can *receive* at most 2 offers. The moment you accept an offer, you are out of the placement process (even if it's the first offer you receive). After you receive 2 offers, whether you accept the 2nd or reject that as well, you're out of the placement process too. \n\nAnd that's how life works. If you're mediocre, you will be in a tough spot. It's not \"favouring\" because the person with a higher skill level is being rewarded based on merit."
