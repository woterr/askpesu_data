On joining the company it turns out he had only frontend related work.\n\nA decent number of ECE students do opt for higher studies, yes.\n\nGraduating from ECE, 8-8.5 is a pretty good CGPA, you should have nothing to worry about."

It could be own venture,/entrepreneurship/workÂ inÂ aÂ firm\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe actual work experience would open up perspectives which an individual had not thought of .. Without quality work experience,  quality perspective MBA will not render good learning/benefits\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \nA good cgpa above distinction is good to have.   \nBut more importantly an individual need to build a comprehensive experience. study/hobby project/other initiatives/social concern/building ideas and showcasing creativity. It's a combination and weighted average of all these is would get an individual into ivy league. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*MBA within india:*  \n*You have option of taking CAT and GMAT*  \n*Of course, ISB and IIMs(A/B/C/I/L/K) are extremely good and on par with top world universities*  \n*Outside India:*  \n*Mostly GMAT + university specific entrance tests*"
