  "content": "Hey guys I’m a senior (batch of 2025) who’s going to pass out next year. Over the years at the hostel I’ve accumulated a lot of books from my seniors (mostly 1st year coursework books). Since I don’t nearly need them anymore I’m giving them away at half the price (they’re in mint condition) or even lesser.\n\nAnyone interested in any books can dm me and I can check if I have them or else they’re gonna end up with the kabaadi’s :,)",
