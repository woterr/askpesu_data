I graduated in 2022, and I do not remember anything being said about it this year, the previous year and tbh pretty much since I joined in 2018. \n\nIts possible it does not exist anymore and the site hasn't been updated. A lot of PESU websites such as the clubs website, are actually outdated and should not be depended upon for accurate information."
