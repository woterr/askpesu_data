As the new building starts functioning then it will cross 1000+ students for CSE in RR. Now the number of companies that come every year to hire students arenâ€™t increasing as the batch size is increasing. Each of these companies have a fixed pool of students to hire, just because PES increases intake, companies canâ€™t do the same xD.\n\nThis dilutes the quality as well, to give a statistic, the number of students in 2022 batch who has internships were 132, and for my batch it came down to just 86, that too a few applied off campus in that. There are a number of reasons for this, but expect that quality has dipped, intake is high, college isnâ€™t giving you time for whatâ€™s needed, so placement is gonna be stressful. This is my PoV"

Nobody's gonna talk about the good things that's happening, If there's an addressing and new implementations been made, I have never seen people appreciating the good ones, people always pick something to rant about. I think it's because most people like to play the victim. \n\nIn short I agree it's not as good as advertised but it's definitely not as bad as people portray it here, and this is from my experience."
