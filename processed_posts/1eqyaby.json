      "body": "If fee ain't a problem then I would definitely say AIML at RR. As mentioned, all the infrastructure, exposure, community and placements are above par. I wouldn't necessarily say you'd get freedom as much in BMS but it isn't on the other extreme too, it all comes to how well you manage things. Also, now that we know the syllabus of AIML, I'd say it isn't much different from CSE provided you choose the right electives in 3rd year. The competition will also be higher in BMS since the intake is 1500 now. It Ultimately is your choice!"

Mainly coz I've heard syllabus in pes most updated.\nAnd better infra but I need to go check that for myself physically.\nHave heard bms is more chill. Placement is probably the same.\nWouldn't worry much abt competition tbh, pes has combined placements soo"
