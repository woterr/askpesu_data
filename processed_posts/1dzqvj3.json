I went there on july 6th as my hostel admission was alloted on july 7th , so i clubbed both the trips to banglore. They told us that Migration Certificate & some long memo of 12th can be submmited on the date of joining or anytime after july 15th, everything else need to submitted before 15th. Thats what they told on july 6th. idk whatll happen if we dont submit I have to go again for 2nd counselling . PES has everything offline .. they should make a couple of things online. Hope you got some clarity. Now they have extended it to july 25th according to their website (i think it happens every year)  \nImportant Dates :- [https://pes.edu/important-dates/](https://pes.edu/important-dates/)"
