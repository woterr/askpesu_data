  "content": "Earlier when we'd go to important dates section, it showed a possible 2nd round in July 2025 but now it is removed. Looks like it won't happen. This is so bad, didn't even get the chance to appear and lost 1000 rs too. Also in some other post on the sub, someone did comment that very less seats were surrendered so 2nd round has been cancelled, which kinda validates. Tough luck, i have :)",
