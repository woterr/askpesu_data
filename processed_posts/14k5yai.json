But i didnt quite understand the concept even though the subject looks interesting. What will I a first year be knowledgeable enough to research on? The professor did give me a topic and ask me to read up on it and said he would answer every doubt, but i would like somebody with such experience to please weigh in on this as i have no clue what i need to do.",

If you are interested in the subject (which you say you are), and your prof has invited you, go for it! It will be a valuable experience and you will learn/pickup the skills over time. Not many people get an invitation like this from a prof to work on research here, you should make the most of this opportunity that you have :)"
