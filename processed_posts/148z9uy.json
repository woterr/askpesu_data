These courses are for those who want to take more courses or want to ease the workload later. You will in all likelihood have to take up a couple of courses in the 7th semester. If you take 2 now, you can reduce the number of courses you take in that semester, thus giving yourself more time for Capstone, placements etc.\n\nu/Enough_Interest_5951 these courses are indeed useful, and some tend to be interesting as well. They also last 5 days exactly. They are \\*definitely\\* worth taking up."
