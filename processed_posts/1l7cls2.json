EC has more open spaces, better tech clubs, but RR has better infra, bigger fests (although I'll add in that you can always attend fests at any campus), more clubs (not better though). At the end of the day, both campuses will provide you with the same opportunities and degree. What will differ is the experience. \n\nBesides, the campus is going to affect you for 3 years; the branch you choose today sticks with for your life. Now which is more important?"

      "body": "This really boils down to what you expect from your \"college life\". Regardless of which campus you end up in, you will still have to deal with the fact that you're in PES. It's going to be academically rigorous, and most of the time you'll be cussing the college out rather than your campus. \n\nIt's already been answered in the FAQ's, but there is quite literally no difference in the campuses. RR has more intake, so sure you might find your crowd there, but it doesn't mean that EC has a \"bad\" crowd. The buildings are newer in RR, so if the college life you are picturing involves looking at fancy buildings, go ahead, take whichever course you get there. \n\nEven if you don't get the chance to switch to the course you want now, at the end of the first year, you'll be allowed to switch courses/campuses based on your cgpa. If you truly hated the experience you got at EC, you can just shift then lol (shifting to RR-CSE is incredibly tough though) . Choose what you're interested in, don't make a decision purely because the reality didn't match your expectations :)"
