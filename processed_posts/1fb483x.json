  "content": "1. College timings for MBA is from 8 am to 6 45 pm\n2. Placement percentage is less than 50% past year\n3. For Completion of 1 year you have to complete three trimesters, so there will be total of 6 trimesters (T1- T6)\n4. T1 & T2 are mixture of every subjects like finance marketing HR . \n3. In T3 you have to choose your major and minor subjects \n4. After T4 you should start your interns\nThese are about academics .\nApart from that you will have research papers to submit which is senseless according to me. They will treat you as a PU Students.\nThere will be no happiness until and unless you get a good placement. They will not let you to sit free. They may even call you on Saturday and make a full day class. \nIf you have 15 lakhs and you want to enjoy your degree you should join other b school which ensures better placement also. \nAny queries feel free to ask.",

Even some of the faculty subtly (or openly) discourage students from pursuing it here. Why? Because it‚Äôs simply not worth the money or the mental toll.\n\nPlacements are underwhelming at best. The orientation for B.Com specializations in my 3rd semester was a huge red flag. The dean, without hesitation, said: ‚ÄúWe take in only top-notch students with good rankings for MBA, so we don‚Äôt have to work much on them.‚ÄùThat right there shows the mindset they won‚Äôt support you, they‚Äôll use your academic record to promote the institution while giving you the bare minimum in return.\n\nThey‚Äôre more focused on image than outcome. Don‚Äôt fall for the branding‚Äîlook beyond the campus tours and glossy brochures. Choose wisely."
