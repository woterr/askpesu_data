There have been instances when I just flip away whenever I see a person passing by me, though I’m very much into her. I do not go party with other late night, there’s no friend who’d invite me for their house party. Does this happen only with me?",

Ek kaam kr ghost kr fir wo teko puchegi ki ye achanak kya hua fir v kuch mt krna ekdm passive ho jana fir ek point ayega jb wo fraustate ho jayegi aur terese aggressively puchegi ki aakhir baat kya hai . Tb sach sach btana ki mena teko like krne lga hu muze starting me lga ki ye natural hai but time to time ye badhta hi ja rha tha . Hm acche friends hai but me dr gya tha ki atleast ye jo friendship hai wo bhi nhi rhegi so mene dur jana hi behtar samza . Ab usko past me koi sa accha incidence memories karao aur bolo ki hmri friends journey yhi tak thi me en memrioes me hi khush hu . Aur last me boloki i love you would we be my life long patner untill and after death . But silent ho jao ( 95+ chances ki wo ha bolegi )\n( 100% chances ki result future ke liye achhe hi honge kyunki ye bolne ke baad friends rehna mtlb khud ko fadke zeel ke samne rakhne jaisa hoga ) \n.\n.\nNote : 1)agr wo tumko ghost krne ka baad koi effort nhi dal rhi to samz lena ki wo kv tume intrested hi nhi thi..........\n2)agr wo last me agressive hue aur agr fir v tumne ghost kiya to wo etny hurt ho sakti hai ki kv tere pass v nhi aayegi so be careful it's a risky stunt\n\n\nKhush khvri dena ( Glow job ke baad )"

Playing with one's emotions for your own selfish needs is just pure evil. this kind of manipulation damages the other person badly because the relationship is not based on trust and respect. Suggesting this method shows you are narcissistic. Grow up, things don't work this way. If you follow such lowly methods you may momentarily gain  but you will eventually lose out in all angles. This will bring a lot of shame too.  Stop behaving like a toddler and behave maturely. People aren't toys to be exploited. \n\nWomen, reading this, be aware. Narcissism is on the rise."
