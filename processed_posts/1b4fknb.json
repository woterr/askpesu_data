  "content": "Hey Guys\n\nSooo, another year of our juniors trying to get into PES and having multiple doubts and questions!\n\nRemember, while answering them, let's try our best to help them out snd try clearing their doubts! Obviously some questions would have subjective answers, but let's be civil and open about why we think what we think\n\nAnd finally please use the user flairs for getting a layer of authenticity to your answers, because the flair would allow the OP to know who's answering the question... A senior/a graduate or non PESU peeps\n\nThanks for the amazing contributions to the community, it's grown so big already. I am looking forward for larger milestones and brining more peeps into this PESU network \n\nGood Luck and Happy Days :)",
