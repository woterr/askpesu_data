  "content": "I don't get it. I'm in my 6th semester, studying CSE. So we got news saying we have labs for every subject. One lab every day. On top of that we have 5 internal assessments. \n\nIt's so annoying and tiring. The chairperson told us not to expect a response and said the system won't change. \n\nApparently ece peeps have to write notes and upload on teams. This is getting so outta hand. I thought 6th semester was the most important one. They're dumping so much on us and we even have capstone. \n\nTo anyone who is planning on joining pes, please fuckin DON'T. Pes is a scam. \n\nAnd what tf can we do about this shit now? Everyone's willing to protest. But how can we raise our concerns in s more serious manner?\n\nAny info can help. Thanks in advance",

It feels like every subject has assignments and projects and 5 ISAs AND they increased the number of hours in the week, that's way too much to handle, along with capstone."

PES is becoming too rigorous for studies and have no consideration of students in mind :/\n\nWhat's the point of calling yourself a university if all you do is study\n\nRegarding protests, it's a private institution and the decision cannot be changed by UGC because it's not going against any guidelines. I think pressure from parents and students can try to stir the college for a change. Get parents involved because they are the only \"stakeholders\" PES is concerned about. Please remain anonymous during all interactions because stuff like this can have future consequences on your graduation!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood Luck"

Problem rn is that all you guys are competing online, so there's a lot more cheating and it's harder as such.\n\nDisclaimer that my advice is from like 2019"
