  "content": "My timetable was designed by a sadistðŸ™‚.\nEarly morning class? Sure. Random 4-hour gap? Of course. A cursed 4:30 PM lab? Why not.\nBy the time Iâ€™m done, itâ€™s dark outside, my soul has aged 10 years, and I still have to fight an auto driver for a reasonable fare. College isnâ€™t education,itâ€™s endurance training. Dukhi aatma hogyi hu :) !!",
