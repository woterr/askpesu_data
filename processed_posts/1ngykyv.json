      "body": "**Phase 1 (End of 5th sem - 2 credits)**  \nForm your team and choose a mentor. By the end of this phase, you need to finalize the domain and problem statement for your capstone project.\n\n**Phase 2 (6th sem - 2 credits)**  \nNow that you have a problem statement, this phase is about research. You‚Äôll be expected to do a literature review, read papers related to your problem and pick out what‚Äôs useful for your project. You‚Äôll also need to make a presentation covering your findings, a rough project timeline, high-level architecture, and a master class diagram (basically an overview of your project plan). At this stage, you should also start showing some early results, like dataset exploration or basic experiments.\n\n**Summer break (after 6th sem)**  \nYour team should use this time to build a working prototype or at least get solid results that show your project is close to completion.\n\n**Phase 3 (7th sem - 4 credits)**  \nAt the start of the semester, you‚Äôll present a working prototype. Since you won‚Äôt have regular classes, the expectation is that you‚Äôll complete your final prototype in this semester. You also need to write and finish your research paper based on the project.\n\n**Phase 4 (8th sem - 4 credits)**  \nThis is the wrap-up stage. You‚Äôll refine your paper and work on getting it published in a journal. Once that‚Äôs done, your capstone is complete."
