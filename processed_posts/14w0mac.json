  "content": "I kept jss and nie mysore below because my prefrence towards bangalore is more. \n\nAlso I know I will not rvce cs but have just kept it. \n\nBy looking previous year cutoffs i can get these colleges(also chances are 2022 cutoffs will repeat this year since seats have increased) \n\nI just want your suggestions that whether this order is good or not or should I make any changes. Kindly state reason too for your suggestions for changing some order.",

Seniors will be able to better answer this.\n\nMoreover, CSE and CSE Cy have pretty similar courses up until the 2nd year, so... You won't lose anything and you also come under the umbrella of CSE if placements are what you are concerned about"
