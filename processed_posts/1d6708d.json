There is no way to say \"how much\" you need to score, since it depends on how the batch performs. If you are in CS, then usually crossing an 8.8 is enough to guarantee this scholarship. \n\nThere is another scholarship where branch toppers with the highest CGPA get more returns, but I have forgotten the %. So maybe someone else can fill in here."
