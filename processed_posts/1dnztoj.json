Might have increased by now but I don't think it's 4l per year. \n\nAs for your question, there are 2 scholarships available at PES. MRD and CNR Rao scholarships. \n\nIf you're in the top 2% of your batch in your CGPA (cumulative GPA), you'll get a 50% fee return.   \nIf you're in the top 20% of your batch in your SGPA (semester GPA), you'll get a 40% free return. \n\nThis is for both KCET and PESSAT\n\nApart from these two, there is a distinction award of some 1.5k if you get GPA higher than 7.5 as far as I know"
