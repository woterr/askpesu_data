  "content": "my mother is asking for the timetable as it has been released today, but i cannot show her the real timetable as she will expect me to come home as soon as college is done. so i am thinking of faking some of the classes and making it look like everyday is a full day. but in order to do this i need to know if she can see the actual timetable through the parents login in the app. PLEASE HELP ASAP",

Just be smart about it and come up with a solid excuse."

You can respectfully talk to them and assure them you aren't doing anything that will harm you. Make sure your grades are good. Sooner or later they will trust you more and they will give you the freedom you need."
