  "content": "So I was trying to quickly open a note on don'tpad during internals, and guess what?\nI got hit with three CAPTCHAs just to see my own text. ðŸ˜­\n\nThat was the moment I realized how fragile this quick-sharing tool isâ€”especially when you're under pressure.\nAlso, donâ€™tpad has no support for code indentation, so formatting python for ml is pain.\n\nI recently stumbled upon openpadz.live â€” it does the same thing but cleaner.\n\nYou can create notes at custom URLs, Proper code editor with indentation, Optional password protection for privacy, No annoying captchas (yet ðŸ¤ž)\n\nJust thought Iâ€™d share for those whoâ€™ve also been betrayed by don'tpad at the worst times",
