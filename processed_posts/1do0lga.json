  "content": "I am confused regarding the refund rules of PESU. During counselling, they told us July 5 to be the last date to get refund of program course fee of 4,80,000 if we withdraw our seat. This is what the important dates section on their site says as well\n\n||\n||\n|**July 5, 2024**|Last date for submission of original documents / Last date for surrender of PESSAT seat (only for admitted students)|\n\n  \nBut their site also says this-\n\n**Program Course Fee:** Any refund here will be done as per current UGC refund norms only.\n\nAnd the UGC norms are this-\n\n[https://www.ugc.gov.in/pdfnews/1654477\\_Fee-Refund-Policy-2024-25.pdf](https://www.ugc.gov.in/pdfnews/1654477_Fee-Refund-Policy-2024-25.pdf)\n\nIt says that Higher Education Institutions have to refund the entire amount up to 30 September 2024 and deduct not more than Rs.1000 up to 31 October 2024 if a students cancels his/her admission.\n\nCounsellings of BITS, etc. will still be happening after 5 July and if I'm able to get something better as per me in those, I would want a refund of the 4,80,000 from PESU. Will they give me that money back? And I know that those who get into IIT, NIT, IIIT will get a refund after 5 July as well, but what about colleges like BITS, etc?",
