Although your intentions are right, there is no fixed template for 9+ cgpa.\n\n If everyone replies with the usual study well, don't waste time around the campus, your question sounds very obvious and doesn't give off a good impression. So my opinion is to interact with everyone irl and see what everyone's doing. Then make changes accordingly and study well.\n\nI hope we can be classmates ahead(EEE fresher:) )."

I sound like such a nerd right now xD but I sorta need to change my branch in the second year if in case I don’t get it in the second round. Trying to be prepared mentally so that I’ll be able to actually execute it later on:)"

If you want to have a decent grade that is. \n\nAnd about backlogs, just work hard and you won't get them. If work is your main aim after college then don't have backlogs. Or else you can't sit for placements. \n\nAbout changing branch, unless you're in the top, then it's extremely extremely hard. \n\nJust say fuck it and go with the flow if you really want to come here. All the best :)"

If you compare yourself to others, you will feel very low and won’t be able to study. your grades will go down too. just know that this is a university and some people will be extra smart and be able to excel in everything even in extracurricular activities. don’t envy them , be happy for them and ask them for help if you need it.\n\nCompare your performance to your previous semester performance.  yes it’s a good idea to see where you stand with respect to others ,If you feel that you could have done better , try next time. But don’t feel bad just because some other person got better grades than you.                                                   \nbottom line: find out your true potential and use it to it’s maximum. Don’t over stress yourself cause if you do, whatever you could do before you won’t be able to in the future."

I guess even you should just learn it off now and not delay cause without knowing the basics, it’s very hard to solve problems."
