All placement emails are sent to both campuses at the same time, as part of the same thread (you can even see the recipients are both campuses). \n\nNot sure why people constantly trying to defame EC. Don't trust any information about campuses unless it's coming from this subreddit. There is a lot of misinformation out there."
