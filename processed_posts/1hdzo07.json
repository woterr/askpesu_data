I only managed to study one unit because I was very sick before the exam, yet I somehow still scored an A. The questions are straightforward, and most of the codes were from the slides. You’ll be fine as long as you can actually write basic codes and understand the logic.\n\n\nEPD: The numericals are often directly copied from the slides, and many of the same questions are repeated year after year. Going through the PYQs will definitely help.\n\n\nMath: I wasn’t great at it, so I’d rather not say much. Just make sure to practice as much as possible, from classwork, assignments, qb, tb, anything because the paper tends to be lengthy."
