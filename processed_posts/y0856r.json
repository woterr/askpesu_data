ECE people get some odd CS jobs so I don't think EEE here would be a great choice here if your concern is placements..But if your interest lies in electrical/electronics then you can go for it. Cuz here afaik only top1-2% of students from ece,eee,mech get the core jobs. Else most engineering students from the branches other than CS are placed in mass recruiting companies."

After the new internals system has been implemented , it has become very hectic. Adding to that there's 1440 cse students here(Rr+Ec) so competition is also very high. Managing other courses with  assignments,projects,ISAs,ESAs will be reallyyyy realllyyy tough"
