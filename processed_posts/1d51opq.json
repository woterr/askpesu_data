      "body": "1. Visit http://library.pes.edu (note that it's http, not https)\n2. Click on Search. \n3. Set the \"Title\" to the course code *without* the year. So if your course code is UE23MA101, just put MA101. This is to search for all papers for that course. You can also search using course names, but the issue with this is that the course names sometimes change. Since course code always remains a constant (hopefully), it's best to search using it. \n4. Don't set any other fields and press search. Choose whichever paper you want to view and click on Download. \n5. It will mostly ask you to sign in to download. You can sign in using your PESU credentials."

Then, you get a set of Question papers\n\nStep 6 - Click on **Download** on any of the papers you want.\n\nAll the best !"
