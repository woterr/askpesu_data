Do they help??? They ask ur cgpa and then tell that u wont get placed and at the same time she tells \" smile makhla, dont be tensed\". And hands over a paper where u write \" yeah all good with my life and my mentor helped me solving my problems\" as a fake record.\nTHIS IS BUSINESS, NOT EDUCATION.\nMANAGEMENT OF PES DOESN'T CARE ABOUT STUDENTS, THEY NEVER DID. ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS THEIR REPUTATION AND EGO.\nand i dare u to normalise the suicides happening in pes."
