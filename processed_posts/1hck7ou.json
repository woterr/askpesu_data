Don't stress over it. \n\nAnd yeah, T1 might not be the easiest but it's not impossible. Try to get it above 8 so that you can at the very least sit for most companies. 8.5+ is ideal though."

I have a friend of mine who got placed in consecure with a cgpa of 7.8 recently and i know a lot of them getting 10-11 lpa companies with cgpa around 7 and above. Since u say u can solve medium to high level dsa q's cracking the coding round would be easy. if not u can use ai to get ur answers and try to make sure u have a good resume as they usually shortlist based on it and shld be able to explain the projects in the interview round .If ur aiming for high t1 companies then u'll have to improve ur gpa to 8.5+."
