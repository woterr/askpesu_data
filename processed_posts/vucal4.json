      "body": "First off, 39/50 is really good so dont worry.   \nConsidering youre having the 50 internals 50 externals system, a 39/50, will mean that,   \nfor \n\nAn S grade, which is 87/100, youll need (87-39)\\*2 = 96 marks in ESA. \n\nAn A grade, will be around 75 or 77. Considering 75, youll need (75-39)\\*2 = 72 marks in ESA. \n\nA B grade will be around 65 or 67, Considering 67, youll need (67-39)\\*2 = 56 marks in ESA, and so on. \n\nThese numbers like 87, 75 and 67 are never hard limits, they always change based on your other peers, tough courses are subject to relative grading. Its usually around this much for an average difficulty level course."
