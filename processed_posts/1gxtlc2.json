I was thrilled and in awe when I saw one of the performances during this year's fresher's day and I’d love to connect with the metalheads here.\n\nI’m also a total beginner and I am interested in learning heavy metal guitar, although I have no prior experience in playing any musical instrument.I’d really appreciate it if you guys could teach me some basic stuff be it guitar or drums.",
