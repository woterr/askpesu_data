Specifically, I need:\n\n* **Flame sensor**\n* **Smoke sensor**\n* **Temperature sensor**\n* **Breadboard**\n\nIf anyone has these and is willing to lend/rent them, please let me know! I’m at **EC Campus** , so I can pick them up on campus. Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance! 😊",
