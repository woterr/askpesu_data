You can take summer courses and later drop equivalent special topics .\n2. Capstone Reviews, you will have around 4-5 reviews for which you have to be present physically .\n3. Placement tests, many companies will have their coding tests or interviews in campus which you will have to visit depending on the number of companies you apply to and when you get placed."

      "body": "You'll have no classes in 7th sem. You'll have to take up some nptel courses and study on your own at home. As for your capstone project, it depends on your domain and guide. Some guides will ask you to come to clg everyday, some will say 2-3 days a week and most will say u can do it at home. You'll still have to come for the ISAs and ESA for the courses and like 3-4 times a month to meet your guide. So you'll mostly be free the entire semester. 8th sem has nothing of the sort. They'll give you the whole semester free so that you can do an internship. The internship will count for 6 credits. Hope this helps :)"

You need to get your idea approved by them, you need to update your progress to them and they will be part of the panel that will conduct your review and give you your grades. Depending on your branch, you will either be assigned a capstone guide or you can choose the guide you want"

If you don't get an internship in 8th sem, you can do some online nptel courses and write exams in clg and claim the remaining credits that way"
