      "body": "If placements is your only goal go for PES .\nIf you want balanced college and academic life I would suggest BMSCE . BMSCE too has good placements but not upto the mark of PES yet but it is catching up.\nMy friends in bmsce say companies which come for hiring allow both cse and ise students. Syllabus wise there is a difference of few subjects and electives but the core remains the same. Overall I would suggest BMSCE(don't know whether you'll get it at 2700 rank in kcet)"
