These companies seem to be the regular ones that visit PES over the years. \n\nAfter seeing our current terrible placement scenario compared to the previous batch and still unplaced, I am starting to freak tf out. I want to get a good placement after paying so much fees :(",

They already say there overhired last yr(hearing it frm a friend).\n\nPaypal was offcampus and so is Cisco through hackathon.\n\nNvidia comes for intern only and hires very less like 1 or 2. \n\nJuniper came in October but this year they wont come. Theyll come as combined HPE hiring.\n\nWalmart came in september and November. VISA came in October.\n\nUnpopular opinion: In 2025 even though the best month of placement was August due to IBM hiring so much. But many of the best wellknown companies honestly came in Oct(end) to November time ngl.\n\nAlso eventually everyone gets placed. Its all about the time u get. Some maybe late, some early. So dont worry much."
