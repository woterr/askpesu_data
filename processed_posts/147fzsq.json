      "body": "In almost all cases, unpaid internships from tech companies cannot be redeemed for credits.\n\nBut as I said - submit for approval to your department since only they decide if it can be approved. There are a lot of factors that affect the approval decision like the tier of the company, what is the role you will be recruited for, other clauses in the offer letter etc. You never know, you might get lucky - although this is a long shot."
