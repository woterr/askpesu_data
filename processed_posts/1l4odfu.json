      "body": "Although what you said is true, you should also be aware that what happened last year was an outlier event, far removed from the normal expectation. Right from my own counseling back in 2018 up till 2024, the number of seats in the second round have almost always been at most 20-25 per branch. What happened in your intake was very unexpected and did not align with historical patterns. There were probably many external factors that worked to make it happen, nobody can explain with certainty.\n\nRegardless, my advice would always be to depend on generic historical data and not outliers. A starkly different outcome in one year does not invalidate the general trend."
