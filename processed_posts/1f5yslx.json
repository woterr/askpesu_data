  "content": "I live in Akshayanagar and ec campus is way closer than rr. Idk if I will get RR aiml or not in tmrw counseling ,but parents are telling to not take it because the campus is very far and the bus comes at 6:40 am to Meenakshi temple ( 1hr travel). Even from scooty it will take a long time becaz of the huge traffic. I don't know how I will stay back at the campus for club activities etc. as the commute is expensive and time consuming. I know rr campus is marginally better than ec but idk what to do in such scenario. ",
