You would have to talk to parents, and get some advice, etc. And if masters where? India or Abroad?\n\nConsidering what you said, I would say try to keep doing leetcode / codeforces & be consistent, watch youtube videos/take help from AI and practice nicely, and if u are really consistent and improve, you can prep for placements and also keep attending to companies that come. \n\nThat's all I can say :) Good luck"
