So, you shouldn't face any difficulty if you are comfortable with DSA to a certain extent. \n\nAs far as interviews are concerned, it doesn't matter what questions they ask you, your selection is entirely a matter of luck. They will aim to hire as many girls as possible, if you look at previous year's pattern. In the interview, I was asked fairly easy questions related to stack, some questions on my resume and some general cultural fit questions."
