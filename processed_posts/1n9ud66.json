      "body": "Not sure why you're getting downvoted, but you're right - if you get a T2 intern+FTE, it takes up 1/1 of your internship offer quota and 1/2 of your FTE offer quota. Assuming you *accept* this offer, you are out of placements and you cannot sit for any more companies. If you *reject* this offer, you are now eligible only for companies with T1 FTE offers, and you won't be allowed for intern-only or intern+FTE.\n\nAlso kids, this has already been discussed before. Search the sub, seriously. Its embarrassing if someone from the 2028 batch has a higher awareness of the placement policy than someone in the final year going through placements."

Similiarly, if you reject a T2 Intern+FTE IT u can also sit for T2 Core intern+FTE\n\n8) If u get internship which gets converted, you have the right to reject/accept it and sit for FTE as placement cell treats it as just as internship.\n\n\n\n\nThis was posted on Discord by a senior a couple of weeks ago.Fpund this comment under another post.The 4th one is it correct or wrong ,suppose I reject a Tier 2 fte+intern so I will br allowed to sit fir fte+intern of tier 1?"
