Save yourself the \\~3L every semester.\n\nQuoting my other [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/1daq7pd/comment/l7n7onf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button):\n\n>But to summarise, they are objectively as good as RR: same degree (campus is not mentioned on degree), same placements, same syllabus, same tests/exams and unfortunately also similar quality of average faculty. The only things different about the EC campus are subjective ones: smaller fests, not as fancy a campus as RR (but this is also because RR's current iconic building was constructed only a year ago and is brand new), and fewer clubs. However, it also has a couple of advantages over RR being a more spacious and open campus and a significantly better tech culture and CS clubs.\n\nFor more information, you can find a detailed comparison between the campuses on theÂ [FAQs](https://bit.ly/pesu-faq)."

They are students who show that they are way more than their CGPA.\n\nA good CGPA only opens up doors. Its up to you to walk through them."
