  "content": "I have already seen posts about curfew timings but they had all stated 9 but at the hostel briefing session, I was told that the hostel timings for the boys hostel were 7:30 only and that we'd receive 10 deviation points or something like that and a 100 of those would get us kicked out? I understand the gym and sports facilities closing by then but they mentioned that we'd need to be in the hostel, in our rooms by 7:30. Isn't that a little too early?",
