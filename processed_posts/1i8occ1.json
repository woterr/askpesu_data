Only saving grace is few COULD give attendance if yours is below 75.  \n2) Only one student recreation centre, which is always crowded anyway.  \n3) Cafeterias are overrated as fuck here. Always crowded, limited variety , at least compared to rr anyway, new mrd cafeteria is nice tho.  \n4) Very few fests and other cultural events. If thats a major thing for you then u wont like it here.  \n5) College kinda is lifeless after classes end.  \n  \n  \nFor what its worth, infra and the 'college vibes' at rr are much better than ec. Theres a lot of things to do for hanging around once college ends around the rr campus than ec.  \nFew things i liked  \n1) Literally no ragging  \n2) Seniors are mad helpful.  \n3) Teachers most of the time would respond to doubts and issues you have pretty quickly.( hope that doesnt change going forward)  \n4) Regular events, active clubs( fewer in number but theyre good from what ive heard).\n\nIf you really wanna come to pesu, visit both campuses ,explore properly. Try for RR anyway( so that u dont have fomo if u do join later)  \nagain, not some t69 college experience, just uh underwhelming ig."

If you're talking about the labs, worth mentioning ec has better research labs (quantum computing lab in mech block) idk about rr tho. Want to add that the fomo part will feel real but when you come out of the cutoffs delusion of 12th, it's really not that bad. EXCEPT THE DAMN COMMUTE EVERYDAY AAAAAAA"

Idk if they'll increase it again this year. All this tbh depends on your priorities, if you're okay with a relatively more academic 4 years in exchange for a hopefully and comparatively better placement, pes is good. If you don't care about all that and want to chill with not that much of academic pressure then bms is good as well. Though bms has 85% attendance and i have heard only the first year is chill."

Tho it's true that academic performance at rr is better than at ec, way more guys getting 9+ gpas there than here.\n\nThing is ull find all kinds of people here and there, kinda have to go and find your group. \n\nCheck out both infra at bms and here, maybe try contacting a senior or 2 thru linked in who's actually studying here for more than a year or 2.\n\nAt the end your mental peace matters way more. \nYour call."
