At the end of the day, there will be someone better than you at something. The only competition is your past self. Hang in there!"

Most of them are just as smart as you are. There'll obviously be some very brilliant people but most of your peers will be just as smart as you are. Just put in a bit kf hardwork and you'll score more than most of them. Stop lessening your morale and enjoy your first year"
