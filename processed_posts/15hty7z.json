Please use the search bar to find relevant posts, something similar was asked just yesterday.\n\nFrom your list, only Uber, Amazon, Apple, Adobe, Intuit recruit from PES. The rest either don't visit, or visit but don't select any candidates. \n\nThere is even a spreadsheet on this subreddit which contains the placement details for the 2023 batch. Please use it, we don't want this sub to get filled with duplicate questions."
