      "body": "Your experience will greatly depend on two factors: (1) the project you get assigned to and (2) the prof who advises you. Unless these two factors work in your favour, you will be in for a hard time. I was at CCBD and I got to work with KVS on an interesting problem statement that aligned (somewhat) with my interests. So we actually did a good bit of work and it was fun. Similarly, I know people who were unfortunate and didn't have a good prof/problem statement and were unhappy throughout the internship. Analogically, I've also heard anecdotes about the same at other labs like CDSAML and ISFCR. \n\nI've explained more on this in an old comment which you'll have to find, but to summarise, it's only worth it if you find a good alignment with the research being pursued and the prof. Else you'll not really have a good time. Look for what they're working on, the profs, the projects they're currently looking into (and what their past students worked on) and that will give you a good idea if you like the work. \n\nAre there benefits? Absolutely. A good research oriented LOR from a prof and a paper, if you do good work. But all this is possible only if your interest matches with what you're working on."
