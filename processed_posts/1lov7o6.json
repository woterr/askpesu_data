  "content": "So, is there anyone who got a seat alloted in PES in round 1 councelling of JEE mains and applied for refund from the institute? mention it so we can have a rough estimate for vacant seats in Round 2 jee main councelling... but in between there is PES KCET councelling and then after there will be JEE mains R-2 councelling for the left out seats... maybe there can be a chance since they closed the new registrations through jee mains also PES KCET fee is 5 lakhs per year so there is a chance for vacant seats in that as well because through Gov. KCET councelling fee is approx. 1 lakh and 40% seats are reserved for Gov. based KCET councelling and the 45% are for the jee mains + PES KCET councelling for which the fee is 5 lakhs.. so let's hope for the best. i have PES rank 13xx let's see if there is a chance for CSE in PES>?",
