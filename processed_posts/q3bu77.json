Placements are equivalent.\n\nFriend complained a lot about how they didn't get much free time and the like. I didn't have tonnes but I found that it was more than him at least.\n\nDon't think there's much of a difference between the curriculum in IS and CS as well."

      "body": "So I picked PES cs via pessat over RV ece and MSRIT/BMS cs via CET/COMEDK. For me the fees weren't an issue. I'd say take a call based on your financial situation. If the idea of spending ~15 lakhs for your bachelor's is too high, then you already have your answer.\n\nAs an FYI - there are scholarships where I think the return amount has been increased to close to 30-40%. That being said, since this is something you'll get after a sem, and you can't guarantee it beforehand, you shouldn't make a call based on it."
