The management changed 2-3 years ago and that's when all the good teachers started leaving the college. Plus the huge intake of students will affect your placements as you'll have more competition. PES could very well turn into VIT in some time. If I were you, I'd try for colleges like RVCE and BMSCE instead. \n\nThis is just my opinion but I'd highly suggest you do your own research. There are many similar posts answering your question on this subreddit.\nGood luck."

It's not all good, like any other college it has its pros and cons. Everyone can sugarcoat it but knowing the reality is why I assume you're on this sub. So all that's said here is true and you can weigh your options and decide."

Every One have a Time to retire everyone can't work forever they have to retire and that's the reason why some of the teachers left it's not because of management change For your Kind Information."

PES is gone to ruins. Only good college in the city rn is IIIT Bangalore. \n\nGo out of Bangalore to study, Bangalore's college game is honestly super disappointing. JEE/BITSAT do well and yeet."
