Pay depends on the company some pay like really nice money , most of them don't"

You already have a very sub par 12th marks , you can enjoy and score well in pes but you should know how to manage both of them. And looking at your marks I don't think you know how to do it. The semester exams are a little on the moderate to tough side so you should make the appropriate call for your future."

Until you hit summer internship season (summer after 3rd year), they will simply skip your application. \n\nStartups are different. They will pretty much hire anyone."
