There are thousands of people who are trying to get into PES with their JEE percentile and I don't think removing pessat will ease the cutoff for JEE entrance\n\n3. There were no recent changes in pessat. The last change was almost 9-10 months back\n\n  \n4. THE MOST IMPORTANT. TO ALL THE JUNIORS WHO ARE TRYING TO JOIN PES, DO NOT SPAM ABOUT YOUR PERCENTILE. DO NOT      do not      Do NOt     dO NOt spam"
