  "content": "A lot of people are applying for these internships over the summer. Due to my current cgpa I'm doubtful if I could get into any of these, and haven't applied so far. \n\nMy initial plan was pretty vague - just focus on improving dsa/web dev skills, projects. But I feel I should be doing more. How crucial is it to do these internships? What else could I do over the summer that might be useful, if not this?\n\nAny advice would be appreciated. Thanks! ",
