Not just \"aiml\" like some other colleges\n\nAlso the syllabus as of second year is almost the same. The only difference is 3 courses and they are the same as cs and some extra. \n\nNobody knows what the third year will be yet so i can't comment on that, but I'm hopeful that it won't be so different"
