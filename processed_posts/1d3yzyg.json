If the same repeats this year, you'll need to hope that only 19 kids show up between ranks 1 and 1180, such that you can get the last seat. Given that there's literally a thousand kids before you, it's unlikely that only 20 kids in those ranks will show up."

I will not recommend aiml until we properly know what the third year will be, but I'm sure it won't be that different or anything"
