Do Krithika slides and PESU academy, if u want more practice do textbook. 5th unit, actually we had a study material and everything came from that only (check if it's same with you peeps). Esa, 96/100 marks will be derivations+numericals even in ISA very less theory is asked  \n\n\nPhysics - Do Notes and Faisal sir's slides. It's a confusing subject, practice well and at least try to understand. First two units are very tough, but the next 3 not that tough, do well in the last 3 ISA if suppose you messed up to first or second ISA  \n\n\nI hope these tips might help you"
