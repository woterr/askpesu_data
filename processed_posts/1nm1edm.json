But honestly after a while I've noticed all this guy does is hate on EVERY post and discourage community discussion/enthusiasm just because he finds stuff \"cringe\".\n\nYou know mate, there's nothing wrong with not commenting when you have nothing relevant to contribute.\n\nIf there was some way to compile all his comments on this sub you would notice the negative pattern Im talking about."
