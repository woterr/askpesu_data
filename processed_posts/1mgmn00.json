What that bro?\n\nI been swimming through mud pools, fighting heat strokes and what not to get to clg and back.\n\nBut on a serious note, definitely lesser holidays than other colleges around and less forgiving. During the semester maybe around 10-15 days due to festivals, public holidays etc.\n\nAround 1-2 weeks after odd sem.\n\n2-3 months after even sem.\n\nCheck the FAQs once."
