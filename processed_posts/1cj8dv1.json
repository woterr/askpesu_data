Is the attendance or in person classes compulsory to attend?\n\nAlso if we get internship in this summer after 6th sem for 6 months can we do it and will college allow that?",

If you do not, then the remaining 6 credits are met through internship, or more courses.\n2. Classes in final year are usually online without attendance. \n3. You can do an internship, but remember that you are allowed a maximum of 2 credits (as far as I remember) from a summer internship. Nobody will stop you from completing the internship but you will not be able to claim full credit from it. Also, do not tell University that it is more than 2 months."
