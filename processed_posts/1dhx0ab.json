You can still have a lot of fun at pes I feel since it's all down to friend group\n\nAND ofc fees. It depends on how big a factor fees is for you. If you're okay with 5L, then Manipal and PES RR come back into the picture. \n\nThere are some v descriptive answers regarding manipal vs pes in this subreddit which you should go through."
