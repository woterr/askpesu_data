      "body": "Probably one of my most fond memories @ PESU would be attending his classes. He strikes a perfect balance between creating a fun atmosphere and teaching. To my surprise, many of the first benchers (nerds) never liked him because he would waste time instead of covering the syllabus. But it always happened that he would still finish the syllabus on time. Itâ€™s very easy to get carried away in his classes and feel math is very easy, because he makes it look simple. I have his handwritten M4 notes preserved and still use it occasionally xD, it was that simple to understand \n\nIf you guys are passionate about Fluid mechanics or physics of fluids, heâ€™s probably one among the top researchers in this area in Indiaâ€¦not many get a chance to publish in Journal of Fluid Mechanics multiple times in a year, but heâ€™s done that. Extremely fun and chilled prof inside and outside the classroom."
