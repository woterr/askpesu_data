Nothing is lost. it's just a matter of writing an apology letter, talking to the dean and apologizing. That's it. Everything will be just fine. Making mistakes and learning from it is what makes one mature. We are all learning. We are all growing. Relax. Inhale and exhale deeply. This too shall pass."
