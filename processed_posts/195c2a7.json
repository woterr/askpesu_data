      "body": "It will. A backlog means you have an F grade, which corresponds to a 4 point. When you clear a backlog, that grade improves and thus the credit point associated with it also. \n\nNote - as far as I know, you cannot score higher than a C grade in a backlog exam. So the 4 point can only increase to a 7 point at most."
