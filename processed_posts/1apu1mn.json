Sometimes not having web dev projects can be detrimental if the job role is of web dev(happened with me).\n\nI suggest just learn the basics and some two or three good full stack projects you still have time just make sure the projects are not that simple clones easily available on net.\n\n\n>I'm more focused on data science and ML\n\nIt's good but don't be particular on this. There are hardly any entry level roles in data science and ML for bachelors students.\n\nEven those that say ML engineer and Data scientist on JD will have you working on SQL  ,Pandas and Tableau. Instead of the core DS or ML.\n\nIf you are really serious about ML and DS get a masters from good university abroad or T-1 uni in India"
