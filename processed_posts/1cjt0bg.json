Yes, it is quite expensive and the food is just abysmal with only a singular option for a mess (whereas boys have 3 choices) , not only that the wifi is slow most of the time, the only good part about girls hostel is that it has a designated studying area, that boys hostel does not have and the curfew time is just 7pm, so a lot of restrictions have been put into place .  And Girls hostel is not inside the university unlike boys hostel, it's a few kms away across several areas (different blocks) and bus service from hostel to college (vice-versa) is provided."
