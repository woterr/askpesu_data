As far as I know there is no counselling process like rounds as such , you receive an email if you get the admission.  \n(This might have changed over the course of 2 years , so please verify it once )  \n\n\nThe important thing is , if you applied through PESSAT as well , please don't pay through your PESSAT seat first  \nSo what happened to me was  \nI had applied through Mains and PESSAT , and through PESSAT there was physical counselling .  So I attended the physical counselling where I was allotted AIML at RR Campus . I had to pay the fees on spot to block this available seat and be considered for further rounds of counselling . About 4.5L. The previous night at 2 AM , I had got a mail saying I got admission to PES CS at RR Campus and that \" I need not take part in PESSAT counselling now \". To my bad luck I read this mail after the physical counselling. But we weren't too worried , we thought we would sort it out with the management , saying I got AIML through PESSAT and CS through Mains ( both RR Campus) and we paid the fees for AIML , please switch our seat to CS. But nope , not only did the management disagree to our request ( we were not asking for a free seat , it was just a basic switch between two seats which I earned ) , but they treated us really badly , and the Admissions manager shouted at us for not reading the mail . Like they send the mail in the middle of the night and expected us to read it and come.   \nI hated the experience with PES , and decided to forgo both my seats at PES.   \n\n\nToday , I'm in second year in a different college  \n\n\nGood luck with your counselling process."
