The infrastructure is top notch but it degrades as one goes from the front to the back of the college .There are no trees or vegetation in the college except a few in the parking area.\n   2. The college, especially the auditorium gives one a very upmarket feeling which I believe is necessary for them to charge 5 lakhs yearly.\n   3. The long presentation before the counselling placed a huge emphasis on  the industry trends, changing job market and placements which is all PES is known for . They placed emphasis on the Bajaj and Kuka facilities at RR and EC respectively. They were trying to market PES> IIT BOMBAY 🤡. The seats for CSE at the RR campus were selling out like hot cakes which was expected considering the ROI of the branch . The highest ranker who attended ended up picking Biotechnology at RR which was noble of him to not impede others.\n   4. The staff were somewhat rude . Have visited many examination centers and the experience during Biometrics verification there  was much better there as compared to the counselling experience here. There are also a large number of uniformed bouncers all over the place restricting access all the time.\n   5. Sports facilities in the college are better than any of the colleges I was considering . There is a decent sized cricket ground with grass , football field , three basketball courts one of which is converted into a volleyball court and indoor badminton courts. There was a café coffee day outlet in a prime place of the college. Would have made this a post if not for the question and doubt only rule for the post heading."
