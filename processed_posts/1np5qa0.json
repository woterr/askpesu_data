      "body": "Depends on the reason. The process is generally very long.... if your reason is genuine, u need prior approval of missing isa. Usually if ur skipping isa due to major health issues(in some cases appealing after also works), conferences/representing college in sports.\nUr missed isa weightage is added to esa. lets say U missed isa 1, which is 20% of ur grade. esa is usually 50% of ur grade. so instead isa 1 is ignored and the 20% is added to ur esa weightage i.e 70% of ur grade.\n\nIf you missed due to some non genuine reason. Ull get zero.\n\nAlso there is no retest for isa"

I had a very valid reason (I was very sick) but I still had to go through a lengthy process of countless letters to HOD and head of examinations etc. \n\nThey ended up considering a higher percentage of the ESA marks for one of the subject. Overall it messed up with my grade so best avoid skipping any ISA."
