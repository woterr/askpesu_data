What is oop? Hmm the reason they didn't accept me is cuz they said my basics in c++ we're bad, I agree cuz I couldn't give proper definition I was always stuttering and the answer was overall messy,(they'll give the results the next day) also a heads up they'll call u asking for feedback and ask u personal questions I was not expecting that and cracked lol one of my hobbies were to read when she asked what author I froze up cuz for some reason no name was coming to my head"
