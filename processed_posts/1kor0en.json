Never have I ever agreed with the difficulty on a subject's paper with a cse friend, mutually exclusive difficulty all the time"

If you ask AIML folks, they’ll probably say  **CSE** papers looked easier to them too — it’s all about perspective.\n\nAlso, about the CN paper — not everyone even knew it was from last year’s ESA. And even if some questions were recycled, the paper was **challenging ... lengthy too..** not a free GPA boost. This semester’s ISAs weren’t exactly easy for us either. Every stream has its own struggles. Instead of comparing, let’s just focus on doing our best 🤝"
