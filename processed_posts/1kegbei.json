You struggle, scream, rant, warn, threaten, question, rebel, justify‚Äîand yet, nothing changes. \n\nTime? \nWhat about it?\nThe greens, blues, and purples will envelop you once more. Light will return, with darkness. It brings peace, quiets your soul. \n\nNo more frantic voices shouting, berating you.\n\n the ocean‚Äôs waves sweep  the sand away from the shore. Vigorously, against the calm shore. The wind hustles silently. The mosaic finally makes sense. It was all worth it.\n\nFollow at \n@ceruleanocean1 for more on twitter and threads",
