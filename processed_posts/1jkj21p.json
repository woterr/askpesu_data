  "content": "So, I was randomly scrolling through social media when I came across the name **Vikas Chinmay (J Section)**. Turns out, heâ€™s from *our own college* (PES)! What caught my attention? He published a book at just **20 years old**, and guess what? It was dedicated to his ex-girlfriend! Like, who even does that? ðŸ˜®\n\nOut of curiosity, I looked deeper and found that he even wrote another book called *\"Why This Degree?\"* (relatable, lol). And the craziest part? He never reveals his faceâ€”just his name. But I found out heâ€™s from **J section**.\n\nI read his book, and honestly? **Itâ€™s really cute and inspiring.** ðŸ¥¹ This guy seems super motivated, hardworking, and just different.\n\nBut letâ€™s talk about that ex-girlfriendâ€¦ **Ananya**, girl, what did you do?? ðŸ«  How did you let go of someone like him? He literally sounds like a dream.\n\nAnyone else heard about him? Or is it just me going down this rabbit hole? ðŸ‘€",
