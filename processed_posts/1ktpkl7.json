  "content": "Hello! I recently finished my 12th and am looking forward to join a good college with good placements in EEE OR ECE courses...and I came across PES university. Can someone please let me know more details about these courses specifically in PES? Like what sort of subjects do they teach? (I want the names in detail) because I went through MSRIT's courses and they provide a lot of info regarding what they teach. Ive always heard PES has good placements, but I wanted to know about the courses and subjects they teach. \n\nMy counselling is nearing and im panicking on what to choose.\nIt would help me Gajillions if someone helped provide this info üò≠üôè",
