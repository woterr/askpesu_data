      "body": "You believe in nirf ranking ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚....amity university has better ranking than nit trichy lol. And I am not saying people are not getting placed. I am saying that what you hear about high salary placement.. Only a fraction of student receive it. Even I came to this college thinking about placement....that too from far north so I can understand what you mean to say. \nAnd if you have already taken admission then congrats and dont listen what others have to say about college because you cannot change anything now. What's done is done...so enjoy your stay here.\nBut if you are still in 12th then I want to say you try to have other option as well.\nPlacement and all still depend on you. If you are interested in your subject you will get good placement.\nBut the real problem is the management. They are the real assholes.\nYou cant even imagine how much they fucked our mental health during pandemic. And they will bully you whenever possible. This is the main reason I hate pes and I dont want junior to make the same mistake I did."
