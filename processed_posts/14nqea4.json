      "body": "Most people go purely by the placement perspective :)\nBms follows the VTU syllabus which is pretty (very) crap. Idk about ramiah honestly, most adults don't seem to like the vibe surrounding ramiah. Pes is known to be strict and stuff.\nIn all honesty get in touch with seniors from each college and ask them , random people will just feed you their own bias , just like I did xD"

      "body": "Yes, PES is stricter and more workload, but you'll learn to live with it.\n\nIt provides you with more internship opportunities, more project opportunities, on graduating much better placements and if you're looking to do further studies a degree from PES puts you in very good standing.\n\nBMS and Ramaiah just like any other college in Bangalore don't even conduct exams on time. PES will ensure you get a summer break from mid May to mid August which opens up so many opportunities to do internships."
