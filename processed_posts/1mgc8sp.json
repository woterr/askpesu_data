  "content": "im about to join pes rr campus and had a few questions about the hostels. the boys hostel curfew was told to be 7 30 in the briefing session. is this timing followed by students or its also one of the rules only in the rule books and never followed. cause most other hostels have curfews at around 10 pm and 7 30 feels too strict",
