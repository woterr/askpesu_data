  "content": "TLDR : applied for mca interview,rejected due to technical and skill issue üíÄ) mailed college if I can try again but they said no but I can technically apply again with a different email will that get me blacklisted?\n\nI applied for MCA and I got rejected (The interviewer couldn't hear me properly and I tried my best to be loud and another thing is apparently I gave only like 2-3 lines explanation and i'm supposed to answer stuff in detail)\n\nMy friend says apply again the worst thing that can happen is you lose 1200 rs but my bro said i might get blacklisted if I do cause I already applied once \n\nOr should I go directly to college and ask for management seat (everyone says management seats are there they just never tell how) or just wait for pgcet? \nWill doing this stop me from getting admission through pgcet also?\n\n",
