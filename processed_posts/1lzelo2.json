  "content": "I recently gave an OA for the flipkart grid challenge on hirepro and it did not allow python. Only C, Cpp, Java, Go were allowed. This really threw me off since I mainly do dsa in python.\nI don't want language compatibility to be an issue for any sort of college internship/placements OA. Should I switch to cpp or just stick to python? (Is it only a flipkart/hirepro thing or does it happen in other OA's as well, mainly college one's).\nI've only recently started dsa so I don't mind switching if it's for the better.\nI'll be starting my 5th sem next month if it's relevant.",

In the remaining time spend time exploring what language suits you the most, and as soon as you get it start doing dsa. It can be at any time l."

And the other two questions you could choose any language. So it goes both ways. Safe way is to have 1 language as backup. Most people go with python and c++"
