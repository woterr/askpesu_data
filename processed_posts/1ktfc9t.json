Honestly my friend in rv seems to be having it quite hectic, exams are easy but random assignments and shit. \n\nOverall dont expect some movie type life, its still fun tho ( depends on ur friends)."

      "body": "Kinda true i'm more on the nerd-ish side and have a few small social groups but I've had my good share of clubs & other stuff happening, a lot more which I tried to do. I told this after seeing some of things you have mentioned, and if you really want those you won't be able to do them without feeling hectic.\n\n> Most probably i will be joining rvce or pes(rr) circuital branches,but bcoz of this jee prep of 2 years it has been 0 social life and hectic \n\nPES will be hectic. Especially for a lot (not all, and you might be one of them) of people in their 1st year as you try to get used to the system. EEE seems more chill than ECE, with ECE ppl seeming to be more dead after exams :) \n\n> which one is better wrt social life,fests,work load,baddies (not a perv). I am a day scholar pes is closer to me thru metro ,i know pes comes after rvce in placements but placements diff will not matter but 4 yrs should be better .which one RV or PES?\n\nI'm not sure of the social life RV, but PES can give a variety of options depending on your friend group(s). Many people have high GPA and good lives, many don't and many in-between.\n\nFests/clubs, PES has them better even though the support and quality is varying/lower compared to a few years ago. \n\nWork load, both will give you work just maybe in different areas for different stuff. Can't really escape work if you want to be a good engineer.\n\nBaddies: Every batch seems to get hornier. No further comment.\n\nTransportation, seems like you have figured out both routes so uoto you.\n\n> And i am a sportsman ,will they encourage if a student plays national or states and will they give attendace?\n\nUsually most of the sports people are in BBA. An F4 driver, U19 cricket captain, etc. Doable, yea probably. But you'll also need to spend time practicing. You might not enjoy clubs (both tech & non-tech), subjects, or whatever you want to do as much with so many things planned. I'm not a sportsman, but I did want to do a lot more. I did some things, wished I could to do them better, but now I'm doing good. And more money & time to do those missing things now than when I was busy & broke with college. I'm not sure of how RV is, but wouldn't be surprised if its similar-ish. In the end, its upto the individual to see if they can balance GPA, interests, time, mental wellbeing despite external factors wanting to ruin all of them"
