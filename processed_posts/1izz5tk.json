It's not even about scoring, it's about how they set the question paper. Id get 38/40 anyday on the paper AIML people got. CS everyone was shitting except some bookworms."

Figure out why you didn't do as well: could be because you didn't paper sufficiently at the level required to answer those questions, or you didn't even know those topics, or anything else.\n\nWhat's the point of blaming PES for setting a difficult paper? They've always been known to set harder papers than necessary. Can't do anything about it except prepare accordingly. \n\nDon't pick on a fresher irrationally. Think rationally about why you didn't do well and then work on it. Mocking people for their JEE scores is irrelevant here."
