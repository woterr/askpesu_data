It takes in your manager's contact details, your offer letter etc. They will then contact your manager and ask them to fill out a feedback form which will ask them to rate you across several parameters from technical expertise to soft skills. PES then maps this rating to grades. \n\nUnless you are pursuing an internship which is not approved by PES, you will get as many credits as per the set guideline (if I remember correctly it's 3 weeks of work = 1 credit)."

Internship credits reflect only in the 8th semester because that's the \"internship\" semester and they'll list out all the internships and corresponding grades in that semester's grade sheet. So your manager will have to fill out the evaluation form now and their response will be used to generate a grade, but you probably won't get to see it on your transcript until your final semester (or at least I don't think there is a way to see it beforehand?)."

You can use the average to determine your grade (10->S, 9->A and so on)\n\nOf course, this depends on your relationship with your manager."
