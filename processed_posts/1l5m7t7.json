      "body": "Judging your peer group based on JEE rank is very biased. Once you join, you will find a mixed bag of people: people with very low JEE ranks getting 9+ CGPA and also people with high JEE ranks struggling to cross an 8 CGPA. You cannot use JEE/PCM scores to project how your batch will perform. Odds are, if you are interested and have a genuine passion for your branch, you will do really well in it, regardless of whatever you scored in JEE.\n\nThe reason people prefer RR over EC has been documented in the FAQs. Please read and educate yourself."
