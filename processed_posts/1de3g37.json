We attend both. \n\nWe have events almost every weekend. Sometimes there are more than one. As a club head/organiser, you'd struggle to find good dates to conduct your events on. \n\nYes, PES does focus more on academics and some professors give you trouble but it's not true that you'll be required to study 24/7 and you won't have time for anything else in life."
