Bootstrap is a week-long period during which on each day you will get to explore each branch by carrying out simple and fun activities (if you are in CS, you will still have to explore other branches). It isn't mandatory to attend but serves as a fun icebreaker to meet batchmates and seniors.\n\nNormal classes will begin after bootstrap. There won't be anything special and you will have normal classes from day 1."

You'll meet your classmates and paint schools with them üê∏ \nOther than that the college campus is, well I don't like how it looks üòÇ.
