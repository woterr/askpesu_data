But you essentially just take the documents to the admission department (MRD building, RR campus) along with other admission related documents they might have given you (like the acknowledgement) and they just take it. You can go alone too."

      "body": "Went today. It was relatively an easy process. You go inside MRD building,the receptionist will be sitting on the left, ask for documents submition, she'll show you the way.\n\n\nThe first thing they'll ask you is, the acknowledgement form (which they gave during the Counseling). And ask for the remaining documents, which you didn't submit during counseling. They'll tell you to sign under the copies (self attested). And that's it. They'll keep it in a file.\n\n\nAlso make sure to bring the ID card, even though it's just for them to know your rank through pessat. I didn't bring mine, but had a photo of it, and they said it's completed.\n\n\nAlso they mentioned that, If you are going to study in EC campus, make sure to get those originals after the completion of first year.\n\n\nWhen I went, It wasn't crowded and the process took less than 5 minutes.\n\n\nAlso, you can go alone."
