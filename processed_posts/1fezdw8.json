I haven't met a single non-management person in both campuses who gave a flying fuck. \n\nDon't get demotivated that you didn't do good in 12th, it doesn't mean you won't do good in college. \n\nCollege is a completely new thing, though the people who did well before tend to continue doing well in college i have seen so many people who turn their lives around. For better or for worse. \n\nJust make sure that you do it for the better"
