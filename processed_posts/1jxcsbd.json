  "content": "I‚Äôm in 4th sem right now and I swear college just keeps getting worse. I used to be a decent student but this sem has completely killed any interest. My marks are shit, my teachers are honestly so bad, the college environment in general is soul sucking and depressing. I‚Äôve lost all motivation to attend classes or do assignments andd projects, and Im not able to study anymore.\n\nSome of my teachers have started calling me out and scolding me for my performance dipping and for not listening in class, but i dont even seem to give a fuck anymore\n\nIs anyone else feeling like this? I'm not qt all. excited about going to 5th sem with capstone and the pressure of getting a summer internship. I don‚Äôt think I can handle it",
