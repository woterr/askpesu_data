      "body": "Doesn't work like that unfortunately. All courses you take up during your BTech are mandatory courses, which means you must pass in all of them to get your degree. To meet the credit requirement for your degree (160 credits), you also need to take up a certain number of special topic courses. These are offered during the semester from 2nd year onwards, the summer breaks and your 7th and 8th semesters. At the end of 8 semesters, unless you take up the required number of special topics (which btw you need to actively do on your own since PES does not auto enroll you into any), you won't be eligible to graduate. \n\nThese summer courses are effectively special topics. They don't replace any other mandatory course. Taking them up early simply reduces the number you need to take up later, freeing you up in your final year to focus on placements/higher education applications."
