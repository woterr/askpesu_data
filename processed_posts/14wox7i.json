  "content": "So i have done the ds course  which was done in college, i was able to follow the classes pretty well, do the assignments on my own without much problems. But the problem i face with c is its very hard to do any string manipulation type for questions and although i did code pretty well in my 3rd sem(the class codes and assignment  codes), but when it comes to leetcode i have solved very few questions..so is it advisable  to continue in c or switch to c++ for dsa only?\nOr should i do it in any other language like java or python?",
