      "body": "They changed the names of the scholarships about a year or two ago. So you would find conflicting information.\n\nLet's just call them the 'big scholarship' and the 'small scholarship'. \n\nThe small scholarship was formerly called MRD scholarship. It is now called CNR scholarship.\n\nThe 'small scholarship' provides you a 40% fee return given that you're above 8.5 GPA (afaik) and in the top 20% in the branch according to your Semester GPA (SGPA). This would translate to roughly 8.5\\~8.6 above. \n\nThe big scholarship was formerly called CNR scholarship. It is now called the MRD scholarship\n\nThe 'big scholarship' provides you a 50% fee return given that you are in the top 2% of your branch according to your Cumulative GPA (CGPA). This translates to usually 9\\~9.1 above."
