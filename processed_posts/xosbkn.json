A minimum of 10-12 marks are fixed for the application based questions and the others would be the basic theory oriented ones. It isn't really hard to get 12-15 in ISA if you have a decent amount of prep (At least studied everything before the day of exam) or if you have listened in class. Some subjects will screw you over and some will seem very easy. Just try to study every concept so that you can answer be a little familiar with it (Could give an intelligent guess too).\n\nI don't know about the other streams though but my advice is just be decently prepared for ISAs and try to do as well as you can. ISA scores really help you at the end of the semester. You can even bank on them when your ESA goes bad.\n\nSince you are looking for a branch change, its better that you study properly for every ISA/ESA and try to the assignments/projects really well. At the end of the day, the SGPA you secure is what is going to help you change branch.\n\nAll the best for your ISAs!"
