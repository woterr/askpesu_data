  "content": "Just as the title says, how many backlogs can someone have? I enrolled but I went through a surgery and didn't really go to college. Missed through my first year classes and exams and rarely met my professors, I can't contact COE. I tried emailing and calling but no one responded. I can't go in person cuz I'm still recovering and I got no family that I talk to. I can't afford to restart the whole thing again. I'm supposed to write first semester backlogs in July. Since I haven't fully recovered, I was thinking if I could write this later? Since I have two semesters with 12 subjects ( 5 subjects+ lab). And when do they usually held exams in July?",

And you have to clear the backlogs since they're required courses. \n\nYou can check the FAQs for more details on backlogs, when they can be cleared, etc."
