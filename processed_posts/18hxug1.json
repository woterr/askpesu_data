  "content": "I don't have a capstone team nor do I have an idea in mind. I also don't want any specialization. I was thinking of taking AIWR and DBT, but it looks like those subjects won't be as useful as Image Processing, TDL, NLP etc. in capstone. What would you ppl recommend?",

You don't *need* any elective to understand things for your capstone. My capstone and my electives have 0 things in common. \n\n3. Take the electives that interest you. Check the syllabus. Some of your electives were not offered to us so see the teachers and syllabus to decide."

As far as electives go they do help you a bit if your topic is related to them, but you can always learn them later. Choose the elective which interests you the most and remember the teacher makes a huge difference in the electives so choose wisely."
