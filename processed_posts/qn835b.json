  "content": "Hello everyone. Our cet counseling began and option entry has started.\nShould I prefer the newly introduce course(AI/ML) at RVCE over CSE at Pes? I asked a few seniors at RV and they said they don't have much info regarding the course as it's starting this year.\nI also enquired with Pes seniors and it was a mixed response - 1) AI/ML would be very much in demand in the future+ RV tag\n                   2) I'll be the first batch so we don't know how it is in RV. A safer bet would be CSE at Pes.\n\nIm in a dilemma now. Any advice would be helpful guys! \nThanks",
