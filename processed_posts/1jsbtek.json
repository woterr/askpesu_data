At first I thought she maybe needed directions or lost her friends or something. Nope. She was trying to chat. Like, actually chat.\n\nShe starts asking me what year I'm in, and immediately I‚Äôm like‚Ä¶ red flag? Why does that even matter? I tell her I‚Äôm a first year, thinking that would kind of end the convo, and she just got all awkward and dipped.\n\nWhich‚Ä¶ honestly, thank you?\n\nSuper weird energy overall. Felt like I was getting interviewed for something I did not sign up for. 10/10 would not recommend. Not sticking for longer time from next event onwards.",
