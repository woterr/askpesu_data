      "body": "I haven't yet gotten admission but i chose Christ bcus christ is one of the best college for Psychology.Its one of the demanding courses in Christ so there is alot of competition to get a seat.From the people i have talked to they have said its hectic and its depends person to person if they can cope up.They expect you to take part in both academics and extra curriculars.You can check out the r/Christ University subreddit for more info.In Bangalore,Mount Carmel is a good alternative.If you are looking outside Bangalore too then delhi University,St Xavier's mumbai, Fergusson College are good alternatives too."
