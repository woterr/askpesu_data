      "body": "Do both? It should not be too hard to go from 8.3 to 8.5 in 3 sems. Many also have around 8.75 or 9 cutoff. I would say it‚Äôs not mutually exclusive anyway, a lot of the 4th sem subjects like OS, CN, DAA are useful for placements too so learning them well is 2 birds with one stone. Beyond focusing on class, you mostly only need to study well few days before exams, so you should have enough time for dsa and projects"

(Personally experienced this when my gpa was just sub 9 and they rejected me for OA)  \nHigher GPA doesn't hurt ... but try to grind dsa along with it"
