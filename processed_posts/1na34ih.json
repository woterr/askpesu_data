  "content": "i am a fresher at pesu cse branch . its hasnt been a week here and i am already struggling in understand how to study for stuff . parents **expectation is like 9+ gpa** but i dont understand how do you really learn stuff\n\n  \nMost people said **notes and slides** from pesuacademy which is a lil inconsistent as in school there were always physical books but its fine i will get used to it . the major problem i am facing is **where to solve questions from** and looks pyqs are one thing but i am on literally first unit and esa pyqs dont have many questions\n\nteachers also only do **few questions in class and there is like 1-3 questions in the question bank at pesu academy** which many times dont even have the correct answer key correspondingly\n\n  \nany kind of help would be appreciated and if you could mention **active study hours** , it would be even better . ik study hours diff for diff people but still ..\n\n\n\nThanks :)",

      "body": "Okay this is quite normal and this is how I exactly felt at first..\nIll list out resources and study methods which is quite enough to get an S grade in that sub..\n\nPhy: Faisal slides the holy Gita for phy, study everything line by line and solve all the numericals from those slides, read the pesu notes side by side, remember every formula. Do this first, then solve the question bank and pyqs (mainly the last 2 yrs), the isa papers will mostly have derivations and numericals in the 4 markers so do practice properly..\n\nEEE: The easiest subject in p cycle (this had the highest average in p cycle), for this do slides both pesu academy ones and one more is the krithika slides, all the questions in both isa/Esa come from them, not the same but of the same pattern, no need to study notes and qb for this, do listen to class coz you will understand this as it mostly has continuation of 11/12th.. \n\nMechanical: Lmao the shittiest of all the subs, for this you have to mug up slides, in isa1 youll have 2 numericals and 2 theory and for isa2 youll only have theory so prepare accordingly, just mug up every fucking thing, you are also expected to write diagrams so start studying this sub like 3 weeks before your isa or else you getting fcked \n\nMath 1 and Math 2: Solve all the CW questions, and qb (both are necessary so dont skip) \n\nPython and C programming: This is smtg yall will figure out on your own, yt/documentation/slides/notes do what works out for you..\n\nChem: This do slides and pyqs, (requires some mugging up but not as horrible as mechanical) this is sufficient fot both isa/Esa (questions will be straight forward)\n\nMechanics: Solve banana and orange for isas, orange and jackfruit for esas. Again a very straight forward sub (had the highest average in c cycle)\n\nEpd: Do slides and pyqs, again and very straight forward sub"

Thats why I said find ur groove and stick to it lol.\n\nDin use any physical book till date but always had the material soft copies I referred to... all of them that were given in slides only."

(this takes lot of effort) but if u can do this for atleast one subject u can easily score S , by just revising it for 1-2hrs the day before the exam.\n\nIf you can do this for more subjects , that is great , but I feel every class has one good teacher."
