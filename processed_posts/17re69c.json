Have a look at how your peers have performed and how the class has performed as a whole , that should give you some idea as to what should be your next steps .\nPs: don't sit and think relative grading will save your ass , it may or it may NOT"

However I will also add that scoring less doesn't mean you are below par or whatever.. after first year just 60% are above 7.75 gpa , also make use of your time judiciously during the first year learn ,play and enjoy.. going ahead you will have no time."

So don't worry, you can always improve with time! \n\nOne ISA doesn't doom you to losing 8.5 forever. More than a year of bad marks can do that."
