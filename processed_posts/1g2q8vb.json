Incompetent staff and teaching, Maybe one of my biggest regrets choosing the exemptions and the course in this college. You will be on your own with no one to listen and help, struggling to somehow perform decent. So according to me try not to consider this course in this university. ",

The teaching is bad when it comes to few subjects and the dean is least interested about students concern. The program is structured in a worst way possible making it difficult for students to attempt the non exempted papers and no support from college is provided for the students taking exam."

It is very evident that the ACCA students need laptop and we even don't get to a class room where we have charging points and we all have our ACCA exams in CBT mode.... How does this even make sense by not providing the students with basic amenities required..... And they try to justify this"
