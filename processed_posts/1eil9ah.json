      "body": "I think your goals are not set correctly. If your goals are not set properly, and you aren't putting in effort towards your goal, a lot of time and money will go wasted. Think correctly and don't float from career to career without setting goals. \n\nIf your health is good, then work towards your career goal. The career goal should be such that at the end of it, you should be able to generate wealth so you can become independent and take up further responsibilities.\n\nComing to your question, having 6 backlogs isn't good. But clearing them is achievable if you put your mind to it. Make sure you have no more backlogs in the coming years. Immerse yourself into study. Take help from parents, teachers, mentors and fellow students. Maintain relationship goal by showing gratitude to all the people who helped you achieve your goals."

      "body": "Honestly, it's completely upto you. It's not too late to quit, but you can definitely clear all your backs and get a decent cgpa by sem 6 if you grind properly before the exams. I am in ECE and had 9 backs before sem 3 and 14 overall and I was able to clear almost all of them by sem 8. AIML subjects will be way easier dw. This is not a bad time to quit, but you have to consider your other options as well. If you have a better and more chill college ready, you should probably go for it. Most other colleges are way less stressful than PES and usually more chill. It's better to just cut your losses with the 11 lakh than spend like 45 lakh and be miserable for 4 years. But if this is your only option, you can definitely make it work, though your cgpa will be a bit on the lower side. College shouldn't feel like a chore and if you have better options than PES I'd 100% recommend it"
