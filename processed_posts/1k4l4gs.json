ESA was quite difficult for chem cycle ppl(It did not come like the pyqs) so don’t just go off pyqs while studying for it, you have to do everything completely. Also remember there is nothing like important topic or etc.(They asked questions from random-ass topics). \n\n\nSo TLDR is yes it’s possible but will require massive changes in prep strategies and a lot of effort\n\nFor refrence I pulled a similar comeback myself :)"
