  "content": "Hello all I just feel I cant handle this . I have really fucked up my scores and feel so unworthy rn . I put all the efforts and studied for exam but still i could just reach avg. infact below average. I'll be getting around 6 gpa or even lesser . I srsly have no idea what to do people say the 1st sem is easy if i cant do easy one idk what my situation would be in other semester. 6 gpa is rlly fucked up cuz even tho i end up doing my 2nd sem which is c cycle good the cgpa would still be low . I dont feel good about it i just feel like a loser everyone around be are doing so good even tho i put lot of  efforts i just cant reach to that level . Is there any way where you can rewrite a particular subject exam again even tho you have passed it just to improve the scores . i just want to have atleast 8.75+ cgpa by the third year 😭 now its feels practially impossible given that my 2nd yr course is even harder as i heard people saying about it. Ig its over for me 😭😭😭😭. Didnt think i end up this kinda situation in 1st sem itself.",

      "body": "On my way to collect downvotes but here's the harsh truth (which was already mentioned before your semester began and also documented in the FAQs, but I shall reiterate): \n\nAcademics here aren't easy. It's rigorous, tough, hectic and difficult to score well. Exams aren't free passes and will really test your understanding of the concepts. Last minute prep is simply not sufficient, so forget all those college stories of people studying overnight. They are a challenge to most people. And finally, for a high grade point in a course, you have no choice other than doing well in every single component, from assignments to ESAs. And here's the worst part: it's only going to get worse from here.\n\nYou're going to have to put in not just hard work, but consistent hard work. The people who score the highest GPAs are people who put in moderate amounts of effort *throughout* the semester. But before you put in hard work, you need to sit down and figure out why you didn't do well. Analyse your mistakes, introspect what went wrong for you and what changes could have made it better, and what can you change. Find a study pattern that works for you. And once you figure that out, keep working hard. There's no other alternative here. \n\nJudging by the number of \"oops I fucked up\" posts in the last 24 hours, the only thing I can say is that you guys seriously underestimated how difficult the ESAs would be despite the numerous warnings provided and simply didn't put in enough efforts throughout the semester or even at the end to do well. Start taking these seriously. There's only so many more \"I will comeback next sem\" before you reach 6th sem. Beyond that, even if you get a 10 SGPA, the damage has been done. Pull up your socks, get serious about academics, understand that you are lacking somewhere and figure out how you can improve. \n\nGood luck."

Trust me, it becomes way better in next semesters. You start getting a hang of these things and start scoring better. \n\nI got only 7 in the first year, but my fourth year it went up to 8.7 (I don't remember the exact number).

      "body": ">Quality of students been decrementing post Covid and all and that comparing with seniors our scores are really shit\n\nI had posted graphs from my batch's ISA scores on PESU Discord after your final ISA scores were released, go check it out. Yes, you can see that as a batch, we did significantly better, our averages were almost +10 more than yours. \n\nI'd say the main difference between previous batches and yours is that since you all went through the COVID phase during your important school years, most of you got used to studying from quick formats like PPTs which don't often help learn concepts thoroughly and are meant for revision. Most of you are very avoidant of reading the book or preparing thoroughly for an exam and would rather choose a resource that helps you cover the syllabus the quickest rather than a resource that covers the syllabus extensively. \n\nOn the other hand, my batch had to depend on the textbook, notes you write in class and online videos to learn concepts. For most courses at PES (atleast until 4th sem), reading the book and solving the exercises in them became a part of the learning process. During ISA/ESA, you'd see people show up with photocopies of the textbook (which were sold at campus mart) or soft copies on their phone. From my experience, I can say that this led to people having covered 100% of the concepts for the topics they did decide to learn thoroughly, instead of learning everything at the surface level. \n\nOf course: PPTs, lecture notes etc have definitely made life much simpler. Back then if you didn't write notes in class, you were in trouble. Now, a lot of it is spoonfed. I believe that you all need to grow out of this spoonfeeding and go back a few years to how things were done. Read the book, solve the questions, study everything there is on those concepts. Then use the PPTs to revise before tests. It's not about covering the syllabus the quickest. It's about actually learning what's there so you can apply it, something that is especially important for higher semesters."
