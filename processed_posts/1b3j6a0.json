But trust me, if you are confident, and prepare well enuf, or even just enuf to crack an interview of a specific company. U r good to go.\nI had a gpa of 3.9 in my first sem.. 4 pointer in 3rd sem. \nAnd at your stage, after end of 6th sem, if am not wrong, i was just under 6 .5cgpa. With one pending backlog. \nI thought its all fucked up now, since i still had a pending backlog coming into rhe final year. \nAnd i couldn't attend most of the interviews since i cudnt even clear the criteria of gpa.\nBut i had confidence in myself.\nAnd finally i cleared my back during 7th sem exams. And i could clear the interview within the second company i sat for \n\nDuring my 7th sem, when i still had that backlog i attended an interview for one of the big 4 consultancy. And i cleared 2 rounds and got eliminated in the final round.\nIf not for my weak resume,  i reckon i could have got placed in that company itself. nevertheless, i got placed in a pretty gud company, and especially with the academic record i had, i was more than satisfied with what i got.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that, if you have a low GPA it'll definitely affect ur placement opportunities, but only for the top companies or i can say 10-20% of the companies. \nIf you've maintained a gpa above 7, ur good to go... For 80% of the companies.\nAnd if you could back yourself with a strong resume and actual skills, with a confident attitude and a bit of luck going ur side.There's no one stopping u from getting placed.\n\nBcz if i got placed , anybody can get placed. Didnt have a strong resume, neither top notch english skills, nor a good academic record.\n\nBut but but, give ur best shot for ur oncampus placements. Bcz once i get out, for the offcampus, its extremely competitive and not at all ez to get placed without actual talent."

You still have plenty of time to go to 7+ by end of 6th sem. Try your best to have interest in the subjects. Most of them are very realistic and not a waste of time. \n\n- Make your resume look appealing. Go to hackathons/ volenteer at events. Make a side project that you are proud of. Put yourself in the shoes of a recruiter and think what else you need. Don't try to achieve everything. Just make sure to slowly improve day to day. \n\nDM if u want to know anything else. Keep in mind I am from 2024 batch so I'm not very upto date."
