Usually there are makeup classes after all the ISAs end. If you can cover up to a satisfactory degree they'll let you write the ESA, else you're kinda screwed."

Don’t stress too much, you’ll likely be called and asked why your attendance is this way, produce medical certificates and you’ll be fine. Take part in club activities or something to claim attendance."
