  "content": "Dear male humans of PES, \n I've seen a couple of posts about this, so this is a public service announcement for those of you who still think talking to a girl requires a PhD in psychology or divine intervention\n\n1. Be hygienic and dress properly.\nThis is an obvious one, but a lot of guys seem to fail at it. Clean clothes, combed hair, and maybe a shower. Appearance matters to everyone regardless of gender.\n\n\n2. Don‚Äôt approach when she‚Äôs busy.\nIf she‚Äôs on her phone, with friends, or looks like she‚Äôs in a rush, don‚Äôt barge in. Wait for a better moment.\nIf she‚Äôs talking to someone else or wearing earphones, don‚Äôt bother.\n\n\n3. Talk about something relevant.\nIf you're in the same class, talk about class. If you‚Äôre both in the same place, mention something related to that. Keep it natural.\nSome topics could be:\n\nUpcoming exams or assignments (if you‚Äôre in the same class)\n\nEvents happening around campus\n\nMutual friends or acquaintances\n\nSomething interesting you both might have seen recently (like a movie or a TV show)\n\n\n\n4. Don‚Äôt text endlessly.\nIf she‚Äôs not replying, stop texting. Don‚Äôt flood her chats like some desperate idiot. If she wants to talk, she‚Äôll respond.\n\n\n5. Observe body language.\nIf she‚Äôs avoiding eye contact, leaning away, or looking uncomfortable, don‚Äôt be a dumbass and keep pushing.\n\n\n6. Don‚Äôt get too close too soon.\nStart with simple conversation. No ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so cute‚Äù or ‚Äúyou‚Äôre like a sister‚Äù stuff. Don‚Äôt dive into deep, weird topics right away.\n\n\n7. If she‚Äôs not interested, don‚Äôt keep going.\nIf she‚Äôs giving you one-word answers or avoiding you, take the hint, and stop being a pest.\n\n\n8. Be NORMAL.\nNo ‚Äúrizz‚Äù bullshit or trying to act like you‚Äôre cooler than you actually are.\n\n\n9. Give genuine compliments that are not always about looks\nCompliment her on her character or talents. Tell her, ‚ÄúYou sing really well,‚Äù or \"I admire your creativity with that project\" Avoid bullshit like ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so hot bb.‚Äù Compliments that reflect her qualities matter a lot more.\n\n\n10. Know when to wrap it up.\nIf the conversation‚Äôs dying, don‚Äôt drag it out. Just walk away like a normal person.\n\n\n11. Don‚Äôt use cringe ass WhatsApp pickup lines.\nThey never work. Just talk to her like a damn human being\n\n\n12. Don‚Äôt be afraid to be awkward.\nTrust me a lot of girls feel awkward around guys too so don‚Äôt sweat it. Just own it and keep going.\n\nThe same applies for girls",
