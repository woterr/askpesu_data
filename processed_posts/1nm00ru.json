  "content": "I have officially given up on placements and I want a rich woman to adopt me. Age doesn’t matter.\n\nI’m 6 feet tall, muscular, and 21 years old, basically at peak testosterone level and in the prime of my evolutionary male design.\n\nI will cook you Maggi with all the masalas in the world. I will scrub your floors so clean you’ll see your reflection. I will clean toilets and dust windows while humming 2000s Bollywood love songs. I will watch your favorite Korean dramas and reality TV with you and pretend to be interested. I will rub your stomach when you’re on your period bringing you chocolates and warm drinks. I will massage your feet every night and sing sweet melodies as you fall asleep\n\nYou can introduce me to your friends as “my boy toy from IIT Bangalore,” and I’ll smile politely while pouring them wine I can’t pronounce.\n\nPlease, to the sugar mommies reading this, my DMs are open. Adopt me before I end up working night shifts at TCS.",
