  "content": "I really wanna know if pes is good for bsc psychology. Ik that there are other better colleges to do psychology but most of the good ones only offer ba psychology and I wanna do bsc. I also  know that pes is good for engineering but I have no idea how good it is for other bsc courses.\n\nInitially I did wanna apply to christ but after doing some research (reading endless reddit posts) I came to the conclusion that I wouldn't want to go to such an institute that's so rigid and don't gaf about individuality.\n\nHonestly speaking pes is the only good option for me atp. I really need your advice.",
