  "content": "So my guide basically wants us to publish 2 papers, one survey paper regarding what we did in Phase 1 and another final paper. I am a total noob and I don't clearly understand how publications work. I am afraid that if we publish some stuff now, it will lead to self plagarism or some such problems later down the lane.   \nSo please suggest some resources to understand how publications work, and any resources on how to start writing a paper. Thanks a lot.",

      "body": "Don't publish twice. Instead, publish one single paper later. What you mention is right - publishing initial survey results first will just lead to a loss in novelty in the second paper. Having a single, robust and detailed paper is worth more than having 2 diluted ones. Self-plagiarism is a valid problem many run into while splitting their work into two papers."
