      "body": "Firstly, your CGPA isn't really bad. I've seen kids get shortlisted with a low-8 as well. But you're going to have to be more than your CGPA - polish your DSA concepts, revise CS theory, work on your resume etc. Since your GPA is on the lower end, you will need to complement it however you can. \n\nYou will be allowed to write the OA for most if not all companies. The only time you'll face difficulties is shortlisting for interviews. Since each company shortlists independently on different criteria, it's really difficult to predict when you might get shortlisted. It's possible the first few companies aren't rigid about CGPA requirements, while it's also possible that the first few companies are extremely strict about it. Or it could also be a random distribution. \n\nRegardless, it's not something you can do much about anyway. My suggestion would be to prepare well for placements such that your problem solving skills and CS theory concepts aren't the reason for not getting shortlisted. Aim for perfecting your abilities and ensure that you give your best during the OA, aiming for as high a score as possible. That will only leave CGPA as the bottleneck. Also - focus a bit on special topics and other components this semester, make sure to get an S grade. If unluckily you *do* not happen to get any opportunities this semester, then you should ensure that when you continue to apply in 8th semester you do have a better CGPA."
