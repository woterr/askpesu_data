I can't answer for the other colleges questions, but it's the same logic - why restrict yourself and let college make the choice for you?"

Colleges like Amrita and SRM have better rankings than PES. \n\nHowever, I think the decision of college will depend on your future goals. If your goal is to get a placement, then PES has the best placement stats for CS in the city after RVCE. If your goal is to go abroad for MS, then you should probably pick MSRIT - not because it's better ranked (rankings are irrelevant abroad if you aren't from an IIT), but simply because it's a much less stressful environment and easier to score a better CGPA."

Most people I've talked to recognise the name whereas PES certainly lacks in the recognition department overall as most people wont know about the college outside of Bangalore. In terms of placements it isn't too far imo since the college submitted data to NIRF shows a difference of about 1L in average so I won't stress much about it. MSRIT also has a better campus and social life and is comparable in fees too iirc (not sure about the fees tho)."

There are a lot of companies that recruit aiml graduates.plus there is no rule that aiml students can't sit in placements for a particular company.when any other branch students can sit in cse placement with proper skills.why would placements be bad for cse+aiml students?I'm not a graduate but i have a lot of cousins who come from engineering background (cse mostly).my older sister itself is a cse+spec graduate and she landed a job at a reputed company. I don't wanna mislead you this is just my opinion! I believe aiml is a pretty good choice. But one thing is true that aiml sure does reduce the amount of electives u can pick. I choose aiml by choice! Math is hard but aiml has super interesting applications. Sorry for the long message I'm just sick and tired of people telling bad things about the branch ðŸ˜ž."

Plus there are lots of resources for you to learn from outside as well and get certified, certificates sometimes cost money though. No one knows what'll happen with aiml.Cse is tried and trusted but aiml is called the new future.as far as I know taking cse+aiml should not affect masters or placement offers as much. Again there's no placement statistics that would suggest that aiml is bad or good. I developed a keen interest in  aiml, big data etc during 12th grade. Don't be confused you'll succeed no matter what you do. I'm sorry if the reply is all over the place! DM me if you want to discuss more about this! (FYI I'm not a graduate I'm a fresher but my sister is a graduate and has a lot of connections so i usually rely on her for advice and then research on my own)"
