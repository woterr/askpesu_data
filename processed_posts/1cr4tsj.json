Then tell them that now you are willing to pay and tell them your grades that how good are those and how financial u get benefitted etc..\n\nNow get this letter signed by the VC and head to the account section present in MRD BLOCK submit the letter thing with your fee receipt, Bank details like Ac number and IFSC(Union Bank is compulsory)give it to lady with glasses who sits there all the time \n\nThat's it she will make sure that you will get money by upcoming semesters"
