      "body": "I have the exact 2 options , the reasons I choose PESIT were\n\n1. The Degree is of Btech In Computer Science here which is not the same case with IT , it is still considered a sub branch of CSE\n2. The peer group here will be a little bit better I suppose because uk KCET and JEE High rankers along with the smart kids from PESSAT would take admission here\n3. Bangalore ( IT HUB )\n4. The fees also was a criteria here if you are in top 20% it reduces significantly due to scholarships and what not , but in MIT the fees is a little high ( this is subjective depending on how much u willing to spend )\n5. PESIT has a slight edge when it comes to overall placement , but even if you are in top kids at MIT then there also placement is good\n\nNow I also considered some disadvantages but weighed them according to my priority\n\n1. The 15% management quota\n2. The number of students , there are about 1600 kids in CSE + AIML this year both campuses\n3.  The college life may seem a little monotonous and overall development is something that will be better in MIT because of the freedom given ( could become a bad thing too )\n\n\\~ Fellow 2026 batchmate"
