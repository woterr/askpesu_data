I want to take admission in PES EC campus in EC with my rank of 2.1k, but I'm scared about the fact that this verdict from HC will hamper my admission (as a fresher in KCET). Pray that things go well and they do so quickly. Really anxious about my future. What do you think is the right solution to this problem keeping in mind the situation of both repeaters and freshers?"

In counselling they said its 22 aug but I think as there's no update regarding that, it might get postponed? Pls anyone clarify this and if possible can anyone talk to the administration office regarding this."
