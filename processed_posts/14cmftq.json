Ig boys hostel is lil better due to its location. But many had issues with the WiFi."

Hostel has all amenities like laundry , mess , gym , library etc which you wouldn't find all together in other pgs . I would suggest atleast for the first one or two years stay in hostel and then look for other options if you aren't satisfied."
