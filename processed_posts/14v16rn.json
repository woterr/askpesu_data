  "content": "Hello, I got allotted in CE in the RR campus. I was wondering if I can take a small cooler (about 25k, 1 ton) from my home to my hostel or if it'll be a problem due to moving, etc. I can't survive without AC in the summer so I'm not sure what i'll do. Can I pay a bit extra to warden to cover the bill and to let me bring the cooler? Thanks in advance. ",
