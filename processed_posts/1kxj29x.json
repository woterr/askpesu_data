      "body": "Almost everyone pursuing ECE at PES are those who want IT jobs, not core. There is no way to say with certainty exactly how many or x% are obtaining IT jobs, but most here join with that motive. The number pursuing ECE for core ECE jobs are very few. \n\nIf you intend to get into an IT job, I would recommend joining CS where you can get instead of ECE. Although people join with the intention of getting into IT (and they end up too), it is a far tougher struggle compared to being from a CS branch. There are more details about this in the FAQs: [https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/14c1iym/faqs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/14c1iym/faqs/)"
