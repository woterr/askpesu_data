Finalizing the problem statement and everything can be done in during sem 6. \n\nFor our batch (2025) we were asked to submit our team along with guide details suddenly before 6th sem was about to start. And this was after the chairperson told us not to bother and approach professors during sem 5.  Even right now for our batch they changed rules for special topic overnight and are forcing interning students to leave internships and come take up courses lol. Basically, CSE dept is not very good at conveying rules and will go back on the rules they themselves made mindlessly. Better be prepared.   \n  \nJust find yourself good teammates and possibly explore a few avenues of your interest, don't stress over it too much. then if possible, approach a few good professors with or for ideas."
