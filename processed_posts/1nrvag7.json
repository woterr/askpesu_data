  "content": "Hey everyone! Need some advice from seniors or anyone who's been in a similar situation.\n\nI'm currently in my 7th sem and interviewing with a pretty big startup off-campus. They've made me a tentative offer but want me to start full-time from January 2026 (which would be during my final semester).\n\nHas anyone dealt with something like this before? Is the college okay with students taking full-time positions during 8th sem instead of doing the traditional internship? Will PES accept the full-time role in place of internship for the required credits?\n\nWould really appreciate any insights on this.",

As you yourself are downgrading it to internship, the startup should not have any problem. Just explain them the situation, and try to convince them of the arrangement."
