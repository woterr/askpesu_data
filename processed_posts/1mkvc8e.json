  "content": "I gave the flipkart and intuit coding exam and found out that my ass couldn't even solve a single question. Leave the solving part my autistic brain couldn't even understand what's the actual question is .I am solving leetcode (beginner level) but I found that the questions in coding rounds is far complicated than the leetcode.\nSo if I want to crack atleast the coding what should I do how do I train myself to do it.",
