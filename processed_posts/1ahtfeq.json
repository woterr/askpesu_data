For example, if you have an 85/100 and get an A grade and apply for reval only to end up with 88/100, then your grade will not improve since it's still lower than the minimum marks for an S grade which is 90. \n\nAlso, if your grade does not improve you won't receive any refund from the re-evaluation."

I have heard from very few friends of mine who's grades have increased including mine.\n\nMany people had put Machine Intelligence for revaluation due to how disappointing the grades were for many with many getting C and D.\n\nAlso people with no change in grade gets no refund. For people who grades have change it shows in this form: \n\nGrade: C to B -> for individual's grade which changed from C to B.\n\nFor no change:\n\nGrade: No change"
