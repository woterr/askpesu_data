What you can do is focus on your other subjects to make up for it.\n\nIf you find yourself blanking out in an exam again, don‚Äôt panic. Skip the question, find the easiest one, and start there. Eventually, you‚Äôll get into a flow. The key is to keep moving instead of freezing.\n\nI usually don‚Äôt study an hour or so before an exam, which helps me manage my anxiety. Instead, I chill, listen to music, or watch something on YouTube. A clear mind is always better than an overloaded one."

This happened to me a lot in my first semester, which probably explains why my Semester 1 sgpa the lowest I‚Äôve ever had. Somehow, as I got more familiar with the exam patterns here and shifted my focus away from an obsessive concern with grades, I started to do so much better."

It'll matter if you want to go for masters tho but you have 8 semesters. Sem 5 and 6 are usually the scoring sems actually since the subjects get easier and you can choose the electives you want. I have frnds with <6 cgpa who have 10+ lpa jobs and people with 8+ cgpa who didn't get a single offer. Everyone stresses about cgpa in the first year but as long as you consistently study, you'll be fine. Cgpa isn't everything. And get proper sleep before the exams lol or so many days of studying will get wasted because you can't function properly. Been there."
