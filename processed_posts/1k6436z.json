  "content": "I searched through so many websites but still remain clueless, I do not have to start my internship till next year but wanted to do something during vacations. My question is how do you even approach these huge corporates for an internship? how do you apply to the big 4? I didn't receive any proper guidance via teachers and was told college doesn't help you for corporate internship in 6th semester? If anyone can help me with guidance or even tips it would help a lot!!!   ",
