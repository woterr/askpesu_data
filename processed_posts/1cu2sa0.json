  "content": "I need to talk about this to know if any of this makes sense.  \n1. People cannot participate in **cultural/fest competitions** through clubs(EC) if their GPA is below 7\n\nI know amazing dancers and singers who have not been able to go out and showcase their talent in extra-curricular if they're not up to the mark in academics\n\n2. Student council is not elected by students? (genuine question since idk how the student body is chosen)\n\nAdd onto more things that don't make sense in PES..",

No, did management do anything about it? No. Can you do something about it, possibly, but it will waste a lot of yours time, so just keep your head down and count your days backwards until you leave that hell."

Why should academics have anything to do with cultural events lol. If they want better results, let them get better professors and give us easier exams like every vtu college has lmao.
