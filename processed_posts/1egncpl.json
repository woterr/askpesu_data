PES does have a good reputation in a lot of areas and has had it for years, but it is still way behind than many other top colleges, like IIITH, IIITB, LNMIT, NIT Tirchy, NIT Warangal, etc.  Look, if they take JEE Mains, the cream are'nt necessarily gonna choose PES for sure, which is something they would want, as their options increase. Also, idts you understand how many people join this place. This place has a huge population of thousands, and they need so many students for the money, now you can't really admit a lot of people through either JEE and KCET. So if this is their plan to increase management quota admissions then it's a vicious plan."

I agree that the campus is nowhere close, but if they work at such companies, faculty and alumni network is amazingly strong.\n\nSince they want the cream, they are doing this. In a span of 50 years, if they are able to garner such a network, the aspiration alone would be enough to get them to the top. Youâ€™re unnecessarily pessimistic about the kids joining there.\n\nEven on day-to-day activities for coding, they are a mile ahead based on my experience. I had not interviewed them, but the amount of skill and knowledge PESU kids have is amazing. \n\nWe had been stuck on a problem, mind you we have engineers from top NITs, and yet they couldnâ€™t crack it. The new joiner from PES was able to provide a solution in less than a week. \n\nTake your unnecessary shit posting somewhere else kid!"

On some days, the paper was tough whereas on the other days, the paper was on the easier side. They don't release the questions or answer keys or marks cards. So there's always been speculation that the normalisation of marks done in PESSAT might not be accurate, leading to a difference in the expected and real ranks."

It is down to the sheer stupidity of the redditor. He/she is making tall claims without backing information.\n\nThey are just shitting on a college that could potentially be someoneâ€™s 4 year university. I definitely cannot withstand such low IQ comments. They are probably a bunch of salty people because they werenâ€™t able to crack another college and get beaten up for it at their home. \n\nIt hurts them when someone is spitting out facts. Also what would you do in a 100 acre campus anyways? In your complete lifetime at the college, you would hardly cover 5 acres. And thatâ€™s from experience. Kids these days are more about showing off than the numbers. I just got to know that in 34 years, the alumni have founded ~70 startups. Something that this private university is doing right!"
