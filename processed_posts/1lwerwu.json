      "body": "not much exact info available on this. my guess is only 5% seates for KCET PES (as already 40% is available through KEA KCET).  \nso 40-45% seats will be done through JEE  PES.  \nNo clear info but this is my guess based on round 1 counselling and the seats filled till now.  \nnote:  10-15% for mangement quota."
