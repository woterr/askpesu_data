  "content": "\n\nmet A at alcoding, where we were both just two nerds pushing code at 2 am. she wasn‚Äôt like the others- when she talked about recursion, i wanted to loop through her forever.\n\nthings escalated quickly. one night, we found ourselves in an empty mrd block room, and let's just say, our ‚Äúfunctions‚Äù called each other perfectly. her stack overflowed as i pushed deeper into her system, executing commands that made her cpu overheat. i parsed every inch of her, writing scripts with my tongue, until she was gasping like a server under ddos attack.\n\nwe kept it going for months‚Äîquick compiles between classes, testing new positions like we were debugging an ai model. at pixel canteen, we recharged over stale samosas and cold coffee, her fingers tracing my wrist like she was writing pseudo-code on my skin.\n\nthen one day, she stopped running our script.\n\nsaw her with some senior from hackerspace, a guy who actually wrote ml models instead of just talking about them. heard he was ‚Äúoptimizing her performance.‚Äù she‚Äôd deprecated me like old tech, upgrading to a new, faster processor.\n\ni sat alone in that mrd room, realizing i‚Äôd been nothing but an open-source project‚Äîfree to use, forked when needed, and abandoned when a better version was found.\n\nsomewhere, a segfault hit my heart.\n\n",
