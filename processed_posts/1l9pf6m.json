Im a vegetarian tho but they I know they give non veg around 3 times a week.\n\nGym - Campus gym is available till 7:15pm and its very close to hostel\n\nLaundry services are inside hostel , there's a good study room , small table tennis,foozball , carrom and chess area and a vending machine. That's pretty much it. Rooms are good , especially the ones with the attached bathroom and wifi works fine. \n\n  \nThe only cons are that it's hard to get hostel right now because of the demand"
