Also, its not worth joining via JEE since there is basically no advantage - the fees is the same as PESSAT. Why work your ass off to get 98 percentile in JEE Mains and pay the same as someone who got in through CET-level PESSAT lmao.\n\nHere is the link to the fees: [https://pes.edu/fee-details/](https://pes.edu/fee-details/)"
