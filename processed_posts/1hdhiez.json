  "content": "A guy in my class ( im in first year) is from a village in karnataka. He is real brainy. Spoke to him and got to know a few things - 1. he is in pes because this is the best college kcet was giving him via rural quota, 2. His father works in railways - for him coming to this college is fun because \"he gets to ride in the train from his village to bangalore junction for free\" , he lives in the hostel and says - the food here is not very nice because his mother cooks better, but the beds are soft and it has good electricity supply\". His goal is literally to earn enough every month after 4 years so that he can take his family to a 5 star cuisine every weekend. \n\nLife changes when you hear the views of everyone ! For us something out of our comfort zone and substandard might be someones luxury! Our basic \"enjoyment\" would be someones dreams! \n\nAlso to the retarded motherduckers - stop teasing folks from different backgrounds and quotas - cause bitch you aint anything better ! Learn to show respect and value someones opinion and not laugh on everything like a brain-rot drunkard. \n\nthis is through a anonymous throughaway account, you will not find me again here on r/PESU from this account or messaging anything further.",

Of course you shouldn't discriminate anyone based on their ethnicity but then, what if another equally bright guy from his village, in general quota, missed out on PES because he didn‚Äôt have reservation?

I lie somewhere in between both of them, but I feel grateful for everything that I have and I feel so guilty that I am not trying hard enough when I look at them studying so hard to make their parents happy :\\_ ) ."
