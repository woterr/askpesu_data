Yes, about 3-4 companies have visited and come have gotten PPOs from their summer internship as well. \nPlacements start in the last week of July in your final year, and go on all the way till June end. So if you graduate in 2022, your placements begin in July 2021 and end in June 2022. For the 2023 batch, their placements started 2 weeks ago and will end only in June 2023."
