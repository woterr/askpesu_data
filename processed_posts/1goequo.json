  "content": "Possibly a good event ruined by shitty management.. spent more time standing in line (4+ hours)than the actual event and once entered all they did was soundcheck and dragging anchoring.. concert had the almost a dead beat audience for the most part initially cause everyone had almost lost interest due to delay.. most including me left cause we travelled from so far (EC) .. Concert felt like a single along than a fun show.. honestly 50Rs event felt more entertaining than this (EC campus)..",

Experienced the same thing, and worst part is management were clueless for most of the part of the event. \nAnd inspite being 7 they kept on showing the last yearâ€™s Kannada koota videos, Its like bro we know last year was awesome, this yearâ€™s achievements were just making edits if last yearâ€™s program."
