Culturally, RR has and will always be richer. You're going to find a much larger variety of clubs, grander and larger fests and more events. EC on the other hand has always been known to have smaller fests and fewer events. This is a well known fact. \n\n> ALL COOL CLUBS ARE THERE AND THEYRE ALL ACTIVE.\n\nBut the quality of clubs (primarily, tech clubs) at ECC are leagues ahead of what exists in RR. When it comes to clubs, where ECC lacks in quantity, it more than enough makes up in quality. You're not going to find a 100 different clubs that hold 1 event throughout a year. Instead you'll find maybe 20 that instead actively meet multiple times a semester. Right now, there's a world of difference, especially if you're someone looking for tech communities."

No point in coming up with reductionist idelogies to guilt 1st years into pressured study. Act like this then complain why ec campus has more suicidesðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡ clg is the only time where people can be a little free and lowkey live. Scratch your itch somewhere else. Delusional my ass"

      "body": "If you don't believe me, consider the comments from other current students in different years who support my statement about ECC tech clubs being miles ahead. The placements stat is absolutely not true, more students get in from RR, but that is not because interviewers select people from RR (it's been discussed in the FAQs, it's simply down to more people from RR applying for a single company). As for the hype surrounding the shift to RR, many still choose ECC not because of subjective factors that suit them better, but rather because they were unable to get into RR. So they are bound to feel that way. It does not help that people's idea of \"cultural events in colleges\" matches RR's energy rather than EC."
