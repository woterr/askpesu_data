  "content": "I received a rank of 28K in KCET 2024 and a rank of 6K in PESSAT 2024, and I have some doubts on which college and branch I should join.\n\nIn the first round counselling of PESSAT, the cutoff for ECE was 3.9K rank and EEE was 6.5K. I could get ECE in BNMIT and RNSIT in the last round of KCET counselling, but I am not sure what to do. I can get PESU ME through KCET last round counselling as well. But i preferably want ECE. I plan to do Masters as well(idk if its in india or abroad).\n\nSo it would be helpful if you all give some advice.",
