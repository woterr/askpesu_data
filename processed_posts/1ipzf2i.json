  "content": "How come every time I feel like thereâ€™s always an exam ahead? Itâ€™s like I just live to write exams. Always, always, thereâ€™s an exam in front of me. Previously, I used to study by this time (I mean, a week before), but now Iâ€™m not even interested in studying. I used to be so focused by this time, but surprisingly, I somehow joined a kabaddi team. Itâ€™s like, *jo hoga dekha jayega*. So, how do I come out of this situation?\"",
