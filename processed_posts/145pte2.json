  "content": "I noticed that the portal which allows us to confirm our attendance for the counselling mentions the first round initially and on clicking 'continue' takes us to another page asking us to confirm our attendance for the second round counselling. Why is that so? Without attending the first round counselling I don't think I'll be able to decide whether I need to attend the second round counselling session(Screenshots have been attached of the same for reference). Can anyone help me with this?",
