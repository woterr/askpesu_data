      "body": "You have to pay 10k on pesuacademy. Just go to online payments in pesuacad and there under category of recreational center you’ll find gym fee for 25-26. Then you have tk wait for 2-3 days for rhe receipt to come. Download it and go to gjbc basement near basketball court, there you’ll can ask anyone where the gym office is and show them receipt. They’ll make your card there and get your face scanned."
