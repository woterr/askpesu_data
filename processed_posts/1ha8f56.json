I experienced something very weird like as u go deep into the opp side of the pes university (opp side of sutta gully) at night u won't get network properly despite being <1km far from the college and even gps doesn't work there and that area is creepy as fuck with no proper roads and hardly any people outside \n\nFor friend 1: A gay guy came and asked him whether he could suck his dick.He was followed for a long time before he reached pg and locked himself\n\nFriend 2: His mobile was stolen while he was walking on the road by some auto ppl,they dragged him along for a distance cause he didn't leave his phone from his hand\n\nAnd many more.."
