      "body": "A lot of jargon is being thrown around here but basically, PES is accredited as a University by UGC, which means that it has to follow whatever policies are being enforced by UGC. The key word here being \"enforced\", which means that UGC may choose to have guidelines and suggestions but PES is free to do as they choose (which is what happened during COVID) as long as it isn't a strict mandate. \n\n\"Deemed to be uni\" essentially means to be granted autonomy over it's functions. Which is what PES has. It became one in 2014. What you and the other commenter are referring to are the same."

The moment you add more credits, the tuition fee is guaranteed to increase. And it's PES, they will definitely bump up the fees by a bit.\n\nOf course you'll save money if you don't stay in hostel, but I don't think that's the main outcome here."
