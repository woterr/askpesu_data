But how long do I keep wishing for someone while never getting the chance to have someone by my side in this absolute rat race? It would be so nice to have a partner to support each other through this student phase and hopefully build a long-term relationship.",

Always be yourself cause if you pretend to be someone you won't enjoy talking to the person cause you will always have to pretend and it will get irritating after a time(if you say weird ass or outrageous things I've met a few girls who find that fun). Try to become their friend first but keep dropping very subtle hints that you are interested(keep it very subtle or it will get creepy) so you don't get friendzoned. And please for the love of God don't just stick to talking about studies and job and shit ; Diversify your knowledge know a little bit about most things so you could hold a conversation. Try having fun rather than impressing that will happen naturally if you guys have fun.\n\nTip: if you're texting someone never close the conversation. Always leave it open ended so they have to respond to you and that way you can keep the conversation going. Keep in check whether the person is talking to you or just responding to you."
