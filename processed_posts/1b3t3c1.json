Initially it will be a difficult adjustment ( It was for me atleast) but eventually you will get there. I can only speak for 1st year subjects and they are pretty good, not that hard if you pay attention in classes and are consistent with your studies. \n\nFor PESSAT, you will be able to do well if you have already prepared well for JEE. In my opinion no preperation is required if you already know and can solve things covered in JEE.\n\nRegardless of what college you decide to join you will have to face new challenges you haven't faces before so be resilient and be mentally prepared for anything. Try not to get distracted and stay focused on your goals. Prioritise and plan for your future. \nAll the best!"

And yes, if you're financially well off (read too rich) then take admission through pessat. Middle class means don't consider pessat or jee. Kcet should do. Else PESSAT fees is not worth it even for CSE. 24 lakhs total fees. Plus hostel if needed. That is almost as costly as IIM Bangalore. Trust me it is good for CSE placement wise. Social life and all, I wasn't lucky to have one. My fault too.\nI recommend speaking to the students about the academics. It's way too rigorous as compared to other colleges."

For good local experience it's better to learn respective state language either kannada, tamil, telugu, malyalam. Have a open mind to learn and adjust .I mean why so resistance to learn a language man? and Yes, people of South are really different so you cant expect everyone to know hindi."
