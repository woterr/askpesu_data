  "content": "Hey , I have to buy a laptop this year  and am thinking of going for mac air m4, since it has all features I need , I heard some people say that many of our 2nd year softwares don't run on / hard to work on mac. So any senior who have had mac, how did u work with it? Will i face any problems in 3rd or 4th year as well??\n Please answer, will be highly appreciated üëè üò©üôè\n[PS - I desperately want an mac and have been saving up for it, so please don't convince me against itüò≠üò≠]",

But again the average windows user is fucking retarded, so your good to go. Plus mac is basically unix, which is a plus. \n\nAs far as linux on mac is concerned - you can use UTM or install asahi linux.\n\n  \nid suggest go for the 512gb variant, helps a lot."
