I still feel a lingering burn on me whenever I think of it\nThe second time I was ragged it was much more severe. They pressured one of my class mates to tell me that a girl wants to confess to me. I was told to go to a corner where there weren't many people. I was beaten up and dirty water they had taken from the bathroom was thrown on me. I had to lie to the doctor that the bruises were just from me falling down\nI go to college in constant fear and constantly look around scanning for them. At break times I hid in the bathrooms to not get bullied. The staff won't do anything about it since they don't have any proof and everyone signed an \"anti-ragging\" Form.j"
