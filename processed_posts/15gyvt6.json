Set up a free VPN server on oracle cloud, and browse whatever you wanna browse. \nThere’s plenty of tutorials on how to do it.\n\nAdditionally there are also several credentials on the PESU network that have unrestricted access to content, some have been shared by students on this subreddit before, can’t vouch for their availability right now though."
