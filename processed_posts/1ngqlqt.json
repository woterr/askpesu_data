I remember for Commvault test last year there was strict attendance taken and the link was only sent to those present in the assessment centre and also there were many ppl from the company like 15-20 people to invigilate in every room. I can guarantee that it would have been impossible to cheat in that OA. If the company is willing to invest resources to stop cheating they can, but most companies want the invigilation to be done by the college which is going to be strictly enforced."
