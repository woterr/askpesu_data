      "body": "1. Online degrees do not carry the same weight as equivalent offline ones (at least, not yet) since the entry bar is much lower. It is not the same as actually pursuing the degree offline from BITS. You will still be considered a graduate of PES with an online degree from BITS. Not a graduate of BITS. \n2. You will sit for placements from PES, which means you will be recognised as a PESt. When it comes to off-campus, do you plan to hide your PES degree? If yes then you have only an online UG degree which companies do not prefer and is not treated seriously. If not, then don't think that having 2 CS degrees is going to raise eyebrows about your decision?"

I believe pesu has a very hectic curriculum which can he hard on manage time on both courses \n\n  \nI am looking into these courses, but I'll be waiting till the last date to decide, but if I do end up taking it would mostly be iit m"

These courses can at best help you cover missing courses that might be needed to clear admission requirements. At worst, they aren't going to add anything.\n\nIf your goal is a Masters, then it is your CGPA, SOP and other essays, LORs and overall profile comprising your skills, experiences, projects etc that will matter. Completing a course from BITS/IIT etc will not add anything here, except to help you meet requirements as I mentioned. If you are in ECE or other non-CS branches and do not take up a CS Minors at PES, then it is reasonable to take it up. However, if you are already from CS, and are applying to CS programs, then you already have those requirements met and the course will add zero value."
