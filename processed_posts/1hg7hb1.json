  "content": "I was in the ec campus canteen in 4th floor yesterday morning and saw a really really pretty girl. She was in front of me standing for coffee or tea and I 100% sure saw her seeing reddit on her phone at that time. Then she went and sat alone in a table. I figured she's in  2nd year or 3rd year because her laptop was open with slides for some exam. She was wearing a black jaclet, a bit tall, fit, quite long hair, medium tone skin. I became dysnfunctional. She looked at me for a few moments and didnt smile, just stared. I was shy too talk to her and didnt want to bother because ik guys like me don't have a chance. so  created a throwaway account just to say it. Ma'am if your reading this, I'm down bad. ",
