      "body": "I've posted a similar comment before just yesterday regarding NIT vs PES. The same logic applies here. If you want to pursue CS and are planning a Master's also in CS, then you'll doom yourself by picking Civil here - your IIT tag won't offer any saving grace when you don't meet the college's basic course requirements. Also as someone pointed out, branching from Civil to CS is extremely difficult and unlikely. Maybe try looking for an IIT or NIT which you can get something like ECE or IT (idk if this exists) so it'll still keep the door half open for a Masters. If you don't plan on pursuing Masters at all, then go for IIT. In all likelihood you'll get placed at an IT company and that tag will bring you the big money. But you'll probably not be able to pursue anything close to CS after that."
