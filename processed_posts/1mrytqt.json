  "content": "**On August 2nd, our world turned upside down.**\n\nWe received devastating news: my 6-year-old sister, **Netra Jhalani**, has been diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of liver cancer — **Metastatic Fibrolamellar Hepatocellular Carcinoma**. She is currently being treated at **Max Hospital, Saket (New Delhi).**\n\nNetra is the heart and soul of our family. Her laughter lights up our home, and her joyful spirit brings smiles to everyone she meets. But now, she’s facing a fight that no child should ever have to endure.\n\nThe diagnosis has shattered us. My mother broke down in tears, and the rest of us have been trying to stay strong for Netra. No words can prepare a family to hear *cancer* — especially when it’s about a child so young and full of life.\n\nThe doctors have laid out a critical and aggressive treatment plan:\n\n* **Transarterial Radioembolization**\n* **Major liver surgery**\n* **Intensive chemotherapy**\n\nThe estimated cost of treatment is **₹25 lakhs** — an overwhelming figure for our family.\n\nWe’ve done everything we possibly can: sold our jewelry, drained our savings, and sought help from loved ones. So far, we’ve managed to raise **₹18 lakhs**, but we’re still short by **₹6–7 lakhs** — and we need your support to continue Netra’s treatment without delay.\n\nWe are humbly reaching out for help. Whether it's through a donation, sharing this message, or keeping Netra in your prayers — **every bit counts**.\n\nPlease help us give Netra the chance she deserves — to grow up, to celebrate birthdays, to chase her dreams, and simply, to live.\n\n**With sincere gratitude,**",
