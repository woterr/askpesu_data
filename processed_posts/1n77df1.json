      "body": "Most of this has been answered before, but since I am jobless, let me elaborate:\n\nI would say it's pretty unfair to make this comparison because >80% of PES' identity (regardless of campus) is built on its placements. I have said the same about both campuses previously: take placement stats away, and the mediocrity shines through. There honestly isn't much to PES without the placements, so if you take that away, what exactly are the comparing factors?\n\nInfrastructure at ECC is okay. Definitely not close to RR (which itself has been going through extensive renovation since 2018). I wouldn't say its far behind BMSCE and the other colleges you mentioned, it just looks pretty subpar when put next to RR because a lot of money has been invested into RR recently. Cannot comment about hostels; I'll let someone else answer this.\n\nCrowd is similar to RR. Academically, the difference in average GPA isn't statistically significant (usually <0.5 every sem). However, in recent years, ECC has had a much stronger tech community, and presence, with the best and most active tech communities flourishing there. The tech scene at RR is a proper comedy compared to ECC. But, RR does offer a wider range in clubs and opportunities to explore other interests. So if you are really passionate about tech, then ECC clubs are much better. But if you value variety, RR is better. Fests just like RR are okay. Nothing groundbreaking, regardless of campus. They are nice moments to have fun and make memories with friends, but nothing to boast about. \n\nThe peer group is pretty good, similar to RR. Overall, PES has a great peer group and alumni network from both campuses, and the crowd has always known to be competitive and successful. If you find a good group, it will encourage you to do better and work harder.\n\nTo summarize, its fine. The main edge is placements, take that away and there is no a big deal about PES, and that applies to both campuses."

      "body": "I'll take over this, I have a festing career of 4 years (I'm thankfully not a bring up of Narayana, Chaitanya, Deeksha etc) and fortunately from a college that hosts arguably better fests than PESU (both campuses lol)\n\n1. A fest isn't about the budget, it's about the break from academics. That's where the real *vibe* is, in the shared laughter, chaos, crazy-ness?, and the whole community coming alive together.\n\n2.The fun comes from those \"dopamine hits\"-live music, dancing like idiots, anxiety of Ws and Ls before the result announcements, hogging on food stalls or just dressing up and flooding your gallery with pics. It's the creativity, not the cash, that makes it fun.\n\n3. Big-name artists don't automatically make a fest better. Half the time the hype takes over the reality and people walk away disappointed. (This is a very underrated point, you'll only realise this if you have had such experiences before)\n\n4.Fests aren't restricted to one campus. You can pull up to Maaya and Atmatrisha, and you get holidays for both of it.\n\n5.The real gold is in the organizing. From managing events and handling security to pulling sponsors, setting up tech, designing, editing, and coding sites and bro the people in RR won't let you take it, I know so many talented seniors crushed by the amount of competition + bias there so EC significantly wins here trust me."

If they even gave us half the budget of AT the we could deliver an event that students look up to every year."
