The total no. of lab classes we can \"bunk\" is supposedly 3 and I have already missed out on 2 of em. I'm pretty sure I'll need more of a buffer than just 1 more class over the course of the semester, so what do I do? One of my friends said he heard that for labs the criteria is 65% but he's not sure, is that true? Has anybody gotten by with less than 75% in labs before?",
