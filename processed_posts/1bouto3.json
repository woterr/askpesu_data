      "body": "I'm not a girls hostel student and hence I cannot answer all the questions. However, my girlfriend is in Girl's hostel and the hostel curfew sucks. It's at 7PM from Monday to Saturday and 8PM on Sunday. It's hard to get permission to come late and there's quite a bit of beaurocracy to obtain the permission. You have to put attendance everyday and obtain permission from local guardian if you have to go back home ( Local guardian is a relative who lives in the city and is above the age of 35).\n\n  \n\n\nThe food is not great either. I have heard many girls complaining about the food. There are 4 hostel Units, with the closest one being 1.4km from the college. Buses are provided to and from the college.\n\n  \n\n\nI would suggest living in a PG close to college, there are quite many PGs near the college."
