      "body": "A) The Professors are average at best. Most good professor left during peak covid time. The ECE dept in general in RR campus is disoriented\n\nB) The Labs and Facilities are average if you wanna do ECE properly. They just have enough equipments and facilities to conduct small experiments for your coursework . Even to use what is left of those in the labs, you have to go through a tedious process to gain access to use the labs unless you are in very good terms with professor who work in the labs which is just a waste of time. ( They just gaslight and catfish you into projects which can be made by even beginners who grasp a decent amount of Hardware , microcontroller and electronics knowledge and they just showcase that.\n\nC) Placements of ECE are not good . While this is true in Most engineering colleges , pes is no exception to that . This season only 30% got placed in ECE dept with highest as 24.62 and median 8.5 ( Only 20-22 out of 551 ECE students got T1 placements ). Yes this time market was bad and placements was bad in general . The year before recession there was 64 T1 offers , 170  T2  and 39 T3 offers out of 400 ECE students eligible for placements .\n\nD) The campus life aint that good , its a pretty small campus with lot of students coming so its pretty crowded but apart from that its decent"

There are drug scenes in manipal but people fail to see the part where they win IRDC , IRC (International Rover Competiton ) , ERC, IMH beating even IITs , BITS , NITS in those competition , they make mars rovers , research in robotics , ece , hardware is much better over there .\n\nAgain choice is in your hands . If placements is your ultimate goal all this won't matter just take pes ECE"
