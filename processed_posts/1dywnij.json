  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm a fresher about to join ec campus and I've recently found a pretty decent PG accommodation in electronic city and I'm looking for a roommate. Here are the details:\n\n**Location:** Around 2km from campus\n\n**Size:** It's a 2bhk flat made for 4 people, around 1400 sq ft so pretty spacious and way better than hostel\n\n**Rent:** 11k per month (Includes furniture no need to rent or buy, food is provided but would cost you around 3k extra so pretty similar compared to hostel)\n\n**Facilities:** Fully furnished flat and includes all appliances, the apartment also has a clubhouse and gym\n\n**Safety:** The PG is in a secure neighborhood and has security\n\nPersonally I found the amaatra hostel pretty cramped and if you have seen it in person you know what I'm talking about. It's around a 15x10 room with 4 people living in it which is pretty tight. Rules and regulations are absurd and like 6-7km away from campus so the PG is definitely a pretty good alternative which should be considered.\n\nCurrently including me there are two other students that are already confirmed, we are just looking for a 4th roommate. Please feel free to DM me any questions that you have",
