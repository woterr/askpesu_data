A few others are also there.\n\nMost of them have some sort of entrance test based on aptitude and/or assignment, along with CGPA requirements, and most of them take in students only after 2nd year (CDSAML takes in after first year, maybe a few others do too). \n\nAlthough fair caution that the research labs here aren't really great since a lot of the good core and knowledgeable professors have left, leaving these clubs to unequipped and incapable professors."
