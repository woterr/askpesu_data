  "content": "I really wanna try out a few of the events, competitions and orientations, but cannot right now due to some reasons, so I wanted to know if the number and quality of these events will be the same throughout the whole sem and can try them a few weeks later also.   \nOr is it just that these events happen for the first few weeks and then become super rare couple more weeks into the sem?",
