They all actually liked the course work and the only time they complained was when we had 5 internals instead of the two we have now.  It is pretty competitive as there were around 800 students in CS (in my batch) so it might get hard to cope at times."

My classmates were nice as well, not the rowdy gang. Our research culture has deteriorated a lot and the current HOD isn't very approachable or supportive. When it comes to placements, if your basics are decent, u can get placed easily. Bosch, LAM, Schneider, Mercedes Research are a few big names that come for mechanical. If u r girl, then it gets a lot easier with placements. I would personally not recommend PES for mech right now."

I've joined through KCET. honestly the placements are really dogshit for Mech. Core Mech companies do come but end up recruiting CSE for IT roles or they taken in women in the name of diversity. I personally hope your give your decision of joining Mech in PES a second thought."
