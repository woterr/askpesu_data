Marks for theory and lab is calculated seperate and added with an overall weightage of 5.\nStatics for example is three credit and will affect your gpa lower than something like chemistry.\n\nJust read the FAQ for any more questions."

      "body": "Ok so basically credits are like the weightage of a given subject w.r.t your cgpa. Main course subjects are 4 credits and if there's a lab with that subject it'll be 5 credits. In sem 1, you have civil, electronics and math which are 4 credit courses and chemistry and CS which are 5 credit courses because they have a lab attached to the subject. Constitution was a 2 credit subject for us  but I think it doesn't count for credits for my juniors, but I'm not sure abt that. So without constitution, your credits for that semester will be 4*3+5*2 which is 22 credits.  If I overly simplify it, the impact of your marks of a subject like math will be 4/22 and chem will be 5/22 roughly. There's a formula with which you can calculate your sgpa given your grades but this is just like an outline of what credits are"
