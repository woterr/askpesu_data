  "content": "when registering for PESSAT it gives a different option for JEE mains students saying \" PESSAT (JEE Main candidates) \" . given I have scored 98.5 percentile in my JEE main first attempt this year, what exactly is the procedure, do they make me write PESSAT or do I get in directly. I am also aware of the heightened fee. \nPS: I know I'm better off getting in through KCET or look elsewhere, I'm just asking out of curiosity.",
