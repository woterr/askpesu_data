Maybe in some cases, the student didn't have a choice as their parents or family forced them, but that's definitely not on PES. \nThis is not the time or the place for this argument. You wanna talk about idealizing the rich, do it when someone hasn't just passed away. To his family, he's still the person they love and THAT is something we should respect."

The first time, my grandfather asked me to touch his feet, since my education (and therefore, my future) was in part due to his vision and ideas. He said that MRD's blessings were something I shouldn't miss.\n\nI've voted 4 times in my life, and coincidentally, I've met him and received his blessings every time. I've done well since, and even though I'm not a very religious or \"sanskari\" person, I am very thankful for him. Not just for myself, but also for the fact that he had a major role in the education of tens of thousands (maybe even lakhs) of students in Karnataka and beyond.\n\nMay he rest in peace."
