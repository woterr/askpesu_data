You will need to ask someone from MSRIT for an accurate review.\n\n>Please give some tricks to Crack pessat ( like which day to attend exam, comparatively which shit would be easier n all)\n\nIts KCET level, or a bit higher. Ideally, does not require additional prep. As for which shift and other hacks, there is no way to predict. Its best to focus on the exam and prepare rather than focusing on the hacks.\n\n>If you have any contacts to get me a seat in pes please please text me. I would be really happy\n\nI would not recommend joining via management quota. Its too expensive and does not justify the fees you pay. There are multiple posts on this subreddit that highlight why, just search and you will find."

They will try to bring in companies as they usually do, but the companies that actually visit and the number of students selected are completely up to the company and the job market at that time. Placement season is usually very competitive and with each company taking in a handful at most, it can get very stressful. Every year, it gets exponentially tougher and the number of unplaced students will also increase. This is true at every college, not just PES."

The number and quality of opportunities are obviously far better at IIT/NIT/BITS/NIT.  Nobidy is denying that. \n\nBut the harsh truth is, regardless of which college you're in, *you* will need to put in the effort to get placed and have skills that the industry needs. No company will just pick you up looking at your college. Look at placement stats at most top colleges this year and see the number of unplaced students - even IITs this year have unplaced students still looking for jobs. At the end of the day, if you aren't industry-ready, nobody will recruit you. It's upto you if you want to live in a bubble that a BTech automatically guarantees you a job."

Just know what you're signing up for. Don't keep unrealistic expectations of some chill college life. If you're joining PES the academics will be rigorous. Try not to get backlogs and just maintain good relations with your faculty and you're good to go. People that hate on this college have no valid reasons to do so (apart from the management, they suck lol). The faculty is full of young people that are more than eager to help you. You guys have no idea how ahead PES in terms of curriculum and labs as compared to other colleges in Bangalore. If you're coming here, just know you'll be expected to work hard academically. If that's not what you want, don't come here. As simple as that."
