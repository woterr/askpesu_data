      "body": "1)See the PYQ's there are a bunch of questions which have a higher probability of coming in the paper \n\n2) try to watch videos to understand the process and write it on your own words \n\n3) this method worked for me you can try it too. I am better at remembering diagrams and pictures so I used to draw and learn the processes from diagrams and I also used to make mindmaps to recall\n\n4) distribute your syllabus into smaller subtopics and learn one at a time, focus on understanding rather than by hearting it \n\n5)If you can relate what you learn to real life examples so you can recall it better in the exams\n\nHope this helps"
