      "body": "Gowri is one of the best profs. She's very sweet and understanding too. She is extremely knowledgeable about the courses she teaches (she also takes CV) and is the best research advisor also at PES. She's also very friendly with students and there have been multiple accounts of her helping out students in need (can personally vouch for this). A lot of students stay in touch with her because she's a really nice person as well - if you go to the ground floor in B block you'll see the pictures she's taken with her capstone students on the boards. Her LORs are also very valuable (she is a CMU alumni). She is overall one of the best profs still left at PES. \n\nPrafullata is also good. She knows the course content pretty well and specialises in it too. She might not be the best but she's much better than the average prof here at PES. Prafullata is also pretty friendly, especially if you work with her as TA or part of the CCBD lab. She's very active on the group and keeps inviting her students to come visit and there have been multiple meetups too. Unfortunately I haven't been able to make it to even one but they all looked fun from the pictures lol."

Where did the profs who left, go to? Other colleges in bangalore/india, or research/Industry?Â  And what would be the major reason - just even better opportunities outside or something else?Â  TIA."
