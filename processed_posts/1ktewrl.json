He's not very good at teaching and just wants students to memorize things. It's confusing why he's in the AI/ML department because he teaches basic subjects like Software Engineering, Cloud Computing, and Operating Systems, which many other teachers could handle. He's also the one who creates the question papers for those three subjects."
