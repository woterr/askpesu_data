  "content": "If you're feeling low about placements, just remember more companies are yet to come. Sometimes the process is so random that a rejection isnâ€™t really your fault.\n\nNot landing an on-campus job isnâ€™t the end of the road. People go for higher studies, build businesses, or find great opportunities off-campus all the time.\n\nEventually, we'll all figure it out, trust the process.",

Disappointing part is that he did orientation events in every semester but never displayed core placement stats .... We saw it only after coming to 4 th year.... He just manipulated us(Ece students)"
