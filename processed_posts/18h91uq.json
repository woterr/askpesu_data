Study hard to get good in the second isa and esa. First year isn't that hard, you have time to get a good grade. If not you can withdraw the course, but i wouldn't recommend it because it just makes your future that much harder"

      "body": "You won't be held back. You will have to take the ESAs again in the following semesters. \n\nMore importantantly if you have another ISA coming up, you can work hard to make sure you pass in the end. It's never too late."
