People will say brand value or some horseshit like that but 90% of the people in my department got a job or internship on their own(me included ) and PES didn't do anything to help with this. I would suggest PES only if you're sure you can maintain a high cgpa and get placed in a good company. Fees won't matter if you get placed in a good company. New Horizon isn't the best, but PES isn't as good as ppl say it is either"
