She asks questions every day and is very particular about lab submission and all so really pay attention in class and take good notes and don't fuck around. Outside class, sheâ€™s super sweet.\n\nVinay is also nice. Used to give us free attendance. I had him for both sems and as a mentor too, guy called me only once the whole year and never bothered me with lame questions."
