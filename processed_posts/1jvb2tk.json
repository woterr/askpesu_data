  "content": "Hi seniors,\n\nI was a silent scroller on this sub and only decided to make an account today to ask a question to the seniors. \n\nI am currently in 4th Sem, and I honestly don't have a good cgpa (its in the high 7's) and some of my friends have already secured an internship in some top companies even though they have a similar cgpa to mine. Most have gotten through referrals but some smart ones with high cgpa have secured on their own. \n\nThis is honestly taken a toll on me and made me a bit depressed, will I ever be able to maintain a good cgpa or get an internship or placement ever. And honestly, I feel I am late to many of the things, like I should have been ready with good projects by the end of first year and I should have started Leet code by now. But I have done none of that and my end semester exams are in a month.\n\nI am very clueless and don't know what to do. Coding used to be my passion back in school and 11th and 12th but now a days I am finding it very reluctant to code. Even while watching a movie or playing a game, I feel very bad that I am wasting my time not studying. Last semester even though I slogged (about 6hrs I studied every day during my esas) I managed to get a sgpa only in high 7's. \n\nHave any of you have gone through this phase and how do I make myself better? Seeing others in a relationship, them getting internships, watching their lives get better every day, etc. is slowing killing me inside, not that I hate them but the fact that I hate myself for not doing anything to make my life better. \n\nAny advice or any path or roadmap I should follow, please please please I beg you can you help me with it? \n\nPS I am not suicidal or anything, I am just lost and do not know what to do.",
