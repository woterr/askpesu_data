The number of people who are inherent geniuses and can ace after studying 1-2 days only is marginal, probably a handful. \n\nIf you put in efforts from day 1, it becomes a lot simpler. 1-2 hours per day isn't much. Try it for a week and you'll see you'll already be updated with every class and the weekends are all to yourself."
