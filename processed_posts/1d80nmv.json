Best case scenario, you aren't allowed to sit for the placement test and PES goes easy on you. Worst case scenario, you end up getting selected and then later get caught when you need to submit your documents to the company."

Apparently there is one in July but I am yet to confirm the details. When writing a backlog exam it's important to note that, the entire pass or fail is based on the paper itself, which means the internal marks you gained no longer count. Once you clear a backlog paper they will update your marks card and your gpa as well. How the updates are done is a bit unclear at this time to me. For every backlog you can attempt it 4 times to pass it."
