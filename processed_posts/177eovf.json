      "body": "You cannot get the previous year questions. ISAs have always been computer based and papers aren't released. Your best bet is to practice using questions in the notes and slides along with previous year ESA papers, found on library.pes.edu\n\nNote: With ESAs becoming hybrid too, you'll probably not be able to view previous year questions after a point"

      "body": "Hey u can check out the pesu opac website, u will find previous year papers over there. Login (you will have the password in pesuacademy), go to the search menu , type your subject name and filter under digital library. There may be some old isa papers over there, but mostly all are esa papers. So check those out, you have papers from the past 15 years."
