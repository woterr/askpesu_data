  "content": "Like the title says, I wanted to know more about life in PESU, what it is like being a PESU student, like the college life, cultural activities, lectures, management, clubs (selection process), etc and also if the cultural events held are managed by the students clubs or the college staff\n\nI know you need to forget what life is when you're a PESU Student, how do I know that? Well I read the past 15 days post and comments, also the fact that I'm a student of the integrated program at PES PU\n\nI think I'm just overwhelmed by the fact that I'll be joining a college next year I guess, and I'll be shooting alot of questions here in the coming days xd",

It can really get to you.\n\nThe amount of fun you'll have depends on what kind of friends you're able to make.\n\nI am from EC campus and I joined in 2020, so the entire first year was online (online classes, offline tests/exams), so I wasn't able to find a big group of friends like I was hoping to. \n\nRR campus has more clubs and club activities and the campus is bigger and has newer blocks and all.\n\nEC campus can go to RR campus for hackathons and events and campus placements.\n\nOther than the club activities there is no difference between RR and EC campus. The placements and the quality of teachers and all is same. Students from both campuses can watch videos of professors from the other campus also.\n\nThere are 2 major fests every year - Atmatrisha in RR campus and Maaya in EC campus. People from both campuses can attend both fests. \nThese are also quite fun, again depending on your friend group and the artists performing in the events.\n\nBasically, it's quite stressful, but the placements in the end makes up for it."

(Atleast it was till 2020, I'm not exactly sure about it now)\n \nLike the KCET GM cutoff in 2nd round for RR campus CSE was around 600, while for EC campus it was around 2800\n\nBasically in 2020, the 2nd round cutoff for CSE in EC campus was approximately same as the cutoff for ECE in RR campus in second extended round."

He remembered it halfway thru the exam and himself took it and kept it away from him either on the bench or the floor(I can't remember his words). And the phone was in airplane mode throughout . This Aditya told me in his last phone call. The invigilator saw it when only 10mins were remaining for the end of exam. This was told by others in the exam hall. His honesty led to all this. Perhaps if he hadn't kept it out , this wouldn't have happened.\nAditya also told that they r harrassing him, they told him it's better to die than do such things. By the time I reached there, he had jumped. They left him alone after detaining for MPC. No one was with him. The counselor just walked away. Such negligence of the college. They had found his body half an earlier itself before I starting demanding to find him. The police, ambulance were already there. They were telling the police that he isn't their student and to take the body away. Some random person entered the building and jumped is what they told. They just wanted the body out of their campus. They were trying to hush it up. And when I reached they told me I need to sign something ( mostly something that keeps them out of this) , only after that they will take him to hospital and try for revival.\n\nThe college doesn't care for the life of a student. They only care about is reputation. We have filed FIR against the college. Any help or information regarding the incident will help us."
