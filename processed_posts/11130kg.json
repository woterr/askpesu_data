  "content": "I got placed in a company last Thursday. Next day on Friday I got an email from the placement office that 3 candidates out of the 9 were put on \"hold\". What does this mean? does it mean we are no longer offered? I searched online regarding this and the answers say that the position is no longer available. Someone please clarify. The company is a reputed one and not like a startup.\n\nEdit: Just got a mail saying that offer is no longer on hold and all the candidates who have been put on hold are now selects. I thank everyone who gave me advice perhaps it will help others if they are in the similar situation as I was.",

Depending on the forecast for the next two-three years they will choose.\nAlso 3/9 means that they're looking to remove any unwanted resources at the very start. What's their package?"
