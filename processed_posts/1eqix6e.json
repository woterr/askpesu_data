  "content": "Guys, I have gotten into PES RR AIML through PESSAT. I chose AIML even when I was getting CSE since one of my cousins(who has a lot of experience in this field) suggested me. Now that I was scrolling through the comments, I wonder if I should apply for PES CSE at EC which I will get through KCET. The fee at RR this time through PESSAT is 5L and I figured it would be around 3L at least in EC since I would have to lookout for a hostel. So what do you guys suggest, Seniors please hop in! Also what do you think about my decision of choosing AIML over CSE?",

This is definitely the case for ECE. I was in both campuses and maybe a few things are better in EC campus but RR campus is always better in almost every way"
