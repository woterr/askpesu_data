Go to Gigguk’s channel on YouTube and watch every video on 2x speed starting from 2006\n3. If you have time left, go to https://myanimelist.net/topanime.php and read the first word of every page of every manga in order to read as much as possible\n4. Wake up at 6 in the morning and chant “Tatakae” 31,000 times to be blessed by Eren Yeager\n\nDo all of this and you may be able to answer a few of the questions they ask. Good luck!"
