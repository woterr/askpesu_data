  "content": "Until yesterday, I could view my ISA 2 marks, but now only my ISA 1 and assignment marks are visible. With the internal mark signatures scheduled for tomorrow, Iâ€™m wondering if the ISA 2 marks are unavailable for everyone due to the script review process of ISA 2, or if itâ€™s an issue specific to me.\n\nBtw 5th sem.\n",
