  "content": "Hey everyone,  \nI’m currently in 2nd year, 4th sem (CSE) with a GPA around 8.28. I’ve realized that just going by the book might not be enough if I want to land a good placement, and not just settle for some average or below-average package.\n\nSo I wanted to ask—**practically**, what all should I learn and do over the next one year to build solid practical skills and projects? What helped you personally in getting placed well, or what would you recommend to someone in my position?\n\nI really want to make the most of this time before placements start in 3rd/4th year. Any advice, roadmaps, resources, or personal experiences would be appreciated!\n\n",
