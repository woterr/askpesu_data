They just limited the number of electives u can take, they don't provide you any specialized knowledge for your domain. I'm into bioinfo and was checking out a clg offering cse with bioinfo, they just threw in some molecular biology, biochemistry and bioinformatics subjects from the biotech curriculum, it didnt really help u gain specialized knowledge. If u wanna specialize in AI and ML go for masters in it after bachelors."
