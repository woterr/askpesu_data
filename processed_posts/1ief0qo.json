Itâ€™s the easiest subject in the physics cycle.\n\nMechanical is just mindless memorization. It wasnâ€™t hard, but if you start two days before the exam, youâ€™re screwed."

Some concepts like laplace and fourier transforms will really kick your ass if you don't listen in class, so please be attentive and take proper notes, sit in the front bench if you have to and torment your teacher with doubts if you're unable to understand anything. You'll have one easier unit on probability which has barely 4-5 topics and literally just involves substituting values in your calculator. I did better in Math 2, so it depends on the person."
