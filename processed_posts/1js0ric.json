  "content": "Kullu came at 3:50PM and the event properly started at that particular time but wait, after making us wait for so long Stage and Infra decided to surprise us with their poor audio systems in 1st and 2nd floor. Can‚Äôt hear anything in the above stands. Highly disappointing. This is a huge blunder. All of us need a refund along with compensation for mental trauma.",
