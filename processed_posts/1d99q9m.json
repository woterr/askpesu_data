  "content": "Hi guys.I have gotten a seat in PES through PESSAT first round counseling (AIML). This issue is, with my KCET rank (2.5k), I won't be gettingÂ  seat in AIML in the first round KCET counseling itself, but there is a high chance in second round. The doubt is, do I have to give up my PESSAT seat in order to attend 2nd round KCET counseling/ is it not possible for me to attend 2nd round KCET counseling once I submit all original documents by June 30th? Can a senior or anybody please guide me through this?  \n",
