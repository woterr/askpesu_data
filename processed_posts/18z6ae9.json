Nice to know that bugs that existed way back in 2018 are still prevalent today 💀\n\nBut yeah, if it's the same grades showing for everyone then it's a bug at their end. It usually resolves on its own in sometime. \n\nSo don't worry, in all likelihood it isn't your result sheet (unless you're the poor soul who actually got that, in which case F my brother)"
