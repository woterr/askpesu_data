  "content": "This is actually for an esa on monday. I realised today that I didn't write any of the question numbers inside the little box, though I DID shade all the question circles properly. Went to the COE's office and someone from there said it won't be a problem, but I'm asking over here just to confirm once more (and to see if anyone else has done the same mistake).",
