So if you get a better seat you can upgrade, but if you don't get a better seat **you will be stuck with your seat from round 1**. On the other hand, if you take a seat in round 1 and choose not to come to round 2, you can withdraw the seat as well - for a fee.\n\nThis used to be the policy until a few years ago, confirm with a current first year to be safe."
