  "content": "Reflecting on my time at PES over the past few semesters, I can't shake the feeling that we were treated like experimental subjects. The constant changes in timings and test schedules made it seem like we were being experimented on and for what? Juniors don't benefit from it either. Frankly, I believe I could have received a better education at any other college in Karnataka.",

Had completed 4 non stop semesters in close to 14 months with hardly a month or two of offline classes. College experimented us with 5 isa, 2 isa system, irregular credit distribution and what not and when we graduate boom recession hits, with close to 30-35% of students still unplaced. \nHere you are crying about timetables, grow up and adjust."
