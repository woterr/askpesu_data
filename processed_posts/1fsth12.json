For AT last year ( aatmatrisha aka AT is the main fest), they had organised family feud too.   \nSamarpana organised a marathon anol last year. I think it's about volunteering anol, especially during independence day and stuff they have things.\n\nBtw, check out linguista! if you haven't already. We are a club of language enthusiasts and learners !! We are opening recruitments too !!\n\n[https://forms.gle/jxtpFU1Rt7F7T6er8](https://forms.gle/jxtpFU1Rt7F7T6er8)"
