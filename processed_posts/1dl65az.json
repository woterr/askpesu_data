Which means that when a company visits, students from both campuses write the same OA at the same time, students are shortlisted from both campuses without knowing which campus a student is from, all interviews happen at the placement cell together for both campuses and results are also announced at the same time for everyone. There is no discrimination when it comes to campus. You get the same emails at the same time and go through the same process as if everyone is part of one campus."

Don't join some other branch if the intention is to switch branches in 2nd year because it depends on how many empty seats are available + your CGPA."
