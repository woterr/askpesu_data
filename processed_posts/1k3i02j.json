You’d rather eat cardboard with sambhar (and that might taste better) 🍽️🤢\nWifi dies faster than your dreams here 🧎‍♀️💀\nAnd don’t even THINK about using ChatGPT… THEY BLOCKED IT.\nNO FUN. NO FREEDOM. JUST FORMS.\nJoin PES if you wanna live the NPC life with 0 plot twists 📉📉📉\nSave yourself before it's too late 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️💨\n#EscapeTheMatrix #NotLikeThis #SayNoToPES"
