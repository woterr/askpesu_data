      "body": "Chill, it's about as difficult as kcet/COMEDK, way easier than jee, and there will be tonnes of mistakes in the paper. \n\nLast year there were 40 shifts, no normalisation, ranking was more or less random."

    {
      "id": "jmuc13q",
      "body": "There is no normalisation,  extreme lack of transparency, and 40 shifts. \n\nWith approximately 500 students a shift, u _cannot_ apply percentile based normalisation.\n\nIf u feel rankings will not be random after knowing all this... then idk.\n\nI had a rank of ~600 in kcet, met, 99%ile in mains,  and 1300 in pessat ðŸ¤¡"
