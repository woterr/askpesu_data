For instance, if you get Mechanical at first and keep your CGPA above like 9.5 or some really high margin, after that deadline comes you may be shifted to a higher branch like AIML depending on your choice and on the number of seats vacant in given branch.  \nUnless you are a really high performing student, I'd suggest you not to worry about it."
