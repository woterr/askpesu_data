  "content": "So…I’ve spent some time on the subReddit, and I’ve heard nothing but negative comments abt PESU…I have counselling in like 36 hours, and I just wanna know how good is PESU actually? Ignoring placements, is PESU really a bad uni, or is it decent? \n\nI personally LOVED the classrooms when I came in to write PESSAT, and I would’ve loved to join with that impression in mind, but I wanna hear from the seniors if the campus really isn’t that good after all\n\nPS: there’s a running joke in my school (NPS RNR) that PESU is basically a NPS reunion…so some NPS alumni shedding some light on this would be terrific",

      "body": "Basically, the only thing you get to see on the outside is the placements (which are great if you are in CSE at least) which does wonders for advertising this place. There is partial truth to the fact that it does boast about having really great placements with a lot of major companies coming in to recruit students. Apart from that, the other good thing is the syllabus which keeps getting updated frequently so it does keep up with the times and is always up-to-date. But beyond these, it does not have much to offer.\n\nHowever, don't get me wrong but this entire institution is flawed. Bad (and super inefficient) management and faculty who aren't well equipped and qualified fill up this place. Just last year, a whole set of really great faculty members left and the only ones left are the poor ones. Academic pressure is really high, and the newly introduced examination system now forces you to give 25 tests, 15-20 assignments, 4-5 projects, 10-15 lab submissions, and 5 exams PER SEMESTER. As for time, beyond the enormous time given to these deliverables you aren't left with much time to focus on what you want to do or honestly to take a few moments to breathe.\n\nThe research clubs are now almost non-functional, since all the main faculty members heading them have left. As for clubs, some weird thing happened last year which resulted in all student formed clubs to be inherently replaced with teacher headed ones, thus they have control over what activities you do as well. There are like 2 fests that happen every year, although primarily it is only one and the other one is for high school students. Beyond life in the classrooms, there isn't much of a campus since 90% of it is under construction without any kind of open spaces. \n\nThese are only some of the issues that plague this place. I'm sure if you read this subreddit you will find more. What I can say is, if you are getting your preferred branch in PES and nowhere else, only then join here. If you get your preferred branch in other equivalent ranking colleges, its better to look at them. On the other hand if you are here because you saw a PES ad in the newspaper (or all around the city), then you should definitely look elsewhere."

I was never really into getting PES but it always fascinated me since I know 2-3 friends who are in PES Alumni and are doing well in their lives. One of them completed his engineering last year. I too got many doubts when I saw all the stuff going around about the rising fees and intake of PES but never really gave it a thought since no college can be perfect. They were underrated a few years back but not now so they definitely will use their brand to earn!"

Academics is the priority here. That being said, I loved the club I was in and it's given me one of my strongest group of friends ever. \n\nI'm not a fan of the management, but I had some profs who were very influential and rather helpful (I do not know how many of them continue to teach), but I need to give college credit for the opportunities I was given because, quite frankly, things for me are very smooth thanks to that. Unfortunately these opportunities are skewed to favour CS, which really shafts the other departments.\n\nAlso\n>PESU is basically a NPS reunion\n\nKek yes"
