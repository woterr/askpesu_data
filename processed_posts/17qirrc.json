      "body": "No, it is a common misconception that median is always < mean. It is statistically possible! If the values after the median show a lesser increase than the decrease of values before median, then the distribution gets skewed \n\nFor example, for set: {1, 2, 2, 4, 8, 8, 9, 10, 10} , median = 8 but average = 6.\n\nTranslating to placement terms, this means that companies after offering greater than 12 aren't much higher than 12 (maybe 13-15). On the other hand, companies offering lesser than 12 are also offering significantly lower than 12 (2-5), bringing down the average.\n\nNo I am not fun at parties."
