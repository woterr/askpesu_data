      "body": "\"Syllabus\" and \"curriculum\" refer to the same parameter right? xD\n\nAlso, RVCE has marginally better placements, but not significantly better. \n\nThe only factors on which RVCE edges past PES are the campus/college life, on-campus opportunities (from whatever I've heard), slightly better placements and a more relaxed environment. RVCE is more well known across the country because of its ComedK intake, while PES being restricted to KCET/PESSAT restricts its reputation to around south India. Although from a top-level point of view, neither's reputation holds any significant advantage when it comes to jobs or Masters."
