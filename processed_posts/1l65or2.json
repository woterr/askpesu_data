I wanted either that or ECE, but yea.I settled with EEE.\n\nUnfortunately, Pes doesn't have a syllabus/coursework regarding EEE on their website. \nCan anyone tell me what the course includes? Should I continue with EEE in PES or try someplace else?",

If you've chosen EEE out of passion, it should pretty good experience. Though, there are many who call it the toghest B. Tech course. The EEE faculty is mixed with some being very good while others dogshit, but overall manageable. These are the courses for sem3 to give you an idea. Please reach out for any more q's.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x5a9nejunn5f1.png?width=1940&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc631ed7ac6d545a7589cdd7316669c321e2d37f"
