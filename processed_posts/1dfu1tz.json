Wait, almost forgot, you will also need to study the Constitution and EVS.\n\nFirst year syllabus is common for all branches. You will study all the courses I mentioned, along with Python and C. If you are referring to your *actual* first year in CS, you will have (unless the syllabus changes again) computer organisation, web tech, statistics, data structures and another course which I cannot seem to remember."
