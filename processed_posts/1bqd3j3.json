(Just use the calci you'll figure out how ) .\n\nNow one isa is over , one more is left , an 18-21 range is nothing short of disastrous . 8.8 is highly difficult given your first internal scores but definitely you can try to get above 8.5 ish so that your cg is around 7.8-7.9"

      "body": "Passed out in 2023, here are my 2 cents:\n\n1. Attend classes regularly from now on (incase you haven't ) It's perfectly fine even if you don't understand anything. Atleast you'll be familiar with the topics and won't be surprised one day before the exam. But put in the extra effort of participating in the class. That will involuntarily help you to concentrate. (Don't look like an idiot by using your phone. You will have enough time during breaks and after college hours)\n\n2. First year math exams are supposed to be difficult. Not all professors have passion to teach the subject well (I'm grateful to have attended BMS's lectures ). Fire up YT and look for videos with animations or a better way of explaining stuff. Engineering at PES is 70-80% self learning.The earlier you cultivate this habit, the better. Test your knowledge Unit wise. Solve the question bank problems first and then solve ESA papers unit wise. (I wish I had done this. Not required if you're conceptually strong, but definitely helps you in gaining confidence if you haven't mastered the topics)\n\n3. I don't know how the assignment weightage is distributed for you, but for my batch it was 40 ISA, 10 assignment and 50 ESA. If it's the same, then take assignments seriously\n It's 10 marks up for grabs. Don't miss out on this. \n\n4. Forecasting your required performance to attain a required GPA is simply suicidal and waste of time. It's very unlikely you're going to reach the forecasted GPA. Instead start focusing on subjects you are weak in. That's the best way to boost your confidence and surpass your own expectations. I would say, being thorough with all the 5 units and answering reasonably well in ESA (say you've answered 80 marks correctly and unsure of 20 marks, you're assured of B grade atleast in a particular subject in ESA) \n\nGood luck and may the force be with you!"

But for M1,M3 and M4, solving all class work problems + assignment problems + question bank problems is more than sufficient to achieve a grade higher than B. For exam preparation you can look at ESA papers to get an idea on what type of problems are asked from each unit and plan which unit to tackle first"
