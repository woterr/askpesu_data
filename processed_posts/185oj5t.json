They also have a lot of derivations and they're generally considered to be harder. Signal processing is more of a maths subject. Lots of numericals with a lot of calculus. Also, in the coming sems, if you have a specialisation,(if you choose subjects of the same domain) you might have the first pick of subjects in your domain"
