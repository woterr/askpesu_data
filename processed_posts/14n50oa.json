  "content": "Hey guys, I wanted advice on buying a laptop. I am confused about purchasing a MacBook or a Windows laptop (preferably a gaming laptop). I heard MacBooks are known for their productivity and Windows laptop has slow performance compared to Mac. By the way, my branch is ECE. Please help me which laptop would be suitable for my course.\n\nThank you in advance.",

If you're in ECE, you'll have to download tools like quartus prime and wireshark and cuda many of them run only on windows. Also, macbooks can't run most games well and if you enjoy gaming, windows definitely the better option. A GTX 1080Ti should be enough to decently run most games. Go for one with RTX 3060 if you wanna be able to run any app or game you want peacefully at the highest settings."
