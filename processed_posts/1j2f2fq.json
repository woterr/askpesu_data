  "content": "My roommate. My stupid, annoying, perfect-looking roommate.\n\nAt first, it was normal. Just bro things. But then I started noticing him too much. The way his voice is deeper in the morning. The way his cologne stays in the air after he leaves. The way his shirt lifts when he stretches, showing just a little bit of skin.\n\n\nAnd now? Now, when I’m making love to my girlfriend, I close my eyes… and I see him. His hands, his breath, his body pressed against mine. I try to focus. I remind myself that I like women. That I have a woman. But I don’t admire them anymore. Not like before. Not when he’s walking around our dorm, shirtless, stretching like he has no idea what he’s doing to me.\n\nI used to love women’s bodies. Their curves, their softness. But now? Now all I think about is him. His smell, his strong hands, how he pulls his shirt off after a workout.\n\nI ask him the dumbest doubts just to hear his voice, just to watch the way he ruffles his hair when he’s thinking. When his intelligent mouth speaks, I don’t even listen, I just get lost in his dark brown eyes. The way he talks, the way his lips move when he explains something, slow, careful, teasing like he knows exactly what he’s doing to me.\n\nWhen he leans over my laptop, his arm brushes against mine, and it’s ridiculous how much I feel it. When he laughs, deep and unfiltered, I want to bottle up that sound and keep it for myself. When he’s fresh out of the shower, towel slung low on his waist, drops of water trailing down his chest, I have to grip my desk to stay in place.\n\nI came to IIT Bangalore to study engineering, not to have a full-blown sexuality crisis. \n",

Talk about freaky. \n\nNow all that is a speculation proceed with caution. \n\nThere shall be a time where you witness his love and care and longing for you."
