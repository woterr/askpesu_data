Similiarly, if you reject a T2 Intern+FTE IT u can also sit for T2 Core intern+FTE\n\n8)If u get internship which gets converted, you have the right to reject/accept it and sit for FTE as placement cell treats it as just as internship.\n\n\n\n\nThis was posted on Discord by a senior a couple of weeks ago."

      "body": "While this is mostly accurate, the exact policy is whatever the placement cell decides when you ask them lol, since they are very non-decisive with the rules they enforce. There is no clear instruction, but to summarise, these are the broad instructions:\n\n1. For full-time offers, you can have a max of 2 offers. Once you accept an offer, or you have *received* 2 offers, you are kicked out of the applicant pool. Note that this means once you reject 2 offers, you are out of the pool, even though you are unplaced.\n\n2. Once you receive an offer from tier N, you are only eligible for tier 1 to tier N-1. So if you reject an offer from tier 2 companies, you will only be eligible for tier 1 and above. The only exception is the dream tier, where everyone is always eligible.\n\n3. For intern roles, you can have at most 1 offer. After that, you can only apply to companies that offer only FTE, with the same conditions applied as in (1)."

      "body": "I did a summer internship between my 3rd and 4th year. Then, I had gotten a Tier 1 FTE + Internship through placements. A week after that offer, I got a PPO from my summer internship company. This PPO was also Tier 1. However, the PPO is an FTE Only offer and not internship. I rejected the offer I had gotten in placement to choose the PPO. Now I have only FTE through PPO and no internship.\n\nSince I rejected a tier 1 offer, does this mean I can't sit for companies that offer internship-only too? Can I sit for a tier 2 company that offers internship only? How are tiers decided for companies that offer internship only?"

      "body": "An easy way to understand is to break it down. \n\n1. You got intern+FTE = 1/1 internship quota + 1/2 FTE quota\n2. You got PPO for FTE from summer internship = 2/2 FTE quota\n3. You now have used up 1/1 internship + 2/2 FTE quota. Which means theoretically, you've used up all the offers you can receive, and will be pushed out of the pool. You cannot sit for any more companies, regardless of the offer they bring to the table."
