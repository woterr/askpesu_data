They are not very confident to join in cse with spec because spec has started very recently and we don't know about the placement situation and also they think that it might effect me in future while applying for govt jobs like ISRO and all becoz they(ISRO and all) don't specify whether cse with spec are allowed to apply for the job they just mention cse.... Is there anything wrong with this thought?"

      "body": "The placement for cse with specialisation in pes ,BMS ,RV ,Msrit are much higher than bit CSE core anytime ,the median package at bit is 5 lacks this time and pes rv and all is around 8-10 lacks ,the thing is bit not only has very bad campus facilities , laboratories, classrooms it also does not offer good placements while BMS pes rv and even dayananda Sagar are comparatively very better to bit.\n\nThe second thing the criteria for eligibility in isro is btech with minimum 65% score,they offer their exam to anyone who has these criteria and depending on your stream.Now the job vacancies in isro generally require a cse, information technology, information science streams and the specialisation in cse is all included as long as the word \"computer\" is the degree name\n\nWhat i recommend to you is research about the placements in the top colleges in Bangalore and compare it with bit ,find out what college you can get in 2.6k rank and how to make your councelling option list in cet , don't keep cse core in Bit in the first place at all tho.Get the data discuss it with your parents and then make a decision because you'd be spending 4 years of your life in this college and may very well dictate how your professional career is in the future so take this seriously."

I don't think you will need a hostel for these colleges. \nSpeaking of placements, these three colleges have slightly better placements than BIT. You sure can give a try for ise and cse aiml in bms and pes rr. Just keep them at the top of the option list."
