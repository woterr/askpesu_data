  "content": "It would be awesome if some senior could take up the initiative and host a meet and greet on campus... There were a lot of discussions between us before the college started, it would be fun if we you guys can meet up and meet each other IRL\n\nWe can have a RR and EC campus meet and greet independently, and depending on the participation, we can have a off campus meet with graduates and batchmates\n\nP.S Please upload the photos here!!\n\n(Lemme know if any help is required from Mod)",
