  "content": "I don't think I can get it through first round atleast acc to last yr.  \nI have already taken admission through PESSAT for it, it'll probably be converted to KCET if I get it through second round (which is most probable)...So, what if, after the first round of KCET counselling, I decide to join another college (if I assume I won't get in 2nd round as well), then would the fees (except 10k) be refunded?  \n  \nJust want to clarify. I'm confused about the procedure.",
