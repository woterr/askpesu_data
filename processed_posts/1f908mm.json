Plus ur guide can argue to get u better grades or throw down ur grades single handedly, so yes they have the most power, in the end everyone in the panel are their colleagues ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, they have a understanding among themselves. So if u are in their bad books they will fuck ur grades regardless of whatever miracle u show and the opposite as well"
