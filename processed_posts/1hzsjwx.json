  "content": "Extremely low morale, slacked the entire time and given up on JEE. My JEE level is trash but decent level for 12th board and now I'm just focusing on that. I just want this moment to pass on and my goal is PES CSE through KCET, preferably E city because I live close to it. Can someone tell me what rank I would need to get that, any help would be appreciated.",
