Stanford, MIT, Berkeley.

You'll especially find large groups of PES students at places like CMU, UCLA, UCSD, NYU to name a few. Everyone's also in touch with each other, there's a pretty big alumni server comprising students pursuing/pursued their MS and it's pretty active. If you want to find how many studied in a particular uni, get on LinkedIn and search using the University name along with PES. You'll find a very long list. And this is only CS. Once you start accounting for allied programs like Data Science, CE, etc, the list will expand. \n\n>MIT, Berkeley.\n\nThese two don't have a standard MS program. Their MS program if present is an undergrad feeder program. So you'll find less than a handful of students from India here."

      "body": "That decision is yours to make. However, given the same/similar branch across both colleges, I'd pick the more reputed one. A more recognised college in India can elevate how your undergrad GPA is seen. For example, an 8.0 from PES is not equivalent to an 8.0 from IIT; you can google the UCI GPA converter as a sample converter that all UCs use. Additionally, the more important differentiator is that better ranked colleges in India also have better labs and provide access to more opportunities to build your profile for MS. They will have more recognised and reputed profs, a higher quality of research labs and opportunities, access to better resources, etc, all of which help their students to stand out. \n\nIt's definitely not impossible to get such opportunities from colleges like PES - the large alumni base every year is proof of this - it's just that you will have lesser opportunities to do so and you'll have to put in significantly more efforts to find the same opportunities which your IITian counterparts might have access to."

Pes ec cse through kcet is cheap and close to my home and the additional scholarship that they provide makes it even cheaper.

Along with this, I'm sure the opportunities and facilities there will be much better. \n\nHowever, I can understand your reasoning behind PESU EC CSE. Living with your parents and the college being close to home(along with being cheap) can make a huge difference to your quality of life and peace of mind and within Bengaluru, it's a well-reputed college. If you want to go for PES EC CSE, you'll need to work very, very hard for the same opportunities that an NIT might provide you though, but if you're able to do well in JEE, you should be able to thrive there too. PS: PESU RR is also feasible for you if you're getting it, it's not too far if you take NICE Road."
