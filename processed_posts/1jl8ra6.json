  "content": "It's almost everyday I'm reminded that we still live in a developing country despite the claims people like to make about India's progress. \n\nI mean I was just trying to fill my water bottle, when some random chick cuts in front of me, then another and then some guy even pushes me out the way. Like damn guys, relax. This isn't Africa, there's water for everyone! Just give some people the common courtesy of waiting for your turn.\n\nApparently there's a token system for ordering food at GJBC. Never have I seen it in use? I mean, why do I have to claw my way through a crowd, stepping on the feet of my own peers, shouting my order at the guy on the other side of the counter. Why do I have to elbow someone out of the way, just to get my lunch? Why do all this when I can sit and relax until my token no is called?\n\nWe have this shit in malls. These same people who like animals...fight over the same plate of parathas, will wait in a very civil and calm manner until their token number is called. \n\nThe part of it that really irritates me, isn't that I'm being cut in front of. It's the fact that we're all supposed to be graduates from the university that offers the best placements in the state. Saying we're educated would be an understatement. We're the cream of the crop. Yet, it seems we're unable to be the change we'd like to see. We have this stereotype of having no manners around the world, of being crude and uncivil. It's like I'm reminded where that comes from everyday.\n\nI really hate being this. I don't want to shout my order, or push people around. I'm a goddamn educated mf. And y'all are too. Why do we have to behave like animals.\n\nLet's change together, please. ",

Generations of people make efforts but nothing really happens.\n\nThere are about 2L people giving up indian citizenship (in legal ways, not illegal) every year, so there are a lot of people that think like you. Such a number also makes it clear that its not worth a try."
