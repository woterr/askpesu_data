  "content": "in the orientation many things were told, \n\n1. some things had missing details or a catch like they said gyms, badmintons courts and all that are available, but not until recently i found out about the 10k per year fees for them.\n2. other things were straight up lies, like the metro station being just 500 meters from campus. like really? why would you lie so openly\n\nanyways coming to my question, the great vice chancellor also told outta the 365 days in a year we will have only 160 days of college, does this statement have a catch or is it lies again? and are there anything else to take into consideration about this place? thank you",

You usually get about 10 days for Christmas. The remaining are scattered here and there. The 2024 and 2025 batches haven't experienced this because of the late session starting dates which took up their summer.\n\nThe number you said doesn't add up numerically though, but be prepared for less holidays during the year and one large break every 2 semesters. \n\nOh also about all the lies? Welcome to PESU :')"

Idk if it's exactly 500 meters, but it seems walkable. Ps: it'll take another 5 years for that station to finish getting constructed"
