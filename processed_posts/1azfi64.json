There can be issues if you don't maintain 75%. \n\nPES places a higher emphasis on academics compared to other colleges in Bangalore. Since academics isn't your priority I wouldn't suggest this college. Especially not engineering, it only gets harder in the higher semesters."

A 75% (for my batch it used to be 85% btw) is mandatory, failing which you won't be allowed to appear for exams. IMO if you're focusing on sports as your primary profession you should look at more relaxed Universities that support your passion."
