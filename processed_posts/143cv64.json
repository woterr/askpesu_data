I guess you're a bit late to join any centers for a project but you can definitely approach any professor of your liking and ask them for a project (preferably go with a team) and they almost never ask for your gpa. Idk if you're from CSE or are looking to go in that field, but yes, DSA is important if you're going in that direction. I suggest you take up certifications online if you don't get any projects.\n\nP.S.: 5th sem is genuinely easier compared to the other semesters (except one or two subjects). Just work a little hard and you'll be good to go!"
