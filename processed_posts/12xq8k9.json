  "content": "I have many jira tickets with input keys and summaries and other fields.\n\nHow to find similiar semantic tickets for a new input jira ticket . Should I use siamese neural network. Pls also give me advice how to train the network and use propogations.\n\nCurrent\n\n1.Find embedding of all tickets.\n\n2.Get ticket fields of input ticket\n\n3.Feed it into a transformer get embedding of input ticket\n\n4.Use the scikit\\_learn function cosine\\_similarity compare embedding of input ticket summary and other ticket embeddings\n\n5..Find the duplicate ticket for the new input ticket as the ticket with highest similiarity score.\n\n6.I have used a pretrained transformer all-mpnet base v2 .It has worked somewhat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm looking to improve the performance of the model by using another model and combining to create a novel approach.\n\nI was thinking of using CNN or a siamese network\n\nAny advice.\n\nI will give more details if you want.",
