You are marked present only if you are present in the all the three attendance downloads.\n\nInspite of reminders about maintaining 75% attendance for this course also, we find that the attendance is very low.\nPlease note that attendance is being monitored by the S&H office and it is mandatory that you attend all classes regularly. '\n\nPlot twist : This time they sent an excel sheet of who attended last class and who did notðŸ’€.\n\nEVS guys, u got this mail too?\n",
