I am in 6th sem and applied for iot cybersecurity but I am really confused whether to pay or not because in 4th sem it was free for us and now they say some eligibility for free credits and pay for the course if you're not eligible. I am clearly confused. ",

However if you wish to take up additional special topic courses after completing the 6 mandatory credits, they will ask you to pay for it. If I'm not wrong, it is 2.5k per credit."
