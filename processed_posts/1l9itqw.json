  "content": "I am considering ARVR+RTOS for my 5th sem electives. I have a reasonably good cgpa (8.6) and i dont mind 1 somewhat difficult subject. I've been through a bit of reddit scrolling and learning what would the best choice be.  \nI cannot find any real information on either ARVR or RTOS.  \nAre they easy? Are they difficult in some aspects?  \nWould a different choice like DA+BD be better even if it is hectic?  \nAre there any statistics for these subjects?  \nWhat do the projects in both look like?  \n",
