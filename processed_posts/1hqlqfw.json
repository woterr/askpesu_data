Sure I show some tough love, but it's often to help you all understand right from wrong and be more independent so you don't actually need seniors like me.\n\nI definitely don't hate the people who come to me for help. Of course, *all* of you aren't bad. But there certainly are misaligned people in your batch, or people doing things that aren't right or appropriate.

I'm always up for constructive discussions but not when the other person derives pleasure out of something like vandalism.

Its easy to find humour in things when you aren't responsible.\n\n>u think one tiny comment on a reddit post will make some clowns change their behaviour?\n\nThem changing their ways is up to them, not me - I am not responsible for the people they choose to be. Calling people out for doing the wrong thing is what I was raised and taught to do, and I've done so. I've done my bit. Whether they choose to be better humans is their call.\n\n>Oh please name 10 examples of this vandalism level things that freshers have done\n\nI am not referring to vandalism when I refer to past events. I am referring to *all* the inappropriate posts, comments and exchanges that have taken place across various platforms.

Yet, we still entertain questions and doubts from you all and I try to answer as many questions as my time allows me to.

If this isn't respect for your batch, idk what is. \n\nAs I said in an earlier comment: I did not ask for the \"Pride of PESU\" status (which FYI, juniors like you called me). I never consider my advice or suggestions to be the best ones. You're always free to do what's best for you. I just share my experience and insights. They may or may not help you. \n\nMaybe you're right. I should just leave. Since all I asked for in return was mutual respect for the help and support I provide, unfortunately I do not get the same on my DMs and previous comments. If you all don't need my help, I'll just stop helping out here."

I am not sure how you or the others can normalise something as serious as damaging private property.\n\n> you find throwing a bed off so serious\n\nYes, I find it serious because I understood the financial privilege I came from and I'm aware that there are millions in our country who don't have what you and I do. My parents sacrificed a lot to support my dreams, and I'm grateful for everything they've provided. So destroying property has never been \"fun\" for me. The very thought of that would be disrespectful to everything they've done for me. \n\nIf you see nothing wrong in it, you are simply too young and immature to realise the privilege you come from and the value of money. Wait until you start earning and you will then realise how it feels to destroy your own property. Or even worse, when you work your ass off to buy someone something they need and they break it for \"fun\". \n\n> bullied into not having fun\n\nI never said people aren't allowed to have fun. By all means, these are your years to enjoy and we've been in your shoes too. But there's a fine line between having fun and being a nuisance. Breaking property isn't the only way to have fun. \n\nAnd as I said, if you all don't want my help anymore on this sub, happy to oblige. It was all out of goodwill for juniors. If all you guys are gonna do is weird/inappropriate stuff which we seniors have to put up with and yet expect us to help you out, or assassinate my character because you think I shouldn't have called you put on something like this, then sure.

You don't get to see it because we try our best to clean them up before it gets activity. From weird NSFW content to declarations of violence, there is something of everything. So yes, there *is* is a prevailing negative opinion about this batch. As I said in a different comment: the dislike is a little exaggerated but it's definitely not misplaced. We don't hate everyone obviously, but it's hard to like everyone. \n3. Long paragraphs are justified, given that most of these comments went after my character and even called me out as a racist (?). If you think me calling them retards was the last straw, then I should have called it and turned my back on this batch months ago when the freshers started calling me all sorts of things.
