Personally I chose PES CSE over RV ISE because I had gotten more reviews of PES: I had a better picture of it going in. But you'll be well off in both choices.\n\nAlso, I spoke to a prof at Columbia University, he told me that it in India, ISE and CSE may mean the same, but that's not the case over there."
