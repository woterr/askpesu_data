      "body": "Not true, like the other redditor said, the hiring dept wont know which campus you are. Now it comes down to the placement cell, and honestly the placement cell has got better jobs to do rather than segregating RR and EC students. \n\nThe general trend of having better quality students in a larger number in the RR campus gives an illusion that the placement cell has to do something with only giving RR an opportunity, but really its just how you or EC performs. \n\nIf you do well in CP, you have a good resume, a good GPA, the placement cell wont care and will send you forward, regardless of your campus."
