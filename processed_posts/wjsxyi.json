  "content": "I need to buy a laptop, thinking about getting either a macbook air / pro or a higher end windows laptop, partitioning the hard drive and installing linux. I thought it would be smarter to buy one after 1 or 2 sems so that I know exactly what I need, but for now I'm using a very basic HP laptop (30k one, with an i3 processor). Will that be enough for the first 2 sems?\n\nPS: my branch is cse and I'm not interested in gaming on my laptop",
