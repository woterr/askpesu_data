Even for the CSE branch the majority of the students get placed in mediocre jobs and positions.\n\nI could have had justified it at the older fees of 2.8L (which I paid) and the chance of getting 25% scholarship.\n\nBut right now if this costs almost 25L for a btech degree the better alternative would be to save some money and maybe for a MS later. The college does not have the faculty or facilities to justify the fees"

I personally think you could take it if your parents can afford it. (that is, if it's your only option)"

Placements are good if you can stand out in the crowd, the student intake for cse is extremely high so keep in mind to get a good placement you have to keep a good cg, if you work hard you can grab packages above 25-30 lpa easily which is still good roi, so depending on how much you'd like to spend on acads make your decision"

You need to take a holistic viewpoint when you justify the fees, not just the end goal. Additionally, OP's end goal might not be placements at all - what if they want to pursue a Masters post BTech? Then the other options they have will hold weight as well."

There is a pros and cons post on this subreddit - you can see for yourself what PES will offer.\n\nAlso if you want to do MS, then it goes without saying that your Bachelor's degree should be relevant to what you'd like to pursue"

In this case, I suggest you go to some Ivy leagues in the US to pursue Btech as it more than or equal to this heft fees.   \n\n\nAs for the case when you are financially unstable, I suggest you try other colleges that align with your ranks in CET, COMEDK or other exams."

      "id": "jo0j69j",
      "body": "I didn't ask - which branch are you targeting? If it's ECE at PES vs ECE at Manipal, I'd recommend Manipal. If you take placements out of the equation, Manipal is still a very strong choice with good opportunities and facilities which will help you build your profile for MS. And even if you do target placements, last time I looked into stats they had a great record as well. PES is *extremely* biased towards CS and with the large disparity that exists between CS and non-CS branches (mainly due to the large difference in number), you might miss out on things. IMO Manipal should be your first choice, unless other subjective parameters like travel, costs etc come into play."
