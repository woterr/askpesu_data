      "body": "EEE alumni here. Electrical is very math oriented. You will deal with calculus very heavily. Our department values a student who shows interest. I'm not brilliant, but I made it a point to show up and put in the effort. I maintained a GPA above 7.5 for all the semesters after the first year. You're paying a shit ton for tuition at PES, so go annoy your professors until you understand what is being taught. Professors like Dr. CPK will give you more numerical problems to work on if you say that you want to practice. Show up on time, make notes, and pay attention in class. Doing this base minimum will keep an average GPA.   \nI think that the placement department requires a 6.75 or so, but I did not sit for the placement cycle in my year, so I'm probably nor the right person to ask"
