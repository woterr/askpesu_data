  "content": "I have posted this question before but I am posting it again because I am in a huge dilemma. Last date to surrender PESSAT seat is 17th July. First round of COMEDK counselling happens on 18th July. Some people were telling second round of PES counselling will happen on 22nd and 23rd July. I will be out of station during that weekend for personal reasons so I might not be able to attend 2nd round of counselling. My COMEDK rank can get me admission in RVCE or MSRIT in third round. I am not interested in placements because I plan to do MS",
