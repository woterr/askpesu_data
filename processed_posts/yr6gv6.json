But if u r getting PES through KCET with 4 Lakhs Total Fees of the Degree then I think u shld rethink as Manipal is more costly. But if u r getting PES through PESSAT then don't waste 16 lakhs for nothing. Better to pay little extra and get the Bang for your Buck in Manipal rather then PES through PESSAT."
