You can try for NITK or IIITB or RVCE or BMSCE or MSRIT. And also you can check PES Eligibility criteria in their official website http://pes.edu/"

There is way less competition. The campus is green too.\nHowever, if you are a person who tends to be more productive under pressure like me , I'd suggest choosing PES."
