  "content": "\nI'm in my 2nd year and received an email about fee payment stating that only UPI or Net banking via PESU Academy are allowedâ€”no DD or NEFT. However, I have an education loan, and the bank won't transfer the funds to my personal account, making UPI payment difficult. Has anyone else faced a similar issue or can provide guidance?",
