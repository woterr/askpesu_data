      "body": "Concentrate on your subjects from the beginning. This is important in order to get a good cgpa. The management has no relationship with the incidents so there is no \"change\" since they also don't know anything.\n\nCSE is challenging. You will have mini projects for your subjects so you will have hands-on projects. The life you will have will depend entirely on you. If you balance your time properly then you will have a good time, otherwise your life will be full of suffering and pain. I'm not kidding. Focus on your subjects. PES is known to have a much more stringent and higher level of difficulty in their exams compared to other colleges. If you think you can't handle it then choose a different college."
