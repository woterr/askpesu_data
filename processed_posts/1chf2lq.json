  "content": "I have so many doubts on how it works here, I have my first two semesters as backlogs and I read somewhere that I can have only 24 credits worth of backlog to go to next year. I was in my first year and i messed up big time and I still am at the same point where I was in the beginning and there's a backlog exam coming in the end of this month and I'm very under-prepared and I'm freaking out but also totally gave up. Also I heard someone say there is backlog exams coming in July too. If I can't write now, can I write it in July and how much am i supposed to pay for 5 subjects per semester? Can I still go to second year if i clear out one semester's backlog exams? Thankfully the college hasn't contacted my parents about this and lack of attendance. So they don't know about my current situation. I'm clueless and college isn't helping much atm and I can't drop. Help me out on this backlog confusion.",
