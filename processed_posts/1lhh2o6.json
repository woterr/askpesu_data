  "content": "So i had went to the college to submit my documents for psychology but i didn't have my TC and study certificate cus they hadn't given it yet and later they asked proof to show that i studied at the same college for 11 and 12 and I had come from another city so didn't have anything else with me except what they had asked for. I have paid my fee and the lady said I can come between Monday to Friday but I'm a bit anxious cus i didn't get admitted that day and worried if I'll still get in when I go tomorrow. If anyone's had a similar experience or has any idea can u pls let me know???",
