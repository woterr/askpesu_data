      "body": "I think the prevailing opinion is that CSE always > AIML, simply because it's a bad idea to constrain yourself this early. Not only may you not like AIML eventually, you may also find some other domain much more appealing.   \n\n\nFWIW, if you get a high enough GPA, you can try switching to RR Campus in 2nd year. At present though, I don't think there's \\_too\\_ much difference between campuses (definitely none wrt placements) though but someone could clarify that further maybe!"

      "body": "No, we're suggesting to *choose the specialisation when you get the choice in 3rd year*. If you choose AIML now as your specialisation, you **lose that choice**. Because a lot of people are into AIML because of the hype and don't really understand what it consists of. Adjusting will be hard if you end up being forced to study courses you do not like. If you join college and realise that AIML is not for you and you instead like systems or networks, you won't get the chance to change your specialisation cause it's fixed. Core CSE kids will get the option to pursue whichever specialisation they want in 3rd year.\n\nBesides, the current batch of students know that the college isn't equipped with quality staff to teach the subjects."

      "body": "No don't worry about it. If you indeed are interested in AIML and join college and realise that it is what you want to pursue, you'll always get the chance to take up electives and pursue the same specialisation.\n\nBesides a big point to note is that most companies do not recruit ML engineers right out of college. Do a quick Google search and you'll see that most (major) companies take people with atleast a Master's. \n\nEdit: I along with multiple others hold the same opinion, you can go through multiple comments on multiple posts on this very subreddit about the same to read more answers."

But it always comes to my mind if I am making a mistake by not taking AIML in RR campus in pessat round 2 counselling. Taking AIML would mean limiting myself to only one field which I might not be interested in. AIML is full of calculus,statistics in general majority of it is just maths. Considering that I am not good at maths, I've decided to stay with core cse."

      "body": "Honestly if your dilemma is between choosing AIML and CS (and not between choosing RR and EC campus) then the answer is very very clear.   \n\n\nTake CS. It isn't just because other domains are \"interesting\" (although they 100% are and you should explore them), it's also because CS IS A NEW SUBJECT! We don't know anything about how anything works!  \n\n\nState of the art research in *any* domain will show you methods opted in from other domains! Graph theory was thought to be useful only to network engineers and compiler designers until ML people invented graph neural networks! ML enthusiasts thought they could get away without learning how the system works until their models got too big and then they had to learn parallel computing, numerical optimization, and domain-specific language design!   \n\n\nSo yeah. Don't constrain yourself. CS is wonderful, go explore!"

      "body": "Is the advantage of having core CSE course where we can explore and choose the electives of our own interest+Less crowded campus(Also a bigger,open campus) significant enough to overpower CSE(AIML) course which is the most chosen already in RR campus , is more established (the \"main\" campus) and has PESU INNOVATION LAB, slightly better peer quality,bigger fests, better clubs and a little more happening campus? Ik that it will come with the limitation of not being able to choose other electives but the CSE(AIML) does have a bunch of electives(Cybersecurity, etc.). I saw that in the description of the CSE in AIML course listed on pes website.\n\nPS:- For me both the campuses are equally distant also the fees is same(pessat). Pessat round 2 counselling is tomorrow and I am currently in EC campus cse. With my rank I can easily get CSE(aiml) in RR campus."

In fact, our last event was hosted at EC campus lol  \n\n\nLook dude, EC campus is pretty cool. CSE is pretty cool. I don't know how AIML is because it's literally the first year that they're offering it. If it's a new department then it might have its own policies on various things. I just think CS is far too vast to ever benefit from having such a specialized degree in it."

Courses are like Big Data etc. are not even their in AIML branch as electives. In my time they did not even had a syllabus for people to see cuz they were still deciding on it.

But also consider whether you'll be okay with studying aiml for four years in case you're not able to transfer, because it's highly competitive and almost everyone will be trying to switch to cse."
