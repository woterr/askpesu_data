Since u have interest in it field, ull end up having to compete with 2000 (cs+cs aiml) students if u wish for a it related job. Idk about robotics with ai, but it'll probably be something similar to cs. Also bit is not a hectic college either so ull probably get time for studying. But again ull probably not get the same type of campus placement like pes. So it comes down to ur personal choices"
