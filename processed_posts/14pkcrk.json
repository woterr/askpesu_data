Base ram is enough for a student. Even its enough for professionals \n\nDon't buy a windows until your planning to game lol  ðŸ˜… ðŸ™ƒ , still you can run windows Virtually on mac and run that game."

      "body": "I bought an M1 MacBook Pro when M2 series had just come out, and I remember going through a shit ton of reviews just so I could be sure of my purchase. M2 had quite a few problems with the ssd and there wasn't much of an upgrade from the M1 series, so I went ahead with the M1. Don't know if it's the same today. \n\nIt's been a year now and my laptop feels just like it did when I first took it out of the box. Get the M1 MacBook Air instead of the pro because spending an extra 20-30k just for the touchbar is just stupid, trust me. You'll barely even use the touchbar."
