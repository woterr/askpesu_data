This sem will have algorithms, computer networks and operating systems(all have lot of theory) which are important from placements point of view. Microprocessors and linear algebra are the other subjects. \nSo it is kind of difficult especially theory-wise, but mostly everyone in our year scored better in 4th sem than 3rd sem."

Study from the textbooks for os and cn!!!! \nMpca was honestly the easiest subject for me lol, my teacher was great so all I had to do was study from her slides. \nAlgorithms is also easy, but make sure to pay attention in class , cuz you'll need the concepts later on. \nLA was also really easy, just solve 2-3 questions on each topic and you'll be set. Vibha's notes saved my ass for LA."

I liked the subject even though I found it a little difficult. I would say there is some 30% theory and rest is concepts which you need to understand really well.\nOur teacher didnt teach properly from 2nd half(which is more complicated lol), so we had to manage using YouTube only"

Slides were semi terrible. Practice will help a lot. \n\nMPCA: Microprocessor and computer architecture: Easiest to watch a vid/website. Slides and the classes were decent. \n\nCN: Computer Networks: Depends on your teacher. Easy if the teacher is interested in the subject. Otherwise YouTube vids are you friend. \n\nOS: Operating System: Easy if you have an interest in computers, otherwise pure hell. Slides were decent, but if you want to understand things GFG and YouTube are good. \n\nLAA: Linear algebra and applications: LISTEN TO CLASS AND DO PROBLEMS!!! Hard if you are not good in maths. Otherwise not too difficult. Slides were bad (for me)."
