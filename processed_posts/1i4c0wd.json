  "content": "The post older than 8 months shared the cutoff being 98 percentile for cse via jee mains but back then PESSAT was also being held. What could be the cutoff for cse now? Shiksha mentions that candidates can get in through jee and kcet. KCET being for the people of Karnataka ofc. Would be helpful if someone could provide an expected cutoff for cse.",

If they keep Home state quota for JEE too then it's kinda unfair.\nWell, I'm a freshman at EC campus so I have a lot to explore and know before I can say which campus is better. But it's harder to get into RR campus than EC campus through KCET and more events and hackathons happen at RR campus than EC campus."
