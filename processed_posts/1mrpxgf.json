  "content": "I will be getting CS in EC campus in Round 2, my rank is very near to the cutoff of first round(cutoff is only around 200 ranks away from my rank ), so I wanted know to whether I miss out anything. and one more question is do I sit in a class where people r from kcet Round 2, or will I be sitting in a class where the lectures have been started already ? please tell me whether these two things r important, or its okay if I miss them as I did not get a seat yet",
