We Dont know. beacuse we dont have any existing data for any cutoffs for admissions through jee mains (without pessat).This is the first year that we have only jee mains(and cet) for admissions.  \n2)College mess and hostel depends on college , check the reviews on this sub and Checkout the FAQ's in this sub as well.  \n3) I have not seen any discrimination towards north people personally. People in the college dont really care about that much and you will also find diverse amount of people here.  \n4) checkout the  [PLACEMENT 2025 stats](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TfR17y3iPGzHFmCfWGwAXBpwCHvbxEK0wOP_Kx8FOG8/edit?gid=582730064#gid=582730064) , Note : this was maintained by the students and its outdated by some margin because its a very tedious task to maintain that sheet.  \nIF you want reliable data checkout this [Placement data](https://pes.edu/naac/doc.html?file=upload/nirf/NIRF_2025_PES_University_Engineering.pdf) which is from the official website.  \n5) Depends on your interest, CSE in pes here is very good if you can maintain a good gpa throughout your college.IF you really like CSE and u think You want CSE instead of other branches go for pes.  \nPES has updated syllabus , Good textbook recommendations  and references for CSE fundamental subjects and has a good amount(too much actually) of hands on work. What PES really lacks is quality of teachers to teach these subjects and help you with the hands on.I think its best to Research about these on your own throughly and make a decision on your interests.\n\nHope this helps :D."
