What people don't understand is that for your grade to improve, it depends on what your original score was and how much error was there in correction. If you scored an 80, then the only way your grade would've improved is if your revaluation returned a score of 90. Similarly if you scored an 89, you'd need just 1 mark for a grade increase. For most people, their revaled score isn't much higher than their original score so there is no change in grade (although there might be a change in marks)."
