  "title": "[Discussion] Downfall of PES Innovation Lab",
  "content": "Back in the day, the PES Innovation Lab used to *actually* stand for something — a place where passionate 1st year students could explore, build, learn and grow. It was about curiosity, initiative, and potential. The whole idea was mentorship and experimentation, not gatekeeping.\n\nNow? It’s turned into a political circus. What used to be about *nurturing talent* is now buried under layers of favoritism, inside circles, and some twisted prestige complex. The bar to get in is absurdly high — and not in a “challenging but fair” way. The entrance tests feel like they’re designed to keep people *out* rather than bring people *in*.\n\nAlso, somewhere along the way, they silently shifted it into a 2nd-year-and-above-only thing. Like… why? The first year is *literally* when people have the most fire, most free time, and most openness to try new things. But nope, apparently if you're in 1st year, you’re not \"worthy\" anymore.\n\nThe lab used to be a community. Now it’s an elite club with a bouncer at the door and no signboard. Congrats, you took something that could’ve built the next wave of innovators and turned it into a resume booster with a superiority complex.\n\nWeird flex, Innovation Lab. Real disappointing.",

      "body": "This sounds like someone who hasn't been part of lab lmao. Out of several useless clubs in PES, most of 'em stuffed to the brim with useless politics and stuff roles, lab has been one of the few spaces where you can actually do somethign relavent. The exam this year was, in some ways, harder than the other years, but of course cutoffs would have been appropriately remedied. In fact, I would like to dissect your answer in points:\n\n1. So you seem to imply that lab is only for 1st years? Actually, anyone from any year can get in, it's just that people from 3rd  year tend to favour company internships over PES ones. Most other years have their summer breaks after first year (I think covid messed up the schedule, I dunno), so of course the lab cannot consider the first years in mind to potentially derail the entirety of the other years at PES.  It still is about curiosity and potential, it actually gets no support from the management, which means that the motivation is entirely out of dedication to the community, a rarity in any space\n\n2. An environment like that actually has no political motive . There's no substantial money involved, there's no profs children being favoured, interviews are kept unbiased. In fact, I think a friend of mine was told that he'd be interviewed by people who didn't know him, to keep it fair. And there are actually three ways to get in - There's something called the hunt, which is a ctf style event, the tests can be supplemented by the resume, and haschode, which is a hackathon (cancelled, I think, due to time being tight this year or something of that sort)\n\n3. I think my previous points explain the 2nd year only thing\n\n4. We have no money for a bouncer :(\n\n5. Yes, it is a flex to make it in! It's not easy, which makes all the difference, ofc, and leads to salty comments like this one who take it as a personal attack on themselves if they don't make it. Try again next year! It really is a lovely community"

      "body": "That's great for them! Not getting in doesn't necessarily mean they're less skilled or less intelligent somehow, and being in a club isn't the be all end all indicator of success at all. Also, I dont think lowering standards is a good solution to an already pretty open process. I suppose no matter what you do there'll always be people feeling personally attacked by some imaginary problem, and its just a club, for crying out loud. People be rlly hating on a small student run community 😭"

      "body": "apart from negative marking , some companies have everything what you said. they have this + a coding section , where you need to pass certain test cases.\n\nyou need to understand that pil has a very low acceptance rate hence  there are these limits.  \nIts same in the industry 100 or 200 ppl sit for 5 roles/positions.  \n  \npil is not \"j a thing in pes\" , they bring in ppl from industry who have even done Phd's, conduct workshops and talks featuring ppl working in Tech. They have a slight edge on opportunities. i heard akamai had come for pil members last year(not 100% sure).  \nMore over the experience you get there is arguable better than any pes research center."
