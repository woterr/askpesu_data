The syllabus is identical and the exam papers are the same and are written at the exact same time. \n\nThe only thing lacking is infrastructure. And not by much either. Ec campus has a pretty good mrd block. \n\nThere's only one reason the cutoffs for both campuses differ so much: 12th graduates aren't known for their best choices"
