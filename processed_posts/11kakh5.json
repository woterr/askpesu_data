      "body": "It varies a lot over the semesters. Some semesters have easy courses so the minimum SGPA is almost 9 at times, sometimes the courses are tougher and it drops to less than 8.5. Over my 4 years I've seen the minimum SGPA vary from as low as 8.2 to as high as 9.3. \n\nI'd say on average if you get above 8.5 you have a good chance at getting a scholarship for being top x% of your branch."
