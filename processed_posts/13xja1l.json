They also ask parents to keep a closer watch on their children xD.\n\nAlso, college isn't like what's depicted in movies/shows, atleast here. Get that image out of your head before your expectations get smashed to pieces in the first month. Nobody's throwing parties every other week - people are struggling to find time to breathe and relax here from the constant stress.\n\nFests have been discussed before on this subreddit, search and you shall find out more."
