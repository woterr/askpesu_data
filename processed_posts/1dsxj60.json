The time slots are usually 1-1.5hrs long.\nIf you go to the gym anytime before 4 pm, there are no time slots, and you could just stay in gym till 4 pm if you want.\nFor a hostelite it's pretty chill if you r willing to work out early in the morning \nFor day scholars it could be a little bit of a struggle if you don't live nearby"

There is a gym fee which you have to pay to the sports department after which they will give you a card containing your gym membership details. The fee payment is 10k for a year...
