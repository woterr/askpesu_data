      "id": "kfe19i4",
      "body": "Oh no. 8am-7pm is crazy. I also heard that they treat grownup students like school children. I read a reddit post saying that. So i think it might be very strict.\nBut why do need to attend classes for 11 hrs. Are they teaching something special? I don't think we'll get enough personal time."

      "id": "kfedn9n",
      "body": "Right. I asked my friend who is doing MBA through PGCET. She said that as management students are ahead of the PGCET students, to matchup with them they will take extra classes.. i think that's why college timings are 8am-7pm. She said that after 2nd sem it'll be more relaxed and they'll take lesser classes. I also asked her if dayanand Sagar and MSRIM are that good? She said that everyone says they are good but quality of education at PES is better as it is autonomous college. I am very confused about everything right now"

Due to my category, i might get into IIM Ahmedabad or banglore. My only reason for not to go for those colleges is because the fees for those colleges are off the roof. Do you think is it worth the investment of that much fees in those colleges? What's your opinion."
