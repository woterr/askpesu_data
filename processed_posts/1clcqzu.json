Also, the website clearly indicates the amounts mentioned to be for tuition.\n\nThis sub encourages good questions, ones which usually cannot be found by visiting the uni website or by searching this sub. Duplicate/Redundant posts are an inconvenience to everyone. I could've been nicer, but you could have also been precise."
