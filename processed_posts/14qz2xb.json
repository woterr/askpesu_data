After that, you'll be restricted from choosing spz. electives if you choose any of the CSE(spz.) degrees. Other than that, placement-wise, no info yet. This is due to the fact that none of the batches with that degree finished their placement-phase. In general, VTU affiliated colleges are a bit slow. We're in the 2nd semester (about 3 more months left) while PESU would be starting their 3rd soon. College doesn't have red flags as such as of now. Management is pretty great, very organized. But it definitely isn't stress free. 7-8 subjects in the first 2 semesters with 2 internal tests and frequent quiz for internal-internal component. PESU used to have 5 ISAs but I heard that it's now reduced to 3. So stress / pressure wise, it isn't that chill here. I was in PESU for about 1.5 months before I got allotted CSE(CY) in MSRIT  in the 3rd round of KCET.   \nAll the best for your counselling!"

I've already booked a PES core CSE seat via PESSAT, as someone who's been in both institutes, what are the differences you noticed? Which college is better in an academic sense, extracurriculars/ enjoyable college life, placements, better chances of going abroad?\nalso, could I please dm you? thanks:)"
