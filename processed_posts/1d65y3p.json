I understand that PES is not particularly known for its research, but which professor is better than the rest for research guidance in machine learning, specifically in image processing?",

She is one of the best research advisors at PES, but you should know that it is really difficult to get her as your research advisor. She is usually busy with her own research, or has multiple Capstone teams already working with her. \n\nI'd still suggest reaching out with your ideas. She is really sweet, so even if she is busy, she usually recommends other profs who have worked in areas similar to your problem statements. She might even offer to discuss your problem statement and give you ideas if you are lucky."
