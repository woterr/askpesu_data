  "content": "What is this famous debate about the two campuses RR vs EC. Was part of the first round of couselling of day 1 final session. Approx 120 CSE seats at EC campus 70 AIML again EC campus and 110 ECE seats at RR campus. To my surprise CSE at EC campus and ECE at RR campus got filled at almost the same speed and once both closed ppl began chosing AIML at EC campus. Does EC campus come with certain cons or is it the travel distance alone people choosing RR campus over the latter. Woukd wanna hear for a current or ex EC or RR campus student.",
