I think they call ur parents and would cover for ur attendance  by taking extra classes in the last preparaion week before esas.eventually they too let u write the esa .\nI am in 2nd year and didn't see any of my friends/ classmates getting barred from writing esa due to attendance shortage in 1st year."
