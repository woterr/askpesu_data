      "body": "Firstly, what most students loosely term relative grading isn't actually relative. PES reduces the cutoffs for each grade so more students get a higher grade. That's why everyone gets a grade boost, something that wouldn't have happened in *true* relative grading. You can read more details on this in the FAQs. \n\nNobody knows how they determine how to change the mapping between marks and grade because it's not deterministic. And ofc, PES isn't transparent with any of these details either. Just assume the pass mark also drops by 5-10 marks from the original."
