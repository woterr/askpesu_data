  "content": "Okay this might be long but sincerely, fuck the fashion club Meraki. And i know a bunch of university clubs with the most incompetent heads who are completely out of touch with the rest of the team. But Meraki in specific has the most problematic people with the worst ego because why?? They're ‚ú®Ô∏èmodels‚ú®Ô∏è and hence better than everyone else.\n\n These people look good on stage because of the outfits and makeup the design team comes up with. Forget about giving the designers credit, these models take everything for granted, are extremely hard to work with and pass offensive comments about the outfits too(stuff like ew that looks gay, ew it looks cheap etc etc). Just straight bullshit comments that make them think they're cool but in reality makes them sound like a pissy 13 year old.\n I'm not generalizing since there are a couple of decent people but most of them are so unpleasant it pisses me off. And the funniest part? The models having some weird heirarchy going on so if you're not part of the \"cool\" aka rude gang, you'll be alienated and not involved in most of the events. \n\nSo why am i dropping this info here? Hopefully to tell enough freshers to NOT audition for the club either as a model or a designer or a makeup artist cuz the toxicity is not worth it. And also to take out a whole year's worth of frustration. We put in so much work, stay in campus long after classes are done just to finish off the whole team's clothes just to be disrespected  and ofc the club head didn't do jack shit about the whole deal.
