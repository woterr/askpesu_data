  "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve registered for PES admissions through their official website, paid around ₹1200 as the application fee, and received my application form and confirmation email with all my student details.This isn’t for a management seat.\nWhile logging in, they asked me to select whether I’ll write KCET, JEE, or both and further process will be done after the results as per the website... \nEverything seems legitimate—I’ve got my details and confirmation via email. But I want to double-check with you all: is this normal for PES admissions? Or should I be concerned about whether it’s fake?",

The actual admission through KCET will still happen via the counseling process???\nAnyways I've already applied and paid the amount too..Even if it's of no use..I can't do anything 🥲"

The cutoff for kcet in this case would be higher in number.\n\n>The actual admission through KCET will still happen via the counseling process??? \n\nYeah basically the entire thing.\n\nI'd suggest dont apply explicitly for any other k'taka state clg (which are under kcet counselling)"
