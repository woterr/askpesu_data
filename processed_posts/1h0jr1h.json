      "body": "2025 stats till now: around 1100-1200 are eligible and sitting for placements in CS, a bit less than 500 of them have got Tier 1 or Dream offer(roughly 450 tier 1 offers from 80-90 companies, 25-30 dream offers @ Apple - Apple came many more times after the initial 20 they took). Another 250-300ish have got Tier 2/3 offers. There's also like 100ish internship only offers, some of which may convert based on performance. Overall you can say 60-65% of the batch in CS is placed in 4 months of placements(still 8 months remaining). The average package is around 18-20LPA for these(median will be lower- maybe 15-16?)."
