If that doesn't go well, kcet, comedk and pessat, etc are your backups. \n\nComing to your question, unless pes introduces new branches or increases intake there won't be a difference between this times and next year's cutoffs. Cse rr went to 1.2k I guess, aiml rr 2k something and cse ec at 3-4k is what I remember."

I would not recommend to join pes through pessat , if you can get through kcet it would still be fine(you will have better options ). \nYou still have a year left ,start prep for kcet/comedk/jee and join any other college please"
