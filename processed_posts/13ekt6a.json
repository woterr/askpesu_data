Last year cutoff for cse rr was 1.2k aiml rr was 1.8k and cse ec was 3.3k donâ€™t really know cutoffs of other branches, also this year they have added cse aiml in ec campus as well so cutoff might go even lower for ec campus this year\n\nIâ€™ve got same doubt about marks required and imp chapters"

The paper difficulty is surely less than jee and a notch higher than kcet . Subject distribution of questions is almost similar to your other exams like bitsat , manipal , kcet , comedk etc . \n\nPlease join PES only if it's your last option ."
