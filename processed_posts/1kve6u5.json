      "body": "Yes, it can be very unpleasant that you have to lock 5lakhs.\n\nBut college needs assurance that people will join. If someone applies for counseling, takes a seat, and then doesn't join in the end just because he got a better seat somewhere else, PES will be at a loss and remain vacant. To get a guarantee that a student may join, they take this. It is basically like a security deposit. \n\nIf you are really sure about PES, you will pay that amount and block your seat. Else someone else who is in absolute need of a seat will take it."

      "body": "While the principle is sound, I think the issue most people have is the fact that they are requesting the *entire* fee to be paid. I'm pretty sure the criticism would've been softer if they had reduced their amount. Asking for the entire fee (which btw, isn't a small sum) before many colleges have had their counseling is a little extreme."
