Working history could include working on a course project they recognise and remember or having them as your research guide or being their research assistant at their lab or even being their teaching assistant. Usually, profs will not give you an LoR for just being in their class and doing well, and even if they do give one, they don't carry weight. \n\nTo get an LoR, just meet your prof (preferably in person), initiate a conversation and steer it towards what you are pursuing, why you need an LoR and if they'd help you out."
