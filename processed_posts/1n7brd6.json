Just explain him that you will get a book once you get your ID card. \n\nIf you dont want to take print out, take a seniors ID card and borrow it using his/her name. Keep renewing it every 10-13 days. Else penalty will go to the ID card holders name. \n\nPES will soon give your ID cards and once they do that, you can go to the lending library and borrow it yourself."

He may be scary but if you talk to him he'll allow you to wait for card.\n\nAlso, if you are brave enough. Go to 6th floor to his staff room when he is there and ask him if he has any spare textbooks. He usually has 3-4 spares which he gives to students."
