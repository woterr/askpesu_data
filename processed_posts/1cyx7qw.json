  "content": "So I got 23xx rank in pessat and I was pretty convinced I'll get cse in ec campus according to last year's cutoffs. My friend's brother got cse in ec campus and he got a rank around 27xx so I was so happy and excited that I finally managed to get a good college after my kcet and mains were messed up. My parents through some contacts talked to some head of department at ec campus and asked him what branch I would get for my rank. He said cse is not possible. Apparently they reduced the seats through pessat to make room for more management seats or some shit? Idk... Why's there such a big change in cutoffsðŸ˜­",
