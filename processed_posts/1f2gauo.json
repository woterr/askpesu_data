Just in case I don't get CSE in round 1 , I should get it in round 2, but in that time I've heard all the hostels would be booked. How do I book a hostel before that? I called the warden and he said u need an admission letter from college to get a hostel here. Pls tell me what to do.\n\nBtw I'm talking abt the aamatra hostel for ec campus.",
