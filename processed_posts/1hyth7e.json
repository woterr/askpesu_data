  "content": "The clocktower struck nine, the soft chimes echoing through the near-empty engineering building. The mechanics lab was quiet, save for the sound of shuffling papers on the workbench. Dean VK stood leaning slightly against the edge, his round frame outlined in the dim light of the single overhead bulb. His tie was loose, his shirt sleeves rolled up to reveal soft forearms, and his double chin—though he’d always been self-conscious about it—was more prominent as he tilted his head to watch the door.\n\n\n\nThe door creaked open, and in stepped Professor SVV, his stout build outlined by the faint glow from the hallway. His belly pushed against the fabric of his button-down shirt, and a smudge of grease clung stubbornly to his cheek, but his smile lit up the room.\n\n\n\n“Late as usual,” VK grumbled, though his tone lacked bite.\n\n\n\n“I was grading papers,” SVV replied, closing the door behind him. “Besides, you like waiting for me. Gives you time to think about how handsome I am.”\n\n\n\nVK snorted but looked away, his cheeks flushing slightly. “Ridiculous.”\n\n\n\nSVV sauntered over, his stride unhurried, his stocky legs carrying him closer until they were face-to-face. Or as close as they could get, given their rounded bellies. SVV smirked. “You know,” he said softly, reaching out to adjust VK’s crooked tie, “you’re cute when you’re trying to act serious. This little wrinkle right here—” he traced a finger along VK’s furrowed brow— “completely ruins your intimidating Dean act.”\n\n\n\n“Stop that,” VK muttered, though he didn’t move away. Instead, his hand came up, almost unconsciously, to brush at the grease smudge on SVV’s cheek.\n\n\n\n“You’re filthy,” VK said, his voice softening.\n\n\n\n“And you love it,” SVV teased, leaning in closer.\n\n\n\nTheir foreheads touched briefly, and VK sighed, his hand slipping down to rest against SVV’s rounded shoulder. “You don’t play fair.”\n\n\n\n“I never have,” SVV replied, grinning as he cupped VK’s face. His thumbs traced gentle circles over VK’s full cheeks, his touch lingering just under his jaw. “I’ve told you before, you don’t need to hide this.”\n\n\n\nVK frowned slightly, his hand twitching. “Hide what?”\n\n\n\n“This,” SVV said firmly, his fingers brushing over the area where VK’s chin should be. “You’re handsome. And I don’t care what anyone else thinks.”\n\n\n\nVK’s lips parted, but no words came. He wasn’t used to such open affection, least of all directed at the parts of himself he’d spent years trying to ignore. But the warmth in SVV’s gaze was undeniable.\n\n\n\n“Now,” SVV murmured, his voice dropping, “are you going to let me kiss you, or are you going to keep pretending you’re immune to my charm?”\n\n\n\nVK rolled his eyes, but his hands found their way to SVV’s waist, pulling him closer. “You’re infuriating.”\n\n\n\n“And you love me for it,” SVV said just before their lips met.\n\n\n\nTheir kiss was slow and unhurried, their rounded bodies pressing together in a way that felt warm and comforting. SVV’s hands roamed down VK’s broad back, and VK let himself relax into the moment, his insecurities melting away under the weight of SVV’s affection.\n\n\n\nThe sound of voices outside the door snapped them out of their bubble.\n\n\n\n“Professor SVV’s workshop is always open! Let’s check if he’s still here!”\n\n\n\nVK stiffened, his hands clutching SVV’s shirt. “You’ve got to be kidding me.”\n\n\n\nSVV chuckled, his eyes sparkling with amusement. “You’re terrible at sneaking around, Ice Dean.”\n\n\n\n“Storage closet,” VK hissed, already dragging SVV toward the small space in the corner. They barely managed to squeeze inside, their bodies pressed tightly together, when the door to the lab creaked open.\n\n\n\nInside the cramped closet, SVV’s breath was warm against VK’s ear as he whispered, “If we get caught, I’m blaming you.”\n\n\n\n“Shut up,” VK hissed, his cheeks flaming.\n\n\n\nThe students poked around the lab for a few minutes before leaving, laughing about something. When the coast was clear, SVV reached for the doorknob but paused, turning to VK with a grin.\n\n\n\n“You know,” SVV said, straightening VK’s tie for the second time, “I think we’re getting pretty good at this sneaky thing.”\n\n\n\nVK gave him a long look before muttering, “You’re going to be the death of me.”\n\n\n\nSVV’s grin widened. “But what a way to go.”",
