  "content": "A small academic flex :). I'm currently in my fifth semester, going to the sixth. Started with a 6.95 in my first semester, but I've comfortably pushed my grades above 8 (slightly under 8.5, goes higher with an S from a 2 credit summer course). Feeling proud of my progress! However, that one bad score continues to nag me.\n\nNow, looking ahead, I'm wondering if there's hope to reach 9 during the 6th and 7th semesters? Please advise me on the same.",

Aim for a 10, you'll end up getting less than it mostly but it helps you finetune your mindset. Make sure you take 2 credit courses like CIE and aim for an S in them, they really help! \n\nFor me, the jump in my GPA was due to performing very well in my second semester(9+) which evened my GPA out. Since then, I put more effort into strengthening my basics through projects and working on DSA while maintaining a decent SGPA. Since you're in sem 4 now, make this the semester that raises your grades to a large extent."
