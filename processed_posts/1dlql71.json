Or is it all conceptual based on understanding? Any idea about the second and third year courses for CS and/or AIML? Are they mostly conceptual or is there rote memorisation involved as well?\n\nBy rote memorisation, I mean the kind of \"ratta\" you did for stuff like SST and Bio in school, you know, learning definitions, paragraphs, differences and all."
