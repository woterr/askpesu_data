  "content": "Guys how are the PES placements this year for core ECE companies. What is the scene for ECE students? Which top companies visit our college(RR campus) for placements and what % approx of students are the ones who get placed in tier 1 ece companies.\n\nI'm a fresher here and I'm desperately looking for a heads up on this and how I can considerably improve my chances of getting placed in core ece companies. What are some things I should keep in mind if I'm targetting package of around (30-35lpa +)\nIt may sound unrealistic and everything but for once just be brutally honest and guide me on what I need to do exactly do get there. All guidance is welcome, particularly seniors and alumni\n\nOh yes and the placement office, I see it everyday, what exactly happens there?",

At the worst case an RVCE level college.A more realistic expectation is to clear GATE  or crack a top masters school abroad and to then try to meet those expectations."

Or in getting a good cgpa?"

      "body": "Around 25-30 ppl got placed(in campus placements, exclusively core ece)in 2025. 2026 batch is facing the same issue, moreover the process is completely random and is completely based on luck and how well a student cheats in the placement test. One can't rely on their merit, hard work and practical skills. Cuz if u r honest and have worked hard for 3 years hoping that it will reward during placements, u should remember that u r competing with those who r really good at cheating. They can score more than the genuine guys,10x faster. I'm telling this cz the students who have been doing good in their academics , projects are not getting shortlisted for interviews. They rarely get shortlisted. College doesn't take any responsibility in providing fair opportunity , If u want to get what you want u should have the courage to cheat(inexperienced cheaters have more probability of getting caught). So if u r aiming high, work hard and learn to cheat. Otherwise ur hardwork, honesty will be buried. If you r aiming for masters this is a good place, study well and target good colleges."
