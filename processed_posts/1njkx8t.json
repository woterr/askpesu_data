But now, after talking to older students, I'm hearing it's more like 45-50%. Plus, the 2029 class is gonna be huge, like 3500 students, and they're even adding more AI seats this year! It's gonna be a disaster.\n\nThis whole AI boom, the huge intake, and the IT market situation are seriously scaring me.\n\nI'm not sleeping well after investing 28 lakhs, especially since we're a middle-class family."
