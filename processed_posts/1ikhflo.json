Sem4 Subs till now are completely theoritical and core as well."

      "body": "wrt to second year idt it would be too difficult as long as you put in efforts to understand concepts and not study  just for the sake of exams. There will be subjects that are hard and that you may not like (WT,DDCOðŸ¥°ðŸ”«) but there will be some really interesting subjects too.\n\nSem 4 has a little more theory than sem 3 .I remember my senior telling me sem 4 would be scoring but they did absolute grading for my batch and not a lot of people did well. Speaking entirely academically this semester has a lot of useful subjects placements wise (OS,CN,DAA) and it would be better if you strengthen those concepts as and when you study it while you still have time.\n\nThird year just becomes cramped up depending on the electives you take (but honestly all of them atp have quite a lot of assignments/hackathons etc), and it becomes hard to score just becuase of the 1000 submissions waiting for you + placement prep that dont let you study.\n\nOverall up to 2nd year its still easy to score because you have time to put in effort. 3rd year is mostly trying to keep your cgpa from plummeting.\n\nAlso this comment is written assuming you'd be putting consistent efforts into studying (as much as possible lol I get that its hard to find time) , it will be hard (not impossible though take that how you will) every semester otherwise.\n\nThis is a comment on what to study for 3rd sem if you're interested in checking it out :)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/1fwndo6/comment/lqkj4k6/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/1fwndo6/comment/lqkj4k6/)"

But generally speaking i donâ€™t think itâ€™s impossible , youâ€™ll have 2-3 subjects youâ€™ll really like and if you put all your focus on that and slightly focus on the others you can still get 9+\n\n\nThe general strategy for me has always been do well in the Isas as much as you can and give yourself enough room to at least get a comfortable A. If you think you can get an S in the subject , lock that down."
