      "body": "-When I joined PESU , RR campus closed at below 800 ranks and EC campus closed at 3k rank for cse. However the situation has drastically changed since then , both campuses have increased their intake and right now CSE at RR closes at 1.6k CSE Aiml closes at 2.6k, CSE EC closes at around 5.6k and CSE aiml at EC closes at 6k+. Back when I joined there was a difference in peer groups I guess ,but the difference in peer groups will be more pronounced now. That being said if you come to ec campus and have the exact same cgpa and skill set as an rr campus student ,you wont be treated differently in anyway wrt Placements/Internships.\n\n  \n-Teaching wise both are roughly the same (nobody listens to the class anyways), we have the same study material, same av summaries to give a gist of each topic .\n\n  \n-Infrastructure wise Ec campus was slaking when i had joined but since the student centre has opened up here ,we also have pretty nice recreation centre which includes top notch quality gym, badminton courts, table tennis, pool tables, a running track ,chess ,carrom all of which is indoor btw. Classes in both campuses are the same , a large room with 60 students in each class , a tv in the centre and boards on either side. Library in RR campus is definitely better. EC campus however is more open and is far less crowded compared to RR campus. EC campus' location is a major flaw though, situated on a literal highway , you will need to go all the way to EC or Kormangala for decent hangout spots. RR campus is much better in that aspect ,it is well connected also ,although metro connectivity is coming soon to EC campus, the station is at a walkable distance from the campus whereas in RR ull have to take another bus from the metro. Fests in RR campus are better but wont make a difference anyways since both campus students can attend the either fests. \n\n-Personally if I was going to join now , I would first look at the fees . If I was getting PES EC campus through CET and PES RR campus through pessat , I would blindly go to Ec campus , pessat fees now in nearly approaching 20 lakhs for the entire degree, you are getting nearly the same experience, and exactly the same opportunity at 4 lakhs ish through kcet at EC campus . If fees is the same then I would consider travel time next. If all the parameters are the same then I would have joined RR campus for the better peer group . Your priorities , Financial situation may be different ,I hope my answer helps you make an informed choice."

If yes, can you please provide data if you have it."

      "body": "In my batch there are 720 students in RR campus CSE and 600 people in CSE EC campus and around 120 students have been admitted through lateral entry in both campuses combined so thats 1440 students there was no AIML seperate branch. Rn the intake is 720 students in RR CSE ,480 RR CSE AIML,720 students in EC CSE and 240 in EC CSE AIML. Im not sure of the intake through lateral entry now, so even if you assume that no lateral entry seats were added, which is probably not the case, there are 840 more students. Realistically they would have added 120 more students through lateral entry and now the intake is a whopping 960 more students than my batch. \n\nThe point I was trying to make is that the quality of students entering EC campus has changed alot since my batch which you also may want to consider while picking your campus. Ig the huge change in cutoff also is because of increased intake by adding other branches in other Bangalore Colleges like BMSCE and MSRIT.\n\n  \nOn a side note the 720 seats you see the matrix, is like the total intake KCET+ PESSAT+ Management ,out of which 288 are alotted for kcet and there will be further reservations applied on these 288 seats."
