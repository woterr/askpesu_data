Clubs help you indirectly by helping you network with similar-minded people and provide you with a platform to develop your soft skills. Taking part in club events will also expose you to various niches, which may or may not benefit you - depends on whether you *individually* pursue those niches. Just attending events and being in a club adds zero value because no company or admission board will be impressed by seeing \"X club, PES University\" on your resume."
