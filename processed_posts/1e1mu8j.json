  "content": "\n\nI'm currently facing a tough decision between Ashoka University and PES University for pursuing cs. I'm really torn because while I value the potential for strong career prospects after graduation (which PES seems to offer), I also want to ensure I have a fulfilling college life that includes my passions for sports and theatre. Has anyone here attended either university or faced a similar decision? I would greatly appreciate any insights or advice you could share to help me make an informed choice.\n\nThanks in advance!",
