  "content": "If you have a Discord server with your PES mates, you might want to consider adding the [PESU Academy bot](http://bit.ly/pesu-academy-bot) to it to stay up to date with not only **PESU announcements** (sometimes faster than the app), but also **social media updates** (Instagram as well as Reddit) from *every* club at PES. To the best of my knowledge, this is the *only* student-maintained bot that offers this functionality.\n\nIt also has a few other handy tools to allow you to look up **information about a faculty member**, or search for any student from the publicly available database. If you are an admin, you will also be given access to a few handy features to help you manage your server as well.\n\nThe bot is completely open-source (which means you can see for yourself that I am not stealing any of your data) and is free to use. The bot is actively maintained and updated with new features all the time. If you would like to view the source code and/or contribute, you can view the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aditeyabaral/pesu-academy-bot).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[PESU Announcements](https://preview.redd.it/loviv4xfxae71.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5597617eede895b8cf6346f65e6022d9377f6a2)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Social Media updates from Clubs](https://preview.redd.it/pmz4ni0kxae71.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=2649cc1019ee9b4e3e9bee3008ca3146476e58b1)",
