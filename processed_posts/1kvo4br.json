  "content": "I paid the seat blocking fees a couple of months back, they said if I want to cancel admission. I will receive everything back except 10,000 if cancelled before July. Now, they're asking me to pay full fees and I'm not even sure if I want to go to PES, yet to hear from some colleges. So, what do I do here?",
