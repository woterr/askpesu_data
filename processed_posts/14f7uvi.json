It was turned into a full fledged branch because it was the perfect cash cow for PES to trick people riding the hype to take up the branch. It was introduced only last year, so no official syllabus exists.\n\nIf you want to see the syllabus for MIDS for which it was based on, only the electives in third year are different. You can join the main PESU Discord and access the latest syllabus that was followed by the most recent batch that finished third year."
