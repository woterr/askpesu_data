These guys were legit too much during the whole tournament, during the football match when one of their players got accidentally fouled by a cs guy over 20 nursing students went and almost beat up the guy who fouled , the bouncers and the ref had to come and clear it up , during a match against aiml dept theses guys straight up were harassing the other players outside the field . Foul play and slander are common in sports but there should be limits for that too."
