  "content": "On reaching out to the warden of PESU RR over the phone I am informed that there are no vacancies there in the hostel which is within the campus. There is one outside campus costing Rs 2.2 lakh. I think it is a private one with which PESU has some tie-up. However more details he shall share only after admission process is completed. Is anybody aware of details of the PESU RR Boys hostel outside campus? Please share. I need details like:\n\n* Detail Text address, Google location\n* Commute facility between college and hostel. Does it cost extra / is included in the Rs 2.2\n* Photos of the rooms. ( Twin sharing, attached bathroom). Room size and what furniture and other stuff is already available etc.\n* Wifi availability\n* Hot water, electricity back up etc.\n\nPlease reply.",
