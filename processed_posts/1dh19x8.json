If you are ready to work your ass off be in the top 20 percentile then only join PES or else go for BMS"

But I have a strong gut feeling that I'll face hell there. My school life was strict af.......and my mental health is fucked up. I don't want to relive it again. Also that doesn't mean I can compromise on placements. Bms is itself and amazing college with a better homely environment and good placements. That's all I wantüò≠. After paying a visit to both PES and BMS I'm more convinced. A senior from PES was like everything is good here blah blah\n........but I'm never looking back at it again.......\n\n\nIdk bro just tell me what you'll choose¬†"
