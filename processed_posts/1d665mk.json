So, I'd have to completely skip comedk abd only hope for kcet then. I don't know how all this works-"

      "body": "Okay, yeah- exactly what I was thinking, thanks.   \nThe only problem is: to get bmsce core cse, ALL rounds have to get over, as last year that's what happened. Plus, comedk fees are higher.   \nHowever, in case of PES EC, last year through round 2, it was possible to get cs. And, here fees are lower."
