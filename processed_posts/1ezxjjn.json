  "content": "Hey everyone!\n\nI graduated some time ago and I’m working on an app to help people find others with similar interests to hang out with and do hobbies together. Initially, I built it for people after college, since staying connected and finding buddies can be tough. But talking to a junior who mentioned he sometimes has the same problem even in college made me realize this could work well for students too.\n\nThe use cases can be finding people for your clubs or fraternity, prepping for interviews or career mentorship with seniors, sharing notes, or even finding someone to play a sport with. I'm launching on September 20th, and I’d love to get your feedback. Do you think this is something you'd use? Let me know—any input would be super helpful.\n\nIf you're interested and want to know more, you can check out [www.aroundu.i](http://www.aroundu.in/)n Any feedback would be super helpful.\n\nThanks in advance.",

But to answer your question, no I wouldn't meet someone off reddit unless they were from PES (initially I thought the app was only going to be for PES students). and yeah discord servers won't be beneficial for the examples that you've mentioned in your website too (for eg: looking for a roommate).   \nI've come to like the idea now lol, apologies again. just signed up w/ my email.\n\nP.S. there's a spelling error at the very end of the homepage, I think you missed the 'a' in 'Banglore'"
