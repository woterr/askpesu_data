      "body": "Pick whatever course you like more. If you like them equally or have no preference, probably better to pick RV.  \nKeep in mind that you can go from CS to ECE if you're interested. \n\nI was in the same situation 4 years back and I went with CS. Glad I did because I would've flunked ECE bigtime."
