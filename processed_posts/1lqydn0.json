DDCO: EPD unit 3 on steroids basically, revise your logic gates, USE THE TEXTBOOK and a youtube channel called all about electronics + Neso Academy, make notes, do tb qs and listen in class.\n2. AFLL: Don't need to listen in class, Watch all Preet Kanwal ma'ams videos on pesuacademy you're set for exams.\n3. DSA: listen in class, don't mug up codes, build logic by scribbling out dry runs of codes, will help tons. make notes in class\n4. web tech: trust me on this, Anchor Slides + Anchor Code Examples = S grade, pyq too\n5. MCSE: Easiest by far, slides + cw = S\nStart studying 1mo prior to ISA"
