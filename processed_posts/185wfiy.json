SO WRITE PESSAT don't underestimate PES."

      "body": "My two cents as a first year:\nIf you're really passionate about the course (or placements for that matter), then this isn't too bad a place. The first year is a breeze so far but from what I've heard it gets harder, so I can't say.\nThey're pretty thorough with the coursework but they're also a bit academically strict, so pick your poison. BUT coming to the second part of your question, the crowd is fantastic, there's all kinds of folks and you'll definitely find your people."
