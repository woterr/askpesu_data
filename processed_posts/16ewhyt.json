Once into the software industry, branch does not matter.\n* PES has amazing placement opportunities with good academics while the college life is very poor.\n\nBased on my learnings, I would suggest you to go with BMS if you are academically sound. 4 years of my college life sucked and I regret it to this day. One should definitely enjoy his/her engineering days. On the other hand, if you think you need more opportunities to earn more from day 1 of your job, PES is fits well."
