  "content": "So I paid extra for a VIP pass at Pro Nite‚Äîbecause clearly, I enjoy wasting money for fun. Thought I was getting exclusive access, but apparently, all you really need is a torn wristband and zero shame. I literally watched people shamelessly stroll into the VIP area like they owned the place. And the best part? The volunteers eventually just gave up and left. Yup, the so-called crowd control dipped, leaving us to enjoy our ‚Äúpremium‚Äù experience in a sea of chaos. Honestly, next time I‚Äôll just buy popcorn and watch from a distance‚Äîit‚Äôs cheaper and way less frustrating.",
