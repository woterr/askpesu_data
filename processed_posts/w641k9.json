  "content": "I think a megathread with info on branches, exams, clubs, and other common academic questions (this can have links to r/Indian_Academia and related subs too) would be pretty nice and probably reduce repeated questions and help people who dont have (or want) to have reddit account to post. Happy to help if mods all alright.",

For the computing related courses in the first year, and for accessing the PESU academy app, is a personal laptop necessary? Can the computers in the labs be used for this purpose? Can students access the computer labs after class hours if they want to work on their projects and for self-study in coding?"

      "body": "The computers in the lab do not remain open all the time, and if I remember correctly they all close by 5:30-6 pm (although this was 4 years ago so things could have changed). So the labs aren't exactly an option. However, until the labs close students are free to use them.\n\nAlso all study material - PPTs, notes, lecture summaries etc are made available on the PESU Academy website (not all website features are on the app), so everyone uses it to study as well. Studying on the app isn't really a feasible option.\n\nGetting a personal laptop is highly recommended since it is not only required for the CS related courses in first year, but will anyway be required going ahead from 2nd year."
