      "body": "I don't necessarily think the quality of students will change\n\nPESU will maintain its current position of being among the top 3 in Blr, with low recognition in North India / most states outside KA. So the students going into PES will be (mainly) those from Karnataka with JEE scores too low to go to IIT/IIIT/NIT, BITSAT scores too low for BITS.\n\nAdditionally given the fee difference, these students will have second thoughts joining PES through JEE unless their CET/COMEDK's are low and they cannot get RV/PES/BMS through this.\n\nSo the students who'll end up joining PES through JEEM (acc to me) will be the exact same as those joining through PESSAT. ie the kids whose options are Karnataka Unis only + have lower CET scores"

I highly doubt the sole reason for PESSAT's cancellation is this bc as you said - PESSAT was their cashcow in more ways than just the fees. If they wanted to keep the exam, a little money in the right direction I feel would've done the trick."

VIT is quickly losing popularity due to increased population, decreased placements and increase in suixxides. PES has also been falling off the wagon in all of these 3 aspects and the prof quality has significantly reduced. Unless they pickup on these aspects + more (curriculum design, evaluation structuring etc) they'll looked over anywhere. They'll have nothing to offer"

There are lakhs of people writing jee, so there is more chance of non kcet/comedk seats filling up."
