  "content": "Hello !\n\nI'm planning to apply for masters but not who to reach out to for LoRs? I'm getting one LoR from my captsone advisor but not sure who to get the others from since I've not worked closely with any other Profs. \n\nI have the following doubts : \n\n1. Is it fine if I request it from Profs who have delivered a course for which I have S grade and have done a good project for the course? \n2. Is it sufficient to draft an email requesting for LoR or should I meet them in-person ?\n3. Would the profs generally agree to submit LoR for all my apps or should I reach out to different Profs for different apps ?\n\nThanks a lot for the help !",
