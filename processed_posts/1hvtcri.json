      "body": "Here's a list of all RR campus organised fests (atleast whatever is on my mind), existing ones as well as discontinued/paused, ordered by timeline: \n\n1. Prakalpa: Intra-Department Project Exhibition, usually organised around Feb. Organised by respective departments. Yet to return since COVID. \n2. Epsilon: Intercollegiate science fest, organised in early March by first years. Yet to return since COVID. \n3. Aatmatrisha: Techno-cultural fest, arguably the largest fest for students which goes on for a week. Organised by 3rd years around March/April. \n4. The Amateur Scientist: Inter-school science fest, the largest fest in terms of pure numbers and budget but isn't meant for students. This is PES' primary marketing campaign and was unofficially known as the Tinder/Bumble for PESU seniors and juniors. It's usually organised in late August by 2nd years. A variation of it returned this year (TAMS). \n\nI'm missing a few surely (like chords but not enough info at my end), and I'm not too sure about the timeline for ECC fests. Maybe someone can reply to my comment and add info for them."
