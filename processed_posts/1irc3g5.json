These teachers don't allow me to open laptop or tab during class,  even C class they want us to write the code and open laptop \"only when mam asks\". I am aiming for 8+ cgpa,\nThat's enough for me. I can get that by studying 1 week before the exams. So I don't want to sit in class and waste time staring at the board. I don't understand what these teachers teach anyway. I do better when I study myself."
