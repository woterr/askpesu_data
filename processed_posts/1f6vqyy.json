I was a CBSE student from 5th till 12th in Karnataka and I have multiple study certificates (not just 1 like the text here suggests). What are you guys doing? Do you have ONE single certificate that confirms your study in KA for >=7 years?",

Get the study certicate until 10std signed and sealed by the BEO under your school's jurisdiction. Similarly get 11th and 12th study certificates signed and sealed by DDPI falling under your school's jurisdiction."
