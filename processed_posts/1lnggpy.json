I had a few questions:\n\n1.Are these the same as the internship we have to do in 7th sem?\n\n2.Are these internships the ones that can get converted to a full time job?\n\n3.And when will we have to start writing placement tests etc.? Will it be in the 5th sem itself?\n\nI'd be really grateful if a senior could clarify, thanks üôè",

Rare for summer internships to get converted into an FTE, but there is a possibility, If they like your work, you will mostly be called back for a Spring internship in 8th sem, which has a higher chance of getting converted to FTE.\n3. Placement and Spring Internship tests begin in late July after your third year ends. Summer Internship tests start arriving as early as mid 5th sem and go on till April of your 6th sem."
