And the curriculum/professors would roughly be the same ~~quality~~ lack of quality. \n\nThey'll all have pretty much the same opportunities, and the same kind of companies visiting. \n\nI think you should pick solely based on things like campus, location and stuff. \n\nDon't take electronics in a tier 2 college unless that's what you want to study"
