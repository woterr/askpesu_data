  "content": "Hey guys I've got CSE in PESU EC Campus, I am in search of options to stay near campus(<5km) other than the Amaatra Hostel(My father didn't like the idea of accomodating 4 students in a room). I with my father visited the Maruthi \"student\" PG that is alongside the campus and saw some dudes smoking there def not students, so yeah\n\nDoes anyone here know the other alternatives?",

      "id": "ijftpvq",
      "body": "Yeah ik there are 4 beds and when you call them they'll tell you it's 4 person per room but it's actually 3, trust me i stayed there xd. Idk about this year though but it's highly unlikely that they'll make it 4 per room. \n\nRooms are decent imo, if you just give a visit to campus hostel and look into rooms, you'll feel amaatra rooms are far more better. Amaatra has its own pros and cons. It's upto you now. Wish you the best."

And I personally felt I would develop a bit of claustrophia even though I don't have it rn. In my opinion you should check it out yourself once then decide.\n\n\n\nAbout the mess section, like any other hostel don't expect the food to be like your home's food. The other things are same like other hostels..."
