If your backlogs have over 24 credits, then you won't be going to tje next semester and would have to wait until the next semester's ESA. 3rd sem I think has 22 credits in total + a 2 credit special topic. That's right on the edge of 24 credits but I don't think you'd fail in all of them bro, hope for the best ðŸ¤ž"
