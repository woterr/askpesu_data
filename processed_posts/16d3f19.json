  "content": "Dear friends, \n\nThose who joined via R1, is there any additional fees to be paid at PES (excluding the KEA specified fees via challan to be paid at Bank) and what is mode of payment\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI called PES admissions office and they said that they have not been informed by management!  I told them that since R1 admissions already completed, they should be aware already. The lady then said total fees for KCET is around 1.6 lacs\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut the PES website does not mention this total fee  [https://pes.edu/kcet/](https://pes.edu/kcet/)",
