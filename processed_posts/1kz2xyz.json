  "content": "Hey everyone!  \nI'm likely joining BTech Biotech at PES and aiming to build a strong profile for MS abroad. I wanted to ask a few things from seniors or anyone in the loop:\n\n1. Does PES support students going for research internships like IAS, JNCASR, DAAD WISE, etc.?\n2. How flexible is it if I want to work on external research/projects?\n3. Is it hard to maintain 8.5+ CGPA here?\n4. Any biotech-specific exchange/summer programs that are worth aiming for?\n5. Do profs support students doing research outside class?\n\nTrying to plan my next few years right ‚Äî would really appreciate any input üôè",

When I was a student, the teachers were very supportive about the research internships you mentioned and if you also wanted to work under them in college. I would reach out to them from your 4th semester because most teachers expect you to know what‚Äôs taught in the 3rd semester before you can start your own research.\n\n2. I don‚Äôt know what you mean by external research but if you want to work under a different prof outside PES, you can do so in your own time.\n\n3. No\n\n4. Look at IIT and IISER‚Äôs summer internships."

Your competitors are good and connected sitting in JNUs, IITs, IISERs and not to say anything bad but research support is dwindling at best at PESU.\n\nExternal works of course if you can get and manage.\n\nNo idea of high GPA but do keep 8+ if you want a scholarship.\n\nApplying for the summer internship after working with your profs might get a shot\n\nFinally profs support anything till you get a Scopus cause that's incentives ü´£, but be careful cause a retraction will kill your application abroad forever so ethically do the best you can."
