  "content": "Heyy Seniors. We're asked to choose our electives by 30th May, and I'm very confused about choosing them. Looking at EFT, I've thought of NOT choosing WiNC domain. And I'm confused between SpaSE & NICE. Hence I would like to know which among these are easy to score, has good teachers, better scope in future. Heard few subjects don't have exams, rather just the projects. Saw a few reddit posts which said QEQP and CLP are easy. And few said DSD and FFVDD are good. Gpt said ANN and SNLP are good and easy to score also. \nPlease help.üõê",

Some of my friends had taken the NICE specialization and they said it was good.  \nAs for WiNC, idk much about it."
