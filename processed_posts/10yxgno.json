I have a pretty average cgpa (less chance of acceptance and scholarship) and kinda worried about investing a huge sum on it. \nSo I started researching about GATE and wanted to know  about any personal experience or journeys of any seniors you wrote GATE or pursuing M.Tech in any IITs/NITs.\nAre M.Tech (CS) worth these days , I was reading a lot of negative reviews on them (Average placements, huge partiality between B.Tech and M.Tech students).\nIt would be great for suggestions on what I should pursue (MS abroad or M.Tech in India) .\nI also want to live the \"college life\" , after spending more than 3.5 sems online I really haven't experienced the college life about what I have heard or seen from my other college friends .\nThanks in advance.",
