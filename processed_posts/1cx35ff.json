Some clubs are there if you want to join.  Scholarships are there for top 5% and top 20%. Most lessons are video taped if you want to hear it. All slides are available on their web site. That's pretty much it. If you want to have fun, then it's up to you. College has rules of no copying. It's fair enough"
