  "content": "I've read many people say that VTU affiliated colleges are bad and one should go for autonomous colleges if possible.\n\nBut I want to know if autonomous colleges are more costly than VTU colleges. I read a review about a autonomous college where they stated that that college was asking for money at every chance they got. Does this apply to majority of the autonomous colleges?\n\nI'm looking to go for a engineering college through KCET and I'm from a lower middle class family. So I don't want to join a college that's going to increase my expenses unnecessarily.",
