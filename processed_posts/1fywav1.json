      "body": "I did my BCA in Reva university it was very chill there had loads of fun. But here the college is all about studies the whole time, no competitions and not much opportunities for MCA students, placements currently are very bad as mostly engineering students are being selected, also currently there are 360 students in Mca thatâ€™s 6 sections in total so the competition is very high and top of that full day college till 4:45pm and coming to the worst part the exams are super difficult you need to work on it very hard as the questions arenâ€™t straight forward like other colleges and needs a deep understanding of topics. Also the crowd in MCA is terrible barely anyone goes out or does anything"
