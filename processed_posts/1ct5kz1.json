  "title": "The whole truth about the suicide",
  "content": "I pretty sure im the only one who was a witness to the cause of the suicide. I had gone to the office of the COE in the 3rd floor of Mech Block at around 9:35 AM. No other student was there, only the sir was there who always sits at the reception.¬† I asked him my question and he did not know so he told me that he would call one of the teachers. Before he could leave, one boy came into the room and stood just left of me. He first asked which exam was taking place at 10:00 AM and what was the room number for that exam. Then the time was around 9:40 AM. That sir said that no exam is there at that time, the only time for exams is 8:30 AM to 11:30 AM and then 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM. Then he said that in PESU app for him it was showing that the exam was at 9:30 AM. The sir asked him the subject code of the exam, he told it and sir said that the exam for that subject started at 8:30 AM. Then that sir went to call Saritha Maam. She came and he explained the situation to her. She said that it was more than 1 hour since the exam has started so he wont be allowed to write it now. He then said that in PESU app it was showing the time wrong and it was showing at 9:30 AM. She said that he should not have reffered to the PESU app and only looked at the time table. He then said that he was ‚Äúan old student‚Äù and he asked if they could please somehow let him to write the exam. I didn‚Äôt really know what he meant by that. Then for the next 2 to 3 minutes he kept begging and pleading asking them if he could write the exam. He asked if they could go to the exam hall and ask the invigilator, but Saritha Maam said nothing can be done as he was more than an hour late. He asked a couple more times and then dejectedly left. I felt really bad hearing him. Im pretty sure he never even went to the exam hall or had any conversation with the invigilator at all cause he didnt even know which room the exam was happening in. He pretty much only talked to Saritha Maam and the sir who sits at the Office of COE. I personally never liked Saritha Maam and always thought of her as arrogant and rude (I was taught by her during my 2nd Semester), and i definitely felt that she handled this situation wrong as she could have atleast done something to try to help him. After he left I got the answer to my query and left probably a minute or two after he did. The time was around 9:45 AM by then. I  saw from another post that the suicide happened at 10:10 AM. Around 10:30 AM my friend called me and told me that one student had suicided. But that day around 7 PM was when i got to know that it was the guy who was with me in the Office of the COE who had done this. I really felt so horrible about this. I was not sure if I should post this but i dont think this deserves to to be kept in the dark.",

Changing this rule for a single individual, especially when all other classmates and friends have adhered to the timing, raises questions. It is difficult to understand how the timing information could be incorrect for just one student while being clear for everyone else.\n\nI do not intend to suggest that the student was lying, but merely expressing my point of view. When a student arrives more than an hour late, invigilators must follow the rules, which dictate that students are not allowed entry after 30 minutes. They are simply performing their duties. He was over an hour late, making it very difficult and potentially requiring a lot of work to let him take the exam.\n\nThis situation involves a professor in the COE room, who also has to adhere to these rules. COE stands for Controller of Examinations. If so, she is responsible for overseeing the whole examination process. This might not be the first time she has encountered a student arriving late or missing an exam, which could explain her response. According to the student, his PESU app indicated the exam started at 9:30. However, what was he doing till 9:40?"

It is important for you to clearly mention that you have no knowledge of any events or statements that may have occurred outside of the COE room. Therefore, you can only confirm that the statement was not made within the context of the COE room, and cannot comment on any occurrences beyond that setting."
