If u are sure u are getting pes through the KCET counselling u can still participate in the pes counselling and get a seat there and block it just for safey and wait until the KCET counselling finishes ‚Ä¶.then u can get the refund of the blocked seat and join through KCET counselling which will have lower fees.Similar strategy if u have not done well in KCET but have decent mains score."
