It is very good. Regarding comparison you can compare any NIT / IIT all students of their branch (Might be 60 or 100) with top 60 / 100 students of PES.  They have brand / tag, Govt funding, all top students but still some students are unplaced. In PES, you do not get IIT / NIT, but still there is a chance you can get into similar company at the end of the day. Then why company choose PES? There is something. Think twice. There is 8000 students unplaced in IIT, Here PES is proving 500 students to 12+LPA. Why? Why the leadership team of top companies are choosing PES?"

Sure lower nits/iits maybe but the way you said it and with respect to iiitb especially. Id much rather be in a college where top 50% of students get 30+ lpa than where 2% of students get over 30+ lpa. You are just comparing top 30 out of thousand(s) to top 30 out of 120 but thats the whole point, having less students (to an extent) is better due to many aspects. Peer group and exposure also play a role. I get your point that if you are in the top in PES you can get great opportunities and I agree, it doesn't mean its suddenly better than a college where MOST students get those opportunities rather than only the best ones. And im not speaking about lower branches in lower iits etc. Mainly speaking wrt to cse. I would also pick PES cse over lower NITS cse but im from bangalore so might be a little biased towards pes idk."
