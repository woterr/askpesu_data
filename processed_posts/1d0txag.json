There is no point trying to rank colleges beyond the T1 status which IITs/BITS/NIT/IISc have. \n\nSecondly, why are both PES campuses ranked differently? They are objectively the same: placements, degree, etc. Since when did subjective parameters become a differentiator? That's bias.\n\nThirdly, everyone and their mother knows that PES only competes with Stanford and South Korea. We even unveiled our own flag yesterday. PESU League >>> Ivy League. /s"

Further, since the number of students varies greatly across these colleges, unless you look closely, you will only see biased results. This is the same reason a lot of people think RR campus gets better placements when the reality is that RR simply has more people sitting for a T1 company compared to EC. \n\nIf you're going by reputation, then yeah sure I guess your list is okay. Although you should know that from a higher education point of view for MS, everything other than IIT/NIT/BITS/IIIT/IISc gets put into the same bracket, and there is no distinction *between* different different IITs, between different NITs etc."

The comparison is being made after you secure admission through any means.\n\nIf you compare the infra, labs, research, opportunities to build your profile, placements, campus & campus life, and ofc the reputation as well, then in that case, I think Manipal is probably better (maybe not by much) overall. \n\nOfc not to say RVCE is bad or anything: its a great college.
