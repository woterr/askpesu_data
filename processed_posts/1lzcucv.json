If you dont wanna buy it im pretty sure every editions pdf is available somewhere.\n\nFind the curriculum and the respective chapters and try understanding whats going on because the slides for ddco are nothing more than a joke.\n\nYou cannot survive DDCO without a textbook, we all learnt that the hard way after our first ISA."

      "body": "Also, ddco might be a bit overwhelming to start on your own right now, so maybe look into web tech, that subject is easier to do on your own and its also 5 credits and it really screwed all of us over.\n\nBut its easier to self study more than ddco atleast."
