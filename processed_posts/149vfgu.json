      "body": "Nope. Campuses have pooled placements, and they don't even know which campus you're from in reality. Even your degree at the end of the 4 years won't contain the campus mentioned anywhere. \n\nA few people have this misconception that companies prefer RR but that goes down to simple statistics. RR has double, if not more, the number of people than EC. Hence when a company shortlists for interviews, you will automatically see more RR campus kids on the list. Is it because they prefer this campus? Nope - as I said they don't know which campus you're from. There is simply more probability of a kid from RR ending up on the list than from EC. For example - my batch, for CS, had 600 in RR and 300 in EC. RR campus kids had ~ 67% chance of getting shortlisted over EC campus kids with 33%. Hope this clears up your doubts."
