      "body": "I started using a mac in the third year, and had no issues. Many of my friends used macs for all 4 years. No real issues at all.\n\nYou can pretty much run whatever you need - IDEs, Anaconda, Apache (Hadoop, Hive, Kafka, etc), DBs (SQL, Mongo, etc.) of the top of my head without any issues. Sometimes it can be kind of annoying to configure some of these environments, thatâ€™s the only problem I would say.\n\nThe only time I ever noticed an issue was this EDM production workshop we had in our first year. My friends couldnâ€™t setup the FL Studio environment given to us on their macs so they had to watch while the rest of us learnt how to make a basic EDM track lol."

Just make sure to invest in a top model and more memory since you cant really extend it later without causing some damage. If you do plan to get into fields like AR then itâ€™s best to use GPU heavy laptops instead."
