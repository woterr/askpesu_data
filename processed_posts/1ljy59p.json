However, I want to keep my basic strong and want to do some mild courses this summer vacation. Could you suggest what exactly should I do? C programming? Arduino Microprocessor or anything else?",

CS50 is a good course for this.   \nU can also try \"The missing semester\" by MIT, shit like Command line environment, GIT, shell programming are important af.   \nAlso arduino is a microcontroller not a microprocessor."
