If you want lectures to be explained in an elaborated manner, watch Programming With Harry on YouTube or any YouTube playlist of your choice and watch it at 1.5x to save some time. Do some basic coding problems from your CIB and easy level from HackerRank. I think this would be good enough. Focus more on stacks, queues, linked lists and pointers."
