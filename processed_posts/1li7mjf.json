  "content": "Most of my friends have already started going to college and the rest of them have an idea about when exactly their college is gonna start.\nI've been sitting, absolutely bored, at home for the past 3 months now and I'm sure I'm gonna lose my mind if I continue to do so. (Too broke to spend money and go out with my friends)\nThe administration has told that college will start in July, but not given a particular date.\nAnyone who may have an idea about this,\nPLEASE enlighten me🙏\n",
