  "content": "Bro I‚Äôm losing it. Sitting here with a 7.9, grinding Leetcode like a clown, decent at DSA, have solid projects + experience in devsecops/ML‚Ä¶ and then boom not even shortlisted because CGPA filter.\n\nLike what are we supposed to do? For people who were in the 7.7‚Äì8 range, did you still get placed on campus? Or did you just go full off-campus warrior mode? How bad was it really?\n\nI know I‚Äôm not dumb, but this stupid number on a piece of paper is blocking me before I can even try. Anyone been in the same boat? How did you handle it?\n",

You gotta prepare for the interview while practicing dsa.\n\nNo need to be worried just yet. Just grind away and bide your time."
