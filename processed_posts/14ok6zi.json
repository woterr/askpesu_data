  "content": "I recently saw a post asking whether pes is bad and everyone said it's bad. why is it bad? I heard extremely good reviews. haven't heard a single bad review. even the seniors I talked to said its extremely good. I keep hearing it's comparable to many Nits and better than other private colleges like Manipal (ofc in terms of academics. campus wise it stands no chance)",

Other colleges also have placements. And with the very high seat count and both campuses being pooped for placements most people will not get those dream jobs."

I lost two years, and the college gave zero shit for MTech placements. Why have MTech if you don't care? Fucking Doreswamy.   \n\n\nI went to meet Jwahar because I was worried about placement scenario. He said take your CV and roam around Peenya and look for a job. He gave me lecture about initiative and what he would do if he was in my place. Fucking idiot. Not everyone's dads are Doreswamy and has a university as your inheritance."

So you will have way more competition.\n\nThe jobs have not increased at the same rate though.\nIf youâ€™re lucky you will get a very good package. But if you you might have to start with 6-7Lpa and build.\n\nThese stats are all convoluted by the few super high packages."

Many of the really good professors have left, some of the professors are ok and others have no idea what they are teaching. If you are joining pes, be ready for self study as you can't expect good professors. \nAs of now, they have increased the no. of internals from 2 to 5 and there are ton of assignments. So, you won't have time to do anything else except study for exams. \n\nSyllabus wise, you can say that its at par with nits and iits. People generally join pes as no. of companies that come for placements are very high. That's the only plus point here. Of course, if you are getting colleges that are lower in ranking than pes, then joining here would be the best choice."
