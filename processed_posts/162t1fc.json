      "body": "Adding a little clarity to the ISA point:\n\nISAs will now be significantly harder - before, each ISA was based on 1 unit. There were totally 5 units, so 5 ISAs. They have restructured 5 units into 4 units (note the word *restructured*, **not** reduced). Hence, now the content per unit is actually 1.25x what it used to be. Now that there are 2 ISAs, which each ISA testing 2 units, you are basically now attempting *being tested for 50% of the syllabus per ISA*. Secondly, before ISAs had a \"best of 4\" policy where they would pick the best 4/5 ISAs for your scores. That's gone now, so if you don't do well in a single ISA, 25% of your final grade is tanked (each ISA contributes 25% to the overall grade). \n\nAs for the extra curricular activities - I'd say depends a lot on the person. I graduated with the 2-ISA system and I can vouch for and say that the only time we had free time was first year. Once you enter second year, there's just way too many things to get done for each course and beyond the course to actually spend time in sports and other activities."
