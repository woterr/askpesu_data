  "content": "Hey everyone,  \nI have my first ISA exam tomorrow and I’m feeling pretty nervous. I wanted to ask two things:\n\n1. How hard is the ISA exam usually?\n2. If I focus mainly on the PPT concepts, is that enough to prepare, or should I study from other materials too?\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who has taken it before. Any advice would be really helpful!",
