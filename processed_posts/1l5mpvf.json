I heard them ask us to wait 48 hours for an official confirmation- just wanted to know if there was anything else to be done that i might have missed out on. Did any of you receive any information/emails after the counselling?",

My rank is 35xx and I chose cse at ec campus, did see my name come up on screen while there were about 50+ remaining seats but then it got all blurry so I couldn’t see the confirmation. they did call out my rank and told me to wait for the confirmation and stuff but yea there was the blur issue. So now I’m kinda confused a lil bit since I got no other confirmation. So yea do I have to wait it out or contact them about it??"
