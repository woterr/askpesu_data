  "content": "I secured admission through the management quota for CSE, but with a 6.1k rank in PESSAT, I was eligible for CSE (AI&ML) at the Ecity campus. When I called the reception today to inquire about converting my management seat to a PESSAT seat, they mentioned I need to visit the campus to do so. I asked if thereâ€™s a realistic chance of making the switch before I travel from Delhi to Bengaluru, and they said it is possible. Should I go to the main campus, or would it be a waste of my fatherâ€™s money on flight tickets?",

He could've got the same seat thru pessat.\n\nMoral, don't close your options and try everything to save that money. Its a few years of your parents life you're talking about"
