      "body": "If it helps you sleep better, if you get into the top 20% of the batch you get a scholarship. It's every sem, and the scholarship amount is about 40% of your tuition fee. Should offset a good chunk of the amount you pay, provided they haven't changed the way the fees are distributed, what the criteria for the scholarship is and whatnot. For the most part, getting a 9 in every sem sufficed to meet that criteria. \n\nLike someone else said, nobody gives a fuck how you got in. You're all lumped together. What you do and how you make the most of it is up to you from that point on."
