  "content": "I'm sure most of are in atleast one club which is practically dead. There were recruitments for a club in Sem 1 and we were promised that we'd get an intro to the club, how events are held and so and so forth after the seniors were done with their ISAs (this was last semester) and to put it shortly, that never happened. What's the point of going through all the efforts to recruit members by holding interviews if you're not going to do anything about it?\n\nIs there not a group or community that is active? I know some clubs are active but I think recruitments will only start Sem 3? I'm aware some clubs recruit in even sems also so please let me know if there are any active ones.\n\nI'm not necessarily looking for a club? I guess I just want to be part of a tech community with ambitious students. ",
