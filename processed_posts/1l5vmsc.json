Now I am panicking because in one of the posts I saw that seats left for CSE in RR campus in 0. I wanted that only. Is there even the slimmest chance of me getting it in round 2? (95.6+ JM)",

Because before 2024 they used to convert merit seats into management quota (as per this subreddit). And also JEE Main Round 5 results will come on July 10 and PES will conduct Round 2 after 15 July (they're taking JEE ranks till 15 July that's why) so will this affect in falling of cutoff?"
