  "content": "I have zero idea where they're getting it from but all my friends (they're going cse at RR campus) are going on and on about how EC campus is like a school? And RR has \\*college\\* life? They apparently don't let you have any fun in EC campus and in RR no one cares what you do it's all chill?\n\nI looked around this sub there's literally so many posts and comments and I can't find anything remotely saying this.\n\nI think i can get AIML in RR in next round but i seriously can't take that risk that comes with AIML.",
