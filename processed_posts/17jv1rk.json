Companies just see the market conditions, their budget and the tier ranking of the college\n\n3) To get an above median salary (irrespective of college) focus on yourself, upskill for the role you want, network with seniors/other peeps in similar industry and keep getting relevant experience before the placement season starts.\n\nGood Luck <3"
