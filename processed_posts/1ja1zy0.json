Yes there are many papers published every year, yes we do have a few courses like NLP TDL where research paper is mandatory and also everyone has the capstone project, but majority of the work is really bad and there are very few professors who guide well. \nComing to your question, if you really wanna pursue research, most centres have their recruitments in even sem for their respective summer programs. If you want to do it during the semester you could approach any professor with an idea and talk to them about it and try to get them interested."
