  "content": "Don't ask me how, I just made a series of bad decisions. It's all a result of my disinterest in the Branch I am in and stress I've been facing due to some personal reasons. \n\n1.Does a yearback student pay 5 years Fees or only the years he's enrolled in? (Ie 4) \n\n2.Is there anyway around it? , specially given my situation of just one credit.? \n\n3.For example I clear all my backlogs by July. Will they let me consider 4th sem whole as a backlog of 22 credits and let me enter 5th sem of my original batch? ",
