The money was only refunded like 6 months later though.\n\nThey Def suck at correction sometimes, and it might even be on purpose because they love to find new ways to make money. In the paper I gave for re Eval, these fucks had given a direct 0 for an answer that I had bubbled and written perfectly. This has happened to few of my friends too."

Unfortunately there's not much info you get if your grade doesn't increase, and neither can you view it again. I wish there was a way they could show you your paper after the re-evaluation too. \n\nAs for the money, yeah it takes a long time for a refund."
