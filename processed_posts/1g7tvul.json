  "content": "I am in 1st year CSE and week 1 just got over for us.\n1. Engineering physics and mechanical science, these two subjects have gotten me confused.\nI wanna know if it's good to understand the concepts deeply without byhearting anything or will byhearting alone fetch me 9+ cgpa??\nUnderstanding each and every concept properly feels really difficult as we don't have the derivations and just the formulae many times.\n2. Will I need these concepts of engineering physics and mechanical science only for this semester or even in 2nd and 3rd year? (I am a CS student)",
