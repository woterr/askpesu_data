I will put something in your ass so hard it will come out of your mouth and you'll taste your own shit.\n\nDon't trivialise the loss of lives. I know shit happens a lot in IITs and IIMs and all. But that doesn't mean you can justify what's happening at PES with this argument. We are using our brains. We are engineering students. Yes this sort of stuff happens. But the inhumane way the management brushes all these deaths under the carpet. Is scary. No way people will be not worried or scared.\n\nImagine your friend. Or a roommate. He commits suicide due to excess pressure from the college or in some other way the college can't be put blame on directly. The institute will ALWAYS come out and say it's not our fault. I get that, I am not dumb.\nBut think about his parents. His close ones. They'll always. ALWAYS be bitter with the college.\n\nEvery college does this and every college is bad. Doesn't nullify the deeds of PES management or justify them. The frequency with which untoward incidents are occurring, and the alacrity with which the management acts  is alarming to say the least.\n\nAnd if you are an alt for one the management of PES.\nPlease bros. Please, revaluate how you teach things. How evaluate students. What sort of pressure you are putting on them. Also please look into Mech HOD. Please."
