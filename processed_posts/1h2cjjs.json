I understand the need for a cgpa requirement but the teaching at pes is subpar and trash , most courses suck ass and the only way you can get a good grade is by glucking down the slides. Sometimes even the slides and notes are fucking trash and incomplete.\nAtleast VIT has a proper resource system"

It used to be 5 units , now it's 4 and it's all messed up and most profs are crap.\n\nBasically, the effort is you and you only , which you can literally do in any other college. There are some good opportunities that pes gives ofc , but the management seems to fucking all of that over in favour of making more money \n\nThis place massively fell off man , anti club rules , shitty HODs and whatnot"
