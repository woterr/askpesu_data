So a little lower than that in every course will fetch you a 7.75. \n\nFYI an easy way to figure out how much you need to score is to know the average minimum marks needed for a particular GPA. Obviously, if you perform extremely well in one course, it will allow you to get slightly lower on another course. \n\n|SGPA|Required Grade in all Courses|Required Marks for Grade|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|10|S|90+|\n|9|A|80-89|\n|8|B|70-79|\n\nand so on..."
