  "title": "[Question] ECE placements preparations",
  "content": "I‚Äôm in 5th sem ECE, and I‚Äôm more inclined towards preparing only for core ECE companies. I know that very few core companies come for placements, but I still want to focus on them. What I‚Äôm confused about is ‚Äî what exactly do they ask in their pre-placement tests? Like how CS students grind DSA and Leetcode, what are the domains and topics we need to prepare for our OAs? Any guidance would be really helpful because I‚Äôm honestly feeling quite lost and scared about what to study and where to study from.",

Learn about op-amps, and other core concepts, CMOS, VLSI etc., There is little reason to get scared, because core companies will come, its not 0, but just less than CSE based companies thats all."

      "body": "EEE depends very less on department and more on how interested you truly are in electronics. I had done major in eee and minor in cs, kinda helped me out, but its really about how much you are doing extra apart from your course work in my opinion and how truly deep you can delve into electronics, cause that is very vast topic. If you wanna do both in parallel its hard because you wont gain expertise in either and it will be just surface level. You just need a good grip on programming and OS.\nThis is just my opinion, differs for everyone."
