      "body": "Correct me if I am wrong, PESU does not have relative grading, it has an absolute grading system with moderation. Normally 90-100 is considered S grade, 80-90 is A grade and so on. When many people perform poorly in a subject everyone is added some marks which basically pushes their grade by one level. In the previous two semesters there has been moderation in almost every subject leading to gpa inflation ."

      "body": "Yeah, PES doesn't do relative grading. In a sem or two(like in 5th sem for us) you might feel like you got way more marks than you wrote for. That's probably because you did. Idk why or how but sometimes you get a better grade.  But most of the time the grading is not relative and you just get a grade based on your total marks out of 100(ISA+ESA+assignment). 40+ is E or pass and 90+ is S"
