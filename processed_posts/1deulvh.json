You can also take PES AIML RR if you find its location to be more convenient, but both the campuses are basically the same, especially wrt placements. If not interested in ECE, would not recommend MIT ECE."

ECE is gonna be way more harder and you can manage if and only if you're good at engineering mathematics. \n\nAnd if you're looking for CSE go for the core one because you will get to explore a variety of courses in the branch instead of just sticking to ai/ml in \ncse(ai/ml) branch."

My knowledge about this isn't clear but you can definitely have different specialisations through your elective choices. I can forward you a document about the same if you're interested"
