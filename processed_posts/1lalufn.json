There will be almost no concept in the entirety of the three years that will be very \"hard\" to understand. \n\nDon't think of it as 11/12th where you can actually not understand stuff, it's more like 10th. \n\nIn exams you rarely feel \"ahh i don't understand this\", the most common thing you feel is along the lines of \"ahh shit I can't remember the 4 points, i only remember 2\" \n\nIf you want a higher cgpa, the only thing you need to do is spend more time remembering stuff. Formulas, algorithms, or theory. Most of every single subject is pretty trivial to understand. The hard part is remembering them, and caring enough to study. If pes had open book exams, the average cgpa would probably be in this 9.5s\n\nDon't pay for this, just study"

There are a bunch of seniors like Pranav, Advaith, and Siya who are most active in the ISA ESA group and guide us on how to study for free. They even have a GPA above 9.5. No disrespect, but you all should do this for free or just don't who charges money for this"
