      "body": "Just one piece of advice, for any one struggling to decide the courses.\nI have a PhD in management, and while I have realised based on how most of my students today choose their electives.\n1. I want to do something in this domain (usually finance) so I will take this course.\n2. There is a high demand for this in industry (consulting or in this case business management) so I will take this course.\n\nDon't do that.\nWhatever course you take is going to give you an idea of that subject. You wouldn't get any expertise on that subject based on one or two courses. Cause you took say 2-3 electives of management companies wouldn't give your brownie points or prod mgmt role and as someone who sits on student recruitment (admission) you wouldn't get points for your MS/MBA based on your elective too.\n\nElectives are meant for you to learn about a field you can think about more. For instance, if you take an introduction to psychology you would learn about behaviour and if you are doing ML to your degree a big part of modern day Psych is applied to ML to help detect depression, read micro expression, now instead of blindly throwing data (everyone X or Y) at it you'll understand the basic language of psychology if you do so and those X will make sense and you may be able to do a little better than others. \n\nIf you want to study say finance , for some reason most of the GenZ (I'm a 97` born too) things studying finance makes money, a management degree teaches how to build business. No it doesn't. A finance course will teach you the meaning of the words, at best you'll be able to read annual reports partially after a couple of good courses. Management is different from Entrepreneurship. Management teaching administration, not Entrepreneurship. \n\nPersonally speaking, if you like to understand behaviours take a psych course (can refer for an interesting supplement https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL44ABC9278E2EE706&si=8F-LE-n_6qbBJlId) or go for microeconomics (refer https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP62oJSoqb4Rf-vZMGUBe59G-&si=XRC3JSGu_giqh76V)\nPsychology teaching how people/group/organisation work and Economics teaches how markets/money and resources work. Both help you in everyday decisions you don't even think once before taking.\n\nRest choose wisely and enjoy the learning process."

      "body": "Supplement your topics in class with good books and top universities free lectures and you'll be Golden. I scored extremely well for an engineer during finance and strategy cause of this practice than a lot of BCom guys during my MBA courses at IIMX. \nSadly, others are also right about the syllabus and quality is a bit worrisome in PES for management It's okay for engineering also but we produce great engineers anyway, so it could happen for management too, be optimistic and enjoy."

If I pick any of these business management courses and further if I get some certificates ( professional ) on top of these courses then would it help me in getting a call from IIM A/B/C ? 0 workex I wanna attempt CAT in 4th year itself.

But my gpa is down in the gutters and more load on me would just make my gpa worse I think I'll just try some online courses instead so that I can learn new things on my own! Any recommendations would be really helpful! Since I am a cs student and don't really have any experience with other fields of study I really appreciate your guidance!"

And even with a 99.5 you have at best a 20-25% shot at C, and even less for A or B.\nThe criteria are as such, you lose a lot right out of the gate on academic diversity and gender diversity. \nAhmedabad will call the top 100 engineering profiles, that's a tough tough bar to clear. Bangalore gives a good weightage to experience so you'll not get ahead of the crowd there as well. Calcutta is losing its charm so you might face lower competition there.\nRather try for ISB, it's a better school and would get a big scholarship too.\nhttps://www.isb.edu/en/study-isb/post-graduate-programmes/pgpyl.html"
