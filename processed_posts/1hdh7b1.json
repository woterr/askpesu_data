  "content": "As a JEE double dropper with a previous JEE score of 99.2% and a JEE Advanced rank of 5000, my primary aspiration has always been to secure admission to IIIT Hyderabad for their  Computer Science degree However, achieving the necessary percentile (99.94%)  is very hard as I always fall short. ( I hate chemistry)\n\nI can get into IIIT HYDERABAD through ugee exam which is for dual degree  5 year program\n(btech in cse and ms in cse )which will set me back 16 lakhs and it's hectic as hell( I have few friends there)\n\nThe problem is  I have always wanted to do my masters from abroad . It's part of my bucket list.\n\nI have seen many people on LinkedIn who have studied in NIT suratkal, pes are currently doing masters in ivy league college in usa\n\nShould I simply forget about IIIT HYDERABAD and save 16l and do my bachelor's from nits or pes or rv  for much cheaper price and do my master's abroad in ivy league and invest my money there\n\nI reside in Bangalore and pes ec campus is very close by\n\nI am particularly interested in understanding the success rates of students from these colleges in securing admission to top-tier universities abroad, such as Ivy League institutions. I would appreciate insights into the level of academic rigor and the necessary steps involved in achieving this goal, including research experience.",

For MBA, it‚Äôs more about the work experience you have after UG and PESU is quite good for placements. I didn‚Äôt really do any of those previously mentioned things at PES but did other stuff after graduating.\n\nSo all in all, going with PES is not a bad choice. Its definitely a great university and can be a great platform to leverage to go for a prestigious masters in the States"

I'm really excited to join college and i wish you all the very best for your mba program. Could you explain why you made the switch?? From tech to finance. I have seen a lot of my seniors do this and I fail to understand why. Thanks againüíó"

Not sure , check the faqs out anyway they're quite good.\n\n\nEc campus sometimes feels like it's getting the unwanted child treatment.\nYk with rr or the 'main' campus getting something or the other rebuilt.\nInfra at ec is very new and isn't much compared to rr.\n\n\nIon abt the ivy league part , dk where u heard that part from.\nAnyway if u really want to come to pes, try for rr branch."

By that time, I had figured out the things I needed to do to pivot to finance. Once I graduated, I did those things and built up work experience. Finally after 3 years, I applied for MBA programs and here we are"
