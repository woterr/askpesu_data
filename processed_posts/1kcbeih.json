So be ready with this answer almost the whole sem we kept answering.\nThey go with basic Introduction of psychology and subject related intros so nothing that serious about 1 week and after that they'll dive into topic.\nClasses are pretty chill and intresting almost half the chapter they do it by interacting with us so it's basically you gonna have \"Interactive section\" so it doesn't put you into sleep.\n\nIn conclusion it's worth joining pes for psychology initial it will pretty chill but as soon as day passes it gets hectic with so many research papers and case reports just be ready."

Also, I have a lot of free time right now, and I’m not sure how to use it. I’d like to do something related to the course, but I’m not sure what."
