      "body": "Cutoffs are generally high every year , 9.04 was probably lowest in pes history ig . Reason:\n1. Our kcet counselling happened late and was postponed multiple times due to  medical scam last yr , due to this  1st year classes were postponed and pessat seats got vacant coz people opted for other colleges through other exams like cometk etc .\n2. This is just my analysis people can differ\nMajority thought that there would be relative grading in 2nd sem, so people prepared according to it but it eventually got backfired 2nd sem average got less than 1st ,which reduced cgpa."
