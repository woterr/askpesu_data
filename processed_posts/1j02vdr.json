  "content": "y'all i had an idea for a side gig mobile app similar to swiggy/zomato which would let you place orders for food from various stores across RR campus (cantina/13th floor BE block/SKM bakery) and have them delivered to your classroom within 3-5 minutes for a charge of 5-10rs per order, i wanted to know, if this app existed, would you use it?\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1j02vdr)",
