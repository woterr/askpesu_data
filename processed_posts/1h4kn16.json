  "content": "People bragging about their isa marks is okay and stuff but some of them are really too loud and obnoxious as if they really want you to ask them what are their marks and then they act smart saying \"u know it's not that good and all\" but end up having 30+ in all subjects. Even me and my friends have got pretty good scores ranging bw 160-170 but we don't act like it.Just entered the class and saw this whole bunch of girls talking loudly in class, I just put earbuds and started listening songs.Really dislike these personalities sometimes.
