I donâ€™t want that for my brother.\n\nWe want RVCE or PES core cse, how is the grading and competition in both of them? \n\nAnd the placement scenes in both. PES seems to have better facilities but RVCE placements seem good (on paper)\n\n",

The vtu colleges in general have a relaxed grading scheme with simpler tests, it's easier to score cgpa in rv comparatively and many of the teachers told this to us openly in the start, but I have heard rv also has a hectic schedule with a lot of projects that count for your grade."

Some semesters, they hand out grades like candy, and other times, they tank your grades for no reason.\n\nIt gets harder with after first year. If you study consistently with a goal in mind, you'll be okay.\n\n\nNot sure about the cgpa distribution. Someone had posted some stats about it earlier, so you can look for it."
