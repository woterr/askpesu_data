If your in Engineering, this is the best time to do minor courses, if youre in B.Tech, else if you're in other streams you really don't get much if any choice of your minors. When we were in our second semester going to third we got hardly 2 weeks or so I think cause of Covid, not sure about how it is now.\n\nOverall, Holidays here are minimal and you shouldn't expect a lot of them."

Apart from that there's the usual 1-2 days for Diwali and Dussehra. \n\nPES instead saves up holidays for the end of the academic session in summer, where they give more than 2 months off (about 9-10 weeks)."
