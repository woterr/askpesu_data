Too competitive otherwise, because PES' intake is very high. Lots of cheating going on, but college doesn't really care since they want to raise their stats. However, batches after mine(2025) increased their intake massively, so keep that in mind."

CSE cutoff will be different this year as the intake is through JEE and KCET which is a first , but it might be around 96%ile+ for CSE at RR\n\nI'd recommend you joining only if you didn't get a good branch in IITs/NITs/BITS\n\nAnd the crowd is obviously very competitive so you gota try ur best to be ahead to guarantee good results/placements/scholarships"
