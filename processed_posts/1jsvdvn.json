  "content": "So I was minding my own business near the Baskin Robins stall trying to get ice cream through all the crowd.\n\nThat's when I saw this senior girl walk upto this random guy in like this loose white shirt and beige pants(I dunno his name but ik he's in my batch only), and they started chatting.\n\nThe guy was clearly not into it and was shuffling around looking for an excuse to cut off the conversation and leave. I saw him consistently take a step back, only for the girl to close the distance again and again, not getting the hint.\n\nI wanted to interfere, but I still wanted ice cream so I ignored that and focused on the task at hand. I looked back again after a few minutes and saw the guy walk away with his friends and the girl walking back to a larger group of girls.\n\nAnd the ice cream was meh tbh.",
