  "content": "Hello guys, I want to take admission in pes under ece branch by management quota seat so on calling the helpline number they told me that it even requires 80% in pcm in 12th class but I scored 79.9% in pcm in 12th from telangana board. So please tell me whether  I am eligible and is there any other student who scored less than 80% in pcm but still got the management seat.\n\n(On speaking to them they told to come and meet in the office but currently I stay in hyderabad so if I temple from hyderabad to banglore with parents and then if they say no so it will be a loss of both time and money)",

I think even you know the answer. \n\n>On speaking to them they told to come and meet in the office\n\nThen you should do that. Or call them again or try having someone else in the city meet them. You're asking for help with something students cannot help with or have an idea about. Remember that this sub compromises students (and occasional profs lurking), not the admission department."
