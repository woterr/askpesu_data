  "content": "For the guys who are using the library, kindly maintain the library's decorum. The library is not a place for loud talking/having fun. It is not a place to make phone calls. If you need to take a phone, talk softly and do not talk very loudly which disturbs others. If you want to talk in the library, you might as well use the Brain storming rooms available in each floor.   \n\n\nIf you want to have fun, there's enough space around the campus for that. Hope this message is understood.  \n\n\n",

It is minimum sense that a library is meant to be quiet and it shouldnâ€™t be like a park.\n\nAssume they didnâ€™t know that a library is meant to be quiet. Thatâ€™s fine. But despite asking them to calm down and talk softly, they donâ€™t care .\n\nBoss, atleast after someone requests you to talk softer, listen to them. Weâ€™re all grown ups. Letâ€™s not behave like 10 year old kids who canâ€™t understand if someone says it once"
