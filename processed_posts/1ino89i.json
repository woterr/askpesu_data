  "content": "I have taken ECE in ECC. I am in first year. My sgpa was good. If I want, I can get CSE in 2nd year. But I am not sure to do so or not. I think I can do better in CSE but seeing the number of students pursuing CSE is depressing for me. If you think, 14L+ CS graduates came out last year and the number is increasing, how will I end up getting a job after 4 fking years?  If I continue with ECE, I could grind hard and do fine. But ECE in PES is not good in terms of placement. I need a practical advice. Can seniors please guide me? If the answer is ECE, should I change my campus?",

Every career field here is overcrowded and it’s a cattle ground no matter what you choose. the only thing that matters is whether your interests align with ECE or CSE. take a few days, talk to people from both branches and those working in the field, explore the subfields each offers, and do your research. \n\nIf you’re set on ECE, try to transfer to RR next year. The HOD in ECC is a fucking retard, my friends there are miserable."

The next boom will be manufacturing of electronics in india, and semiconductors for the rest of the world. So definitely you can aim big in ECE.."
