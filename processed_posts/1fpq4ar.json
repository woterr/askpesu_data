  "content": "I completed my admission in 23rd but the app hasn't updated anything. It's giving me a timetable for all semesters, I don't have a class assigned to me, and no SRN number. Anyone facing the same issue? Did the first round KCET students and the PESSAT students have the same problem and it fixed itself afterwards?",
