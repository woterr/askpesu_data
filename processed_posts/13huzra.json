  "content": "I passed out 12th this year. I have decided to take bcom. But I'm confused between bcom and acca. I initially planned to take bcom hons but they are saying placements are better for acca as mnc and big 4 prefer acca. Could any of you who are already taking the above courses give your suggestions.\n\nEdit: I heard that there is a student in ec campus who is doing both. If possible can someone please share their contact ðŸ™‚ðŸ˜…",

I'd advise you to go through all the options (cma,cs,cfa,frm etc) and decide based on what you find interest in the most.\n\nDo you plan on doing an MBA in the future? CA won't help you if you do but the other certifications might. \n\nDon't settle down on CA so early or you might regret it"
