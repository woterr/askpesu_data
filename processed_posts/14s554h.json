  "content": "If any seniors could pls let me know as to what exactly the special topics that were offered for their  batch(preferably cse) were  and how was the grading and the length of those.\n\nFurthermore are there any special topics with high demand requiring screening tests or any particular ones you would recommended to take?\n\nAlso how is the cie l1 special topic ? Is it good enough to take instead of other topics and does it help in the future(placements or otherwise)?\n\nThanks in advance.",

I don't really know if it does help with placements but I'm sure it'd be of some help to finish L1."
