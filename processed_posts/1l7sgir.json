  "content": "Students kill themselves over decimals, while real life‚Äîthe one that actually matters‚Äîis happening without a scoreboard.\n\nWe‚Äôve been brainwashed to believe that academic excellence is the golden ticket. ‚ÄúStudy hard, get a good job, live happily ever after.‚Äù But here‚Äôs the twist: **most high-GPA students end up as cogs in a corporate machine**, suffering burnout, chained to mediocrity disguised as ‚Äústability.‚Äù The tragedy? They mistake discipline for meaning.\n\nCompare this with people who **live well**‚Äînot in terms of luxury, but in terms of *presence*. These are the folks who travel, laugh hard, love freely, start messy businesses, fail publicly, and succeed privately. They‚Äôre rich in experience, not in academic accolades.\n\nThen there‚Äôs the **money-driven crowd**, often demonized by the GPA cult. But guess what? Money buys freedom. Money buys time. Money lets you say ‚Äúno‚Äù when it matters. No GPA gives you that. And no, Jeff Bezos didn‚Äôt get there by being a 4.0 nerd. He got there by being ruthless, creative, and obsessed with **building**, not memorizing.\n\nSo, what about **a satisfying life**?\n\nAsk yourself: What is more fulfilling‚Äîacing linear algebra, or holding your newborn child? Getting a 9.8 SGPA, or playing guitar on a beach in Bali? Wasting your twenties in exam halls, or living through chaos, heartbreak, creation, and joy?\n\nHere‚Äôs the controversial truth:\n\n>\n\nColleges reward performance, not wisdom. Society rewards productivity, not authenticity. And you end up with millions of high-achievers who are depressed, directionless, and deeply unsatisfied.\n\nMeanwhile, the school dropout with an Etsy shop and a van might be **happier, freer, and more alive** than any corporate-bound ‚Äúmerit student‚Äù clinging to their LinkedIn profile.\n\n# TL;DR:\n\n* **Good GPA ‚â† Good Life**\n* **Chasing money isn‚Äôt evil‚Äîbeing poor while pretending you‚Äôre ‚Äúdeep‚Äù is**\n* **Life satisfaction comes from freedom, relationships, and purpose‚Äînot numbers**\n\nSo, the next time someone flexes their CGPA, ask them this:  \n**‚ÄúCool, but are you happy?‚Äù**",

But I do agree with one thing that you said, don't stress too much about the exams kids, it's fine if you make mistakes, it's not going to the end of the line if you mess up a question or two. Try your best and see where it takes you. If you still fail at something, you tried your best and you'll have a lot more opportunities growing forward.\n\nGood luck for your exams people!"

If u can't, there's no way you can compete with the WORLD.\n\nDon't take gpa to heart but don't ignore it, a 7.5 gpa isn't going to get you into Princeton, let alone become a Jeff Bezos"
