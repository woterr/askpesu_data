      "body": "Short answer: everything. \n\nLong answer: \n\nYou need a good CGPA to not only be eligible to sit for placements but also to get shortlisted for companies. Companies use various parameters to shortlist applicants - the number of problems solved and CGPA being the two main ones. Depending on the company, they might shortlist candidates with 8+, 8.5+ or even 9+. Regardless, once you get shortlisted, CGPA takes the back seat. \n\nDuring the N interview rounds, it depends entirely on your skills (including DSA) and resume. They might ask you tougher DSA questions and ask for pseudo code, or they might ask you how a certain application might use a certain data structure. Or they might ask you about some framework/tool/CS concept they work with and ask you how it works. They might also ask you to explain your projects and then question you on the project. If the job role is well defined, they will ask you questions directly related to that role and test the skills needed to succeed in that role. \n\nSo basically it's not just a good CGPA that's needed but rather a good combination of everything. If you have only a good CGPA, you will either not clear the test or struggle during interviews because you are nothing beyond those digits. On the other hand if you have a top notch set of skills, excellent projects and experiences but have an average CGPA, you will find it difficult to get shortlisted (this happened to me). So the best solution is to ensure you have atleast an 8.5+ because that makes you eligible for almost all companies and also have all the skills needed to ace interviews."
