While I assure u its not entirely true, you will find a mixed peer group (as in every college). Speaking about myself I got 2.7k in comedk, 98%tile in JEE and left NITK mining, civil & CSE in IIIT Nagpur, Sri City, etc for PES EC CSE (through kcet) and Ik many such people."

      "body": "Others have already posted their views and there are good points. \n\nI just want to highlight that there's no difference between the campuses objectively - placements and profs are same/equivalent. You cannot quantitatively say \"RR is only studies\" since both campuses get to enjoy the benefits of all fests and roughly a similar number of events are organised at both campuses. Yes the scale of the fest depends on the campus but it's honestly not a groundbreaking difference. \n\nRegarding peer group - remember that you're currently judging people based on who scored better at PCM questions, not engineering. Once college begins and you actually enter your branch, you'll often see that the low PESSAT rankers doing significantly better than the so called PESSAT toppers. Your PCM score has nothing to do with how you do as an engineer. EC campus has an extremely strong tech community, even better than RR and some of the best tech kids have graduated from that campus. Also, everyone at PES is very well connected over groups, discord servers, etc. you can always interact with anyone from any campus very easily through these platforms. I was in RR and I've got a bunch of close friends from EC. Everyone has a similar story. \n\nI'd suggest choosing the cheaper alternative here. It doesn't make sense to let go of a CET seat at PES."

Faculty doesn't really matter as 90% ppl study on their own a few weeks before finals using ppts. \n\nIn placements,  there is absolutely no difference.  It's all based on your skill and luck. Companies don't know which campus you are from. \n\nTake the campus which is close to your home of you're a day scholar. Else,  go for EC campus in your case. But as you said,  you have no money constraints. If you really want RR, them go for it"
