  "title": "Fee refund if I get BITS after 5th July??? ",
  "content": "So currently I'm alloted RR cse and there's still 1month left for 2nd bitsat, I didn't do well in 1st attempt because I didn't study much and I'll be grinding this month for 2nd attempt because fees in pes is insanely high and it's similar to bits so I'm thinking of joining even dual at bits. In orientation they mentioned they'll give full refund if we request it before cet results or July 5 and they mentioned if we get iit or nit theyll issue refund even after July 5. So does bits come under this category too cos iteration 3 of bits ends mostly in mid/end of July. Thanks. ",

BITSAT'S second round round was just around the corner but counselling was after these people's refund window closed. I later found out that I could have gotten a dual degree at BITS which I wanted in the first place. I regret that ever since."
