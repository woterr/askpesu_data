You'll find any previous year's paper from [library.pes.edu](https://library.pes.edu).   \nPESU generally doesn't repeat questions but these papers might give you an idea about the pattern. I personally found class notes helpful and even got a good grade by practicing only classwork questions. Hope this helps and good luck!"
