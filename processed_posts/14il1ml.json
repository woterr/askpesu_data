      "body": "There is no *cutoff* CGPA. It depends on the performance of the batch in the first year. Preference is given in order of CGPA - first the highest CGPA, then second, and so on. The batch before you is still in first year, so last year stats aren't available, but shifting to ECE usually needs atleast around 8.7-9. Shifting to CS is even tougher, around 9.7+. Note that this is also possible *if seats are available*. If no seats are available, you cannot switch."
