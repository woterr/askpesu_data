  "content": "Last year , I believe the orientation was conducted on Aug 26 and classes have begun on Aug 28. If this is the case for this year as well, won't the classes be rushed? \n\nInitially it was meant to start on Aug 5. Now based delays of the orientation, it might start on Aug 26..(20 days difference)\n\nWill they not try to complete the portions quickly since they're already running late by 20 days? Won't it be difficult for students to grasp when the syllabus is rushed?  \n",

Since currently 25 is last date for refund/doc submission, they can conduct round 2 pessat and round 1 kcet by July end."

Earlier it was 5, then extended till 15, and now 25. Although seniors have told that they accept docs even after the 1st year has started. There have been no mails regarding this so even I was confused and worried."

      "body": "You must have got an acknowledgement along with the fee receipt, it shows what documents need to be submitted as they are not ticked. Just to be on the safer side though, have all the documents mentioned in the link above with you and yes, sadly, we do need to go and physically submit the docs. Although a lot of seniors did say that they allow to submit after classes have began. So, have a talk with PESU. Frickers are acting here like students outside Bangalore don't exist."
