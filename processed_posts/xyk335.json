      "body": "Just practice leetcode and start giving interviews. You already know how the learning is in private colleges and the chances of getting into a product based company is very low.\nYou will end up wasting most of the time writing assignments, studying for ISA and attending classes.\nMy suggestion would be to study for Gate and apply for IIITB. Even if you don't get IIITB you will learn computer science concepts"
