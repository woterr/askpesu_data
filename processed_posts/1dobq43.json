Machine learning is pretty basic but if you want an edge, you can complete the Andrew Ng course on coursera. although i think you probably know of it, completing that course is a canon event in every ML oriented student's life. For DBMS, you'll have some kind of assignments. We used to have weekly coding assignments and they were pretty good. spend some time on them, i didnt and thats probably why my grade was less than stellar. \n\nYes, you get a two month break at the end of third year.\n\nFrom what we know, placements usually begin by July end. I could give you the same old tips to prepare ( Leetcode, contests, yadda yadda) but I'll let someone more experienced answer that. our placements season starts this july."
