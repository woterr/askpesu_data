  "content": "Alcoding Club was decent to good till last year and great 2 years back... Now these new club heads have made it shit üòï. They don't know what competitive programming is at all, just running behind useless things.... Do this do this.. Can i get sign from here... Blah blah... \nI can't do anything but just hope they again try to make it a coding club instead of just  useless stupid chat club üòê. ",
