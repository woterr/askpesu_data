      "body": "physics in first year deals with quantum mechanics .  now do not make the mistake of assuming that its going to be easy based on whatever quantum mechanics you studied in 11th and 12th physics .\n\nthis is something entirely different .\n\nnow its been quite a while since i studied engineering physics so i dont exactly remember the syllabus and shit but i should say , first unit is easy (intro to quntum mech)  , 2nd unit (schrodingers equations )  is considered tough ( but is actually super easy if you focus in class) , third unit (applications of quantum physics i think)  is irritating but not hard , 4th unit is the easiest (lasers) , 5th unit is the toughest ig ."
