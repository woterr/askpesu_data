(Just in case they have some stupid evaluation criteria)\n\n\nIf it was not for an assignment, do whatever you want. Hackerrank and all other similar websites are primarily for practice and learning. It doesn't matter which account you use as long as you do it."

And we had to solve problems in python lab\n\nSo I wasn't sure if I can use that same account for extra problems at home\n\n>It doesn't matter which account you use as long as you do it.\n\nOkay thanks :)"
