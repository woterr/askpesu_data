It is tougher than cs.\n\n  Secondly, if u are referring to ds campus in harohalli, I recommend u to not prefer that campus. It is so far from Bangalore and it is in ramanagara district. Government buses are not frequent. There are no good pg near the campus and its hostel is very expensive. Some of my acquaintances have visited it."
