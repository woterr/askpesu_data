Apparently the test link was accessable outside the assessment centre , so few ppl who logged out early , went out and still continued the test(crazy that they even remember the test link address).\n\nthey eventually got logged off."

We were all sitting in the 1A and 1B auditoriums, but thanks to the shitty Wi-Fi (or honestly, PES incompetence), the server got overloaded and the test wouldn‚Äôt even load. So Netcore had no choice but to switch to a Google Form with the aptitude MCQs.\n\nThe Netcore staff was walking around to invigilate, but people were being sneaky. I saw this one guy who straight up PRINTED the google form as a PDF, dumped it into GPT, got every single answer in one go, and filled out all 50 questions in like five minutes and walked out."

Despite this, some people wrote it at their homes or hostel rooms and got shortlisted for the interview lol. They couldn't clear it as it was a bit tough, involving system design.\n\nFor blackbuck, the placement officer himself told the recruiters that almost everyone has copied in OA and that no one knows anything. So, those guys were tested on the approach that they used to solve the problem during OA."
