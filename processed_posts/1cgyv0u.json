Very subjective, but I'd say maybe 7.5+ is easy, almost no effort. 8+ is minimum effort.\n\n3. Ideally as high as possible. 9+ is a safe bet. Also If you are yet to do BTech why is this a question now.\n\n4. A tiny bit yes, but not too much either. Primarily its academics + relevant work/research experiences that help. Awards/recognitions are relevant only if they are at a large scale (national or higher)."
