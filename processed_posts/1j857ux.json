What trends are you noticing in the tech job market, particularly for freshers and junior developers?\n\n2. Are there specific companies or sectors actively hiring for backend/ML roles right now?\n\n3. When exploring job opportunities, is it more effective to connect directly with the hiring team or reach out to HR first? Are there situations where one approach works better than the other?\n\n4. What are some effective strategies for negotiating salary with HR? Are there key points or techniques that can improve the chances of securing a better offer?\n\n5. During conversations with HR, what important factors should I keep in mind? Additionally, in situations like layoffs, how can one navigate the discussion to avoid feeling pressured or manipulated to take a low ball offer? \n\n6. As a fresher in Tech(less than 1 Year of Exp) \nwho is laid off, for how long does the gap in resume work (1/3/6 months?)"
