I really want to make the most of this time and learn something valuable, both for personal growth and to help me in the long run.\n\nWhat are some useful or interesting things I can focus on during this one-month break? It could be related to academics, programming, tech, soft skills, or even creative hobbies. I’d love to hear your suggestions!",

I’d love to hear your suggestions!\n\nHey! HSP (PESU-ECC)'s tech club is hosting a project mentorship program this summer called Tilde. If you have a great project in mind you can pool-in and join weekly discord calls and build something cool in public. :)\n\nIf you don't have any ideas, there a couple of projects available if you're willing to put in time, with other team-mates. Here's a link to sign up: https://forms.gle/tywe2q6NRhN7E5J59\n\nPS. Disclaimer: (I'm part of HSP and mentored a project last year called [psh](https://homebrew.hsp-ec.xyz/posts/tilde-3.0-psh))"
