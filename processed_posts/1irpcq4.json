Try to score much better in April session JEE Main like 98.5 to 99++ percentile....try for IITs, I mean it isnt wasy to get top branches....but you will def get a better exposure there.....and if you only fail, omly then come to pes...keeping your goal as pes at first place is smthg...a low key....no hates please...."
