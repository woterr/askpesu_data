      "body": "Every year seats are getting increased so that might be one of the reasons. In some year, the counselling gets delayed, so many people opt out of it, so the cutoff varies a lot. Sometimes even neet counselling finishes before KCET, that's also one of the reasons. All in all there are multiple factors."
