      "body": "Question is what do you mean by manage. If you want to live the \"college life\"* along with studying, then maybe no. It will get \"hectic\" means juggling between ece along with cse. Meaning, you would need to dedicate a part of your life to it aside from what time you give to ece: you must be regular with your core course while also dedicating extra time to cse, i.e, if yoh want to do well in both. And afaik, ece is pretty hard as it is. Don't do this if you just want the cse tag. If you are genuinely interested, you will find more ways that are better without the stamp of having done a college course related to cse.\n\nWhile this might sound a bit demotivating, but there is another side to this. A bunch of guys in cse do a dual degree. The one which iit madras offers for data science. They manage to dedicate time for both college and the degree and manage to have fun with friends as well. \n\nPoint being, you need to be regular. No slack with priorities. If you end up slacking, you might end up in trouble. Also, the iit madras course is self paced. Minor course may not be so. Go for it if you are being honest to yourself (meaning dont choose something on the basis of fleeting emotions). Only then will you able to reap the complete benefits. \n\nTldr; be disciplined or you might fuck it all trying to stand on two boats at once and fall hard in the middle. You will be having less fun than your peers, but if you manage to pull it off, then have better chances later on."
