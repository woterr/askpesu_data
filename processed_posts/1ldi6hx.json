  "content": "just heard that 1st year students wonâ€™t be getting hostel because itâ€™s under renovation ðŸ’€ was this mentioned anywhere before? coz i donâ€™t remember seeing it during admission or counselling. i was expecting hostel in 1st year, but now theyâ€™re just saying it might be available from next year. the worst part is they donâ€™t even have clear info for 2nd year either. like no confirmation, nothing. and pes didnâ€™t even mail or officially inform us about this, i had to call them myself to find out. they keep hyping up placements and discipline and all that, but basic stuff like hostel isnâ€™t even sorted. PGs arenâ€™t the same, and missing out on hostel in first year just feels off",
