  "content": "Hello, I am an EC campus student. On August 13 at 12:15, I went to the library to borrow a DSA book. They told me they couldn't give me the book because I had already taken 3 books. When I checked, 2 of the books had already been returned in April, but they hadn't updated their records. The third book, which I never took, is about Yoga and Meditation.\n\nHere's the main issue: the third book was issued to me on August 13, but that was the first time I had entered the library. Now, it's shown as issued under my name. I explained the situation to them, but it’s been more than a month. I’ve gone to the library more than 10 times, and they still haven’t resolved it. Now, they are asking me to pay a 300 INR fine for the book I never took because they can't find it.\n\nWhat can I do now? Please help me. I am mentally exhausted.\n\n",
