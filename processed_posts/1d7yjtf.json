      "body": "It was the lack of study holidays between subjects ngl. Second and third sem had a good amount of break between subjects which was helpful in revising the syllabus fully and doing previous pyqs. I coud'nt do any previous pyqs this time and my syllabus was also incomplete, you can't revise in a day even with well-written notes. I hope they plan and give at least 2-3 days between subjects from next sem onwards."

Choose absolute grading for easy courses or where the number of people in that course is less, and use relative grading for literally everything else. PES has more than a 1000 students, they gotta make the system fair. They aren't obliged to use only one kind off grading, use a mix of both."
