The Amateur Scientist - national level fest aimed at school kids, gets a footfall of 10k+ every year from across the country. Usually happens August and is organised by 2nd years. Infamous for being the Tinder of PESU. \n\n2. Epsilon - intra college science fest, organised by first years. Happens in March\n\n3. Prakalpa - Inter department (and intra too) project exhibition. Usually held in Feb. \n\nMy batch (2022 outgoing) was the last to have these 3."
