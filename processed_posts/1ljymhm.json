  "content": "So the mods have taken a decision to no longer allow posts that contain invites to groups/communities\n\nReasons  \n1. Being a subreddit, it causes privacy issues for the OP and the people who join, as anyone and everyone can join it  \n2. Reddit is the worst place to share any details even remotely close to your personal accounts\n\nAs an alternative, there's a very very active Discord which can be used for making your groups and communities and stuff\n\nDo let us know if you see any issues in blocking such posts + if you guys find a post with group/community promotion; do flag it. We will take it down ASAP\n\n",

Posting such links here instantly gives the entire internet access to private information, which is very dangerous for not only the person sharing the group link, but also everyone in it. If you want to direct people to WhatsApp, either DM them the link (use your discretion to check if they are a student), or ask them to get the link from the discord server. \n\nReddit is a dark place and there will always be people with poor intentions, and sharing a link to a group with minors can go wrong in a multitude of ways. It's on you to keep yourself safe, and we are trying the best we can to keep you safe too. Hence, the ban. \n\nHope you understand."
