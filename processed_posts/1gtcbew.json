Lol.\n\nDuring college, we were the experimental batch for them, the test group for everything they tried!\nNow, it feels like they donâ€™t even want us to have a proper send-off.\n\nItâ€™s like we went through all the twists and turns of the pandemic, online classes, hybrid learning, and all those last-minute changes... and now weâ€™re just being forgotten!\n\nAnyone else wondering if weâ€™ll even get the chance to walk across that stage? I mean, we deserve it, right? ðŸ˜…\nWe might not have had the smoothest ride, but we sure made it through. âœŠ \n\n#Pesu24Convocation",
