So they have warned that if we don't score properly in ESA this sem, from next sem onwards they will be keeping minimum passing marks for ESA as well. If u don't get those many passing marks in ESA, then u essentially fail the subject regardless of your isa marks. Rn the total passing (ISA + ESA) is 40."
