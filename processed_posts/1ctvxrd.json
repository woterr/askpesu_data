If you're class is over early you either wait or you go by auto or something\n\n3-4 people a room depending on the number of people there.\nLike first they'll fill 3 and then will sequentially add 4th guy if needed\n\nFirst year yes girls hostels are right next to the boys. From second year boys get hostel inside campus. Girls stay there for 4 years\n\nCurfew is like 7.30 the warden will allow you to take food orders till like 8 or 8.30"
