Also don't worry about the hackathons, no one's laptop will ever last a whole hackathon. Get charger that's all. I personally prefer thin laptops but your choice."

The dude who recommended you to go for a lighter laptop is right.\n\nYou won’t be training any models locally. None of us do.\n\nNow, if you want to play games and stuff, sure. But carrying it around will be a pain.\n\nAnd if you have money to burn, I’d recommend getting a Thinkpad and installing Linux with your favorite distro on it"
