But it needs time for you and people to actually know each other properly. You'll also get ample opportunities to socialize. \n\nIt may be awkward at first, just talk to someone first, like they may be nervous to interact with people first.. Who knows that they may actually turn out to be a great friend of yours. And you may also try joining clubs in college, maybe you'll find people with similar interests."

I understand,  learning it might be difficult as even I had difficulty to learn Tamil nd Telugu being a kannadiga. pro tip - try talking to ur kannadiga friends in Kannada, if ur accent is weird, they might find it funny(which is useful), nd they wil rectify u. u might start to  understand the language pretty soon, but talking in it wil take time, but its worth it. most of all, never disrespect anyone's language be it Kannada or Tamil or Telugu , or even Hindi"

If that frnd has a group u can jus join his/her lol.\n\nJoin clubs .. make sure u attend the events as a volunteer from the club and not as a participant. That way u get to socialize much more work purpose at least.\n\nFind that random ass sitting around u in assessment center during exams asking u for help and jus vibe (only if ur the kind who is open to all this copying and shit) .... Personally made some good num of frnds like that lol.\n\nBe nice and u'll get the same back in return fs ... Outliers exists but jus give it a shot. Def worth it"
