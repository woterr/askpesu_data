      "body": "Since both the institutes are autonomous and affiliated to VTU, the basic coursework is similar. MSRIT has a better ranking and brand reputation outside of Karnataka as well whereas BMS is known in the state only. I personally visited both the campuses and found ramaiah >>>>>\nThe placements are better at ramaiah.\nThe campus size of ramaiah is 65 acres, bms is 11 acres. MSRIT has a better NIRF Ranking as well. I'd suggest you to go for ramaiah, but at the end of the day, the choice is yours"
