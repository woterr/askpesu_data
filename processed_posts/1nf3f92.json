      "body": "Context:\n\nBefore classes started for PESU-JEE ane PSEU-KCET students, a set of 4 or 5 people found the whatsapp group for PES Freshers and advertised \"internship opportunities\". They ran an elaborate scam and bagged about 5-6k. Many students started trolling them by pretending to be the legal team of PES, reacting with \"💀,🔥,🗣️\" to the messages sent by those scammers. Now from that WhatsApp group they were also able to collect a bunch of phone numbers which were probably sold to third parties. Along with that, they started messaging the members personally of this scam. We dont know how much money they managed to bag, but its well over 1L easily. \n\nRecently, (yesterday) they started asking people to share this scam in their class groups, and many people did. Many people fell for this scam, and lost about 700-1k per person."
