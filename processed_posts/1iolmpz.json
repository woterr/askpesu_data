With that said, here are the worse ones, from worst to tolerable: \n\nLakshmeesha - ML\nShilpa - DBMS\nShilpa - C\nSurbhi - DDCO\nShantala - DDCO\nShantala - MPCA\nUddoshi - EPD\nNeha - OS\nJenny - Cloud Computing\n\nI also want to talk about the best ones. From best to good: \n\nSandesh - DSA\nAnimesh - Big Data\nGowri - Compiler Design\nLokesh - Electrical\nPrajwala - any subject she takes. DDCO, MPCA, Data Analytics\nKundhavai - Go\nFaisal - Physics\nMath - shivashankari"

She seems genuinely interested in the subject and it makes me look forward to her classes as well :D\n\n\n\nOthers I would add to the best category:  \nSangam Sir - Electronics\n\nRevanasidappa Sir- Chemistry"
