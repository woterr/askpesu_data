The people making predictions are just like you - aspirants looking for colleges. \n\nSo you're basically receiving counseling advice from those who have no idea about the system, haven't gone through this process before, and don't have any facts to make predictions. \n\nDon't be a clown and get out of this blind leading the blind behavior."
