  "content": "Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't it supposed to be atleast 5% of the students should get S grade and less than 5-7% should fail\n\nIsn't this the criteria? Coz last sem(sem4) except LA all the other subjects had around 13-14 marks of grace (ik coz my marks were in the border) \n\nIs it gonna be the same this sem as well?",
