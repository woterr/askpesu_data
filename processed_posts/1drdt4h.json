  "content": "I've been seeing juniors on this subreddit ask for advice regarding PES and many people commenting \"omg there's no college life\" , \"no it sucks\".\n\nDon't pay attention to these random people who probably expect to go to college to party all day ( Manipal is the place for u then 🤣🙏). If you're a smart , decent , academic student who's willing to study and yes enjoy ( RR campus is beautiful , i don't know when u haters graduated and why you are shitting on it but constructions almost over now and shit is fire) ( the gym and sports facilities are amazing too ) , then PES is the best place for you ( also its in Bangalore and you'll understand why that's advantageous during your 4 years ) \n\nThe only negative feedback would be that it's expensive , but it's not their fault that u didnt do well in KCET and are relying on management/PESSAT.\n\nAlso suicides happen everywhere. There's dumb people who aren't mentally strong enough to cope with stuff and end up killing themself stupidly without thinking about their family members and other things everywhere , so you cant go around saying 'if i join pes ill suicide oh no!' \n\nPosting anonymously so rowlet and whoever else that stalks reddit 24/7 doesen't spam me 🙏\n\nAnother thing to mention is , every senior always shits on their own college. I know IIT Kanpur'ians who say that they wished they were in IIT-B and RVCE students say that management/campus/academics suck and etc etc . So don't trust everything they say here and make ur decision independently.\n\n  \nAlso the hate on AIML is completely false  ( u/rowlet-owl ) 😂 , AIML will perform very well and already has a lot of scope , imagine 4 years from now. Placements of most colleges in AIML have been better than CSE, and if u check the syllabus of PES , there's nothing wrong with it. The only con would be that it's a hard subject which again depends on the student. Placements for undergrads in CSE(AIML) will be exactly same if not better than CSE students. The only problem would be for Masters   , which is also not as big of a problem as they make it seem and doesen't affect everyone.",

Btech Degree can be used to build a foundation; and luckily you have enough online resources to specialise during/after college degree. So yes, AI ML is relevant af (my company is also building for it) but, fundamentals is key\n\nAnd coming to Rowlet; you absolutely have no idea how much he has done in college and the knowledge he has; and if he's suggesting something, think of it as a good senior's advice. He's an amazing guy who has helped too many juniors by giving unbiased and amazing advice. As a senior, what he's saying is just advice, it's on you to take it or not! \n\nAnyways good luck on your degree and remember, build fundamentals and a strong foundation"

Placements of most colleges in AIML have been better than CSE,\n\n>Placements for undergrads in CSE(AIML) will be exactly same if not better than CSE students. \n\nHalf knowledge at best. \n\nAs someone who literally has been in this field for almost 4-5 years now AND knows how recruitment for these roles work, trust me when I say I know what I am talking about. The roles you see which brand themselves as \"ML Engineers\" - they aren't ML roles. You will not be doing any ML work. These are glorified Cloud Engineers or DevOps (nowadays called MLOps) roles. And what work do they do? They simply work with existing models and ship them to customers for their use. And what skills do they need? Holy shit what a surprise they need to know topics like OS, cloud, networking and so on which (again wait for it) are core CS fundamentals. You will be using zero knowledge of ML for these roles, that's why you will be seeing CSE grads and SWEs primarily working in these positions. I've spoken to engineers at multiple companies - most, if not all, engineers in these roles don't really know what ML topics they are working with and neither is it required.\n\nSo now your question might be, \"wait, whats a proper ML job?\" - these are researcher/scientist roles (often called Applied Scientist) which are reserved for applicants with *at least* a Masters degree AND years of research experience. Just make a quick google search and you will find that even the most entry level role in this field requires at least a couple of years of experience which means that these aren't roles for undergrads. There are about a handful of roles at most which do recruit undergrads, but getting into them is close to impossible. These are pure research driven roles in which you pursue research like an academic setting. \n\nUnless you are someone who wants to get into research, you have the same career prospects as someone in core CSE. Also, the drawbacks of AIML were never in its placements because it was always known that people would jobs from the former category.\n\n> and if u check the syllabus of PES , there's nothing wrong with it. The only con would be that it's a hard subject which again depends on the student. \n\nLMAO. PES is merging core courses together. Its teaching courses like Big Data which are often correlated with concepts in OS and networks without teaching them first. And nobody knows which courses get the same treatment in 3rd year. Meanwhile, students in CS not only get to cover all the CS fundamentals but they get to cover the *same* ML courses as electives. People opting into a mathematical field without even knowing that they are is the biggest con. It wouldn't have been an issue if PES *added* AIML coursework to CS coursework, and not replaced bits and pieces to make a mishmash of whats there.\n\n>The only problem would be for Masters , which is also not as big of a problem as they make it seem and doesen't affect everyone.\n\nReally want to see how kids from AIML cover courses like Adv. computer architecture or compilers or other core CS coursework in MSCS programs without covering the base courses in undergrad. And this is if they consider you for admission. As the prestige of the program you are applying to increases, so does how keenly they look into what coursework you have covered. If US Unis already consider courses like compiler design in PES to be inadequate for undergrad level, you think courses which are a mishmash of multiple ones do any better?\n\nOf course, you are free to assume that I have no clue what I am talking about and that I pull shit out of my ass."

Forget that, you are probably too new to even know that PESU profs from multiple branches have been going through AIML training since 2021-ish so they can \"adapt\" to teach AIML. If these are the same profs teaching you these courses then you have my condolences.\n\nThere are about a handful of profs who were specialised enough to teach the course. There were more before, but most have left. Most of the others are jack of all trades."
