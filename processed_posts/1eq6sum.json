  "content": "My Machine Learning teacher walked up to us,a group of 6-7 kids sitting in the last three benches and said\n\n“All of you look the same like Chinese , go to gym,try to have curly hair,have glasses and eat that same dirty protein powder”\n\nCompletely unprovoked might I add,just randomly walked to the back of class and said this during a break.\n\nShe’s a pretty awful teacher and she says all sorts of random shit during class and she switches off the recording device when she spews her nonsense…She flings chalk across the room,she throws markers on the floor when they don’t work and if you ever ask her to go to the restroom she’ll say “you also go out,I’ll also go out but for that you have to pay me more than 1 lakh per month”\n\nPretty much everyone in class hates her,is there anything I can do about it??",
