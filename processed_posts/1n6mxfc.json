      "body": "Through JEE: Anything above 92% is usually sufficient to secure a CS (AIML) seat in the Ecity campus. The better your percentile, the higher your chances of getting into the top branches.\n\nThrough KCET: The cutoff for ECE at Ecity was around 6.1k (GM category). So, a rank better than that improves your chances of getting CSE, ECE, and other top branches in both campuses.\n\n(I had a 3k rank in KCET which was enough to join ECE in the RR campus but since I live much closer to the Ecity campus and preferred CSE, I took admission in the latter)"
