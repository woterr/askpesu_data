Screw 'action' being taken or anything, at what point will the college take cognizance of the fact that they need to pay more attention to their students? \n\nThere is literally no elected student council. There is no student organisation whatsoever to liaise with the management. There are no resources to seek help. The designated counsellor in college breaks confidentiality when spoken to and reports it to the management. There are no mental health awareness programs conducted. There are no workshops conducted to sensitise the professors. The management makes it a ritual to have a speech every year to call every new batch 'terrible'.\n\nThis does not sound like an institution that is blameless. This does not sound like a healthy environment. And this most certainly does NOT sound like the Pride of PESU or whatever. It hurts. And I don't know how to help fix it.",

      "body": "Hi guys, I am writing this in word doc instead of a WhatsApp msg, because its lengthy, and I want only the interested one read this. This is for students who are currently in college, and to anyone who is interested to read. I recently finished my Brach, my college days where memorable I had good friends, I had good teachers too, in my college I had few encounters with the College Management, I was part of many events, and I was actively involving myself with lot of leadership building tasks, I had situations where the college tried to frame students for their mistakes, when I tried to solve the issue only then I was able to see the system of education and universities with a better goggles. If I am a student in a college and I find injustice, inhuman behavior by staff, imposing non-logical rules on students from the management, can I do anything about it, can I raise my voice and not be targeted, I ask myself, are we just students who have toÂ  obey what is been told, be quit towards everything that we canâ€™t tolerate, are we just losers in students who are passing from the professorâ€™s mercy?Â  As a citizen of our country what can we do to future students, will it be the same situation for the future students.Â  In India mainly there are two type of colleges or universities, autonomous and nonautonomous. An autonomous college that has been granted autonomy by the University Grants Commission (UGC) or the respective state government. The aided (non-autonomous) colleges are affiliated to any one of the state-governed Universities. Imagine a situation where the college as implemented a rough rule and few students have an issue with it, what can they do so that college will listen to them and consider their request. Letâ€™s consider a good situation where the college is filled with good people and react to the students request honestly, then the students can request the college and get their problem solved. What it the college is filled with bad people? Firstly, I think no amount of complaints or request would force any college to take a decision which is not favoring them, or worst any saddest human is in charge of the college and decide not to change the decision to satisfy ego. What can a single student can do about it? Is it required to have a student body directly engaged with the College authorizing authority, for example UGC or govt University Committees? What can be powerful enough for the colleges to listen students and not ignore? Itâ€™s difficult to find a person or authority to whom colleges should be answering, even if the govt brings such facilities there will be lot of issues in execution. For example, imagine there is a section or person appointed to listen to students, itâ€™s easy for colleges to buy him, and be in good terms because students change in 4 or 5 years but not university owners. Even though there are many criteria mentioned by the authorityâ€™s for colleges, to have a clubs or council in studentsâ€™ extra activities to involve them in student politics. Many colleges ignore or destabilizes such interest in students, if they find it difficult to deal with it, I will list as many as possible techniques by colleges I have heard and seen. Colleges try to keep is as secret that in order to have a good score for being a better college in India or state ranking, or any type of ranking system for colleges, they need to have committees for students to help them and resolve their grievance. Few colleges smartly fake it, when it comes toÂ records, they choose some favorite students who is either loyal or dumb to sign documents as testimony, which says they were part of many clubs and did many things which they didnâ€™t do. Next one highly smart work of teachers who will find students who are hungry for more marks and appreciation to be the leaders and make them their puppets so when if there is a situation where the students are trying to go against the college favor, they can use the puppets to calm them down. Usually they make the elections to interested students who wants to be in charge of any group or council to have an interview selection as a criterion and pick their favorite there. Imagine there is situation and students are angry about college and thinking of a protest, they keep exams and internals to keep the students busy so that they wont have time to think of doing anything, or give tougher questions to make the students think that they are not concentrating on studies, which gives an opening for teachers to insult and keep them low.Â  There will be lot of spy teachers who keep track of all the things in the class and college, they will be friendly with students who are talkative and who likes to share all secrets they know easily. Most of them are good teachers, I am warning about the exclusive bad ones.Â  When you know few things you get angry, Donâ€™t be short tempered and fight with anyone whom you find guilty, things you should be sacred of as a student, your Internals, exams, your degree certificate, your original Certificates which is taken in the time of admission, good behavior report for masters and visa, donâ€™t be a fool who falls inside tiger cage. So, let us work on our question, what a single student can do?Â  Educate yourself with all the knowledge about how the colleges are running, be united. If you have any kind of groups or event groups stay connected with as many other block students. If there are any type of elections or anything make sure the elections are democratic, of course you cannot stand alone against the teachers, but you can try to convince your fellow students and to make sure none of your friends are becoming a puppet in their hands.Â  Imagine a situation you have to raise your voice against something in your college do you have any ways to inform every other student in your college, but if there is a committee of leaders from all the blocks who are responsible enough to inform to their respective fellow block students its possible, and now itâ€™s not â€˜a student voice itâ€™s the students voice.â€™ Now you have a united student voice, ok whom to talk with? firstly find the humblest way you can to request the college, most of the colleges have good people in charge. Sometimes itâ€™s the teachers who smartly blame the management sometimes vice versa, in few situations the approach towards the govt university committes will help in case of autonomous I think its UGC but I have no knowledge on how to complain.Â  If itâ€™s only bad guys all around try finding someone who is above the bad guys. Itâ€™s the tough part, which I cant suggest as a guide to anyone with a format but I can give tips on finding your own ways.Â  Know as many past events and actions taken in your college which gives a hint towards the path, read about incidents around the country, try finding student unions and seek help. Personally, I donâ€™t have any experience dealing with such issues. I believe it would take a lot of courage and leadership qualities for students to make any changes they want to. Everything you do in college years effects the juniors, if you know things share them, have a constructive support among students and make sure you can pass the knowledge and experienceÂ Find leaders in your juniors and support them. Thank you for reading, have a great day.Â Â "

All they did was go about organising events for their clubs and occasionally co-operate for larger shared events like fests. But there wasn't anything related to student welfare or representation. And club heads as you know aren't based on elections, so there isn't any democracy here. \n\nAre you referring to the same thing, or is there a new concept of an elected student body?"
