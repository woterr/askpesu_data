If you want to know my reasons, they have been discussed in detail already in the FAQs on this sub. Your comment just shows how misinformed you are about how the industry works."

My opinions are nothing but neutral and my own, after observing things around me. I've praised PES where it deserves credit and also been harshly critical where needed. \n\nI've spent time in the industry, including being in the hiring process, as well as with grad school admissions. I might not know everything, but I do know a fair share about how things work in the real world, which you are yet to see. Your sample size is limited to what you hear from your friends, my sample size is based on how the industry and the world works - big difference. \n\nYou're free to have your own opinions shaped by what you know, but discrediting mine does not get you anywhere."
