If you arenâ€™t doing an internship I would definitely suggest to do atleast one summer course. See I guess you can do 2 but 3 will be a stretch cause idk if Pes will have those many courses stretched out. Generally, itâ€™s like there are different options, but all of it happens during the same Two weeks.but definitely go for summer course cause you didnâ€™t do special topic also try removing burden from next year youâ€™ll get busy with capstone also next summer"
