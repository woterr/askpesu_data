  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nToday, I attended the Pre-Placement Talk of Goldman Sachs, and they mentioned that they are hiring for the SDE (Software Development Engineer) role for the upcoming Summer Internship. I’ve also noticed that several other companies are offering similar SDE roles.\n\nThis has left me wondering —\nDo companies only expect software development skills from CS students?\n\nWhat if someone is more interested in Data Science, Data Analytics, or other non-SDE roles? Do these companies even consider such profiles seriously during on-campus placements?\n\nDo Tier 1 and Tier 2 companies ever hire for Data Analyst, Data Scientist, or related roles directly through campus placements?\n\nI'm genuinely confused about whether I should continue building skills in data related field or shift focus toward SDE preparation just because that’s what most companies seem to be offering.\n\nIt would be really helpful if some seniors could share their experiences or guide us on how to navigate this situation.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Some of them also have web dev requirements. \n\nThat doesn't mean companies dont come for data science roles. I believe meesho had come for 50+ LPA data scientist role. \nLook at JDs attached with the emails u receive.\nYou will get a good idea of what role the company is looking for."

      "body": "You should read the FAQs, I answered this previously in an older comment. But to summarise - companies will hire under a generic SWE/SDE role and then assign teams based on fit later. Sometimes you get lucky if your profile shows an alignment with what they are looking for (condition to vacancies in hiring teams). But mostly, companies do \\*not\\* directly look for specialised roles because quite simply, they do not expect such specialisations. \n\nFor more details, look up my older comment."
