  "content": "Hello, I'm a very passionate and skilled programmer who's worked on related high-end projects for a while now.\nI'm planning to join RR Campus for BCA this year. At first glance: the infrastructure, the facilities(basketball court, badminton court, gym, etc) seemed pretty cool. There seems to be a decent amount of hangout spots within the campus aswell.. the food court is pretty huge.\nBut, I'm not sure what the staff is like.. the teachers.. the timings.. and so on. I would like to know more information about this.\nI've heard about how hectic the CSE life is in there, I doubt it'll be that hectic for BCA..? Would surely love to hear about it from you guys directly.\nI'm also really interested in the campus life (hackathons, clubs, and fests) But I'm unsure about if all of this is there.\nPlacements dont seem to bother me right now, I have my own plans.\n\nWould really love to hear from you guys asap.",

      "body": "if you have the choice of joining universities like Christ ( ie they have a name ) for bca, id suggest you take that up.\n\nmost of the professors and staff are okay but the department doesnt bother much about bca students. They're more focused on mca and mca placements. bca students are treated like an afterthought for everything. their first priority is always mca.\n\nas for hackathons and stuff, you'll definitely have in department as well as campus wide opportunities but considering bca is relatively new in the uni ( yours would be the third batch ) we aren't really thought of / considered outside of our own department. you'll have to make opportunities for yourself. \n\nthe syllabus is also constantly changing. dont go by what they show on their website because besides semester 1 theyve not stuck to any of it. what my batch has is completely different from what our juniors have.\n\ntimings are standard uni timings. full days are 8-4 during odd semesters and 8:45-4:45 during even semesters ( same as the dept of engineering ). usually full days are only 2x a week.\n\ni cant say anything about placements because my batch will be the first to sit through them in the coming semester. things aren't looking really good for us because they were struggling with mca placements the last two years and when we asked about ours they gave us very vague answers. faculty advisors will urge you to continue with mca in the department rather than look at placements ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

If they're asking for it I can work on improving it tomorrow"
