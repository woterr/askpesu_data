  "content": "For the new students through JEE Quota , the form wasn't visible on the website so people said go in PESU app and click \"Student Grievance\" to gain access to the form.. which I did .. but thanks to the excellent app it didn't let me upload my passport photo itself .. so I had to submit form without it. Now they said my application is incomplete because of no photo, and I can't access the form back by same method. Is anybody going through the same here and have found a solution to it ? ",
