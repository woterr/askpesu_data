      "body": "Do not choose ECE just because you didn't get CS , take ECE only if you have interest in it . ECE is prolly one of the toughest branches and without interest you are gonna suffer . If you are truly interested in programming try going for CSE in EC campus or take AIML in EC campus . There's not much difference in RR and EC campus , RR has a slightly better campus that's it imo.\nView other posts on this sub regarding RR vs EC campus to get to know more"

      "body": "AIML was just introduced last year and since all first years have common syllabus no one really knows how the course is structured. AIML will have all core CS subjects for sure which have been taught for many years . Choosing AIML will restrict you to one domain and you may not get to choose electives from other domains like cybersecurity, systems etc in your third year."
