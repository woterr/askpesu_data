If all you want is validation, you shouldn't have asked a question. \n\nHere's the harsh truth - your GPA is low. It barely meets the eligibility criteria to sit for placements. You're not really in an advantageous position here. Most companies will filter you out at some stage or the other. If you aren't filtered out to write the test, they'll filter you while shortlisting for interviews. And about the examples you quote - they're exceptions, a handful among the hundreds with a low CGPA who are struggling to land a single offer. \n\nThe question is, are you in that exception, or are you in that handful? Only you can answer that. Not saying you don't have a shot - but you're going to have a very uphill struggle. There's no point living in your daydream that you're going to have it all easy. The sooner you wake up and realise that instead of countering facts, the better for you. Good luck."

This is the only real answer.üôè\nBeing at almost the same cgpa range as OP , it takes so much effort to get a decent internship as compared to someone with 8+ gpa, you would just get filtered out even if you feel you are better in other aspects.\nThe placements are still going on (2025 batch) and i still see people less than 7 gpa unplaced. NOT saying all the people who have less than 7 gpa are unplaced.Most of them come under 7."
