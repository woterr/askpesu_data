  "content": "I scrolled through the subreddit and some people said curfew is from 10pm and rules arenâ€™t that strict but some people said curfew is from 7pm and youâ€™ll have to follow the rules, Any senior can clear these doubts? \nWhatâ€™s the curfew time?\nTill What time we can order food and everything?\nAnd no way you canâ€™t even go to your friendâ€™s room after 7pm \n 24 hours prior notice for going anywhere is that thing legit?",
