      "body": "There is a longer version of this in one of my older comments, but TLDR - \n\nFirst year is the lightest in terms of workload, course load, and other commitments, which makes it arguably one of the easiest to do well in too. You should aim for as high as possible (9+) because your first year's GPA forms the foundation on which the GPA of your future semesters will rest. If you screw up too early, you're going to have to play catch up in tougher, busier, higher semesters. But if you score well, it gives you a lot of room and cushion to fall back on when the semesters get harder to do well in. Most people who regret having a low GPA regret most about not making the most of their first year and/or taking it too lightly, because by the time you realise that you need to pull your socks up, it either too late, or you need to put in an ungodly amount of work to lift it even by 0.25 GPA."
