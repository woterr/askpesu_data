So if you're in first year there's a lot of time for that, lot of things might change\n\nBut if you're interested, they range from cybersecurity topics, systems, and ones in ML. Since there are many courses and if you're interested, you can ask anyone for the latest course information on the discord server. It has the listed electives."
