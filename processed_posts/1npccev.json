  "content": "Today in the morning I come to college and see that there are like 4 news channels reporting outside college, I asked them they refused to reply\n\nI ignore and walk in for the DSA exam, asked CS people what type of questions they had exam, most reply with code completion type etc, so that's what I study and Guess what no coding question in 4 markers, I was devastated, everything was fricking drawing \n\n** Also why was News people outside? **",
