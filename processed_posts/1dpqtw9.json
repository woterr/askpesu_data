We have not spoken to the faculties involved. Do not get scared with Phy cycle faculties. There is a hell lot of difference between the profiles of first year faculties and the rest. \n\nTry to take information from serious seniors and not the ones who had fun in the subjects. Many seniors told that misguided by their seniors they took wrong subjects and later regretted as they were outdated and the grades made no meaning."

You still need to know core subjects pretty well which you could if you paid attention in class. Also teachers do matter alot in your courses if they teach well you will obviously have an edge over others.\n\nI don't study I daily I study on random days alot of hours together. Although I should prob change that now since I'm going to second yea."
