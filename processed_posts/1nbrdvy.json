  "content": "Ques 1) I have the PES account but I did not initiated the payment process because I was told that the registration process was over. If I do this now do I have a chance.\n\nQues 2) Is there a possibility that it's too late and many students who have registered might have already switched to other colleges and I may have a chance for getting that seat?\n\nPlease answer both the queries.",
