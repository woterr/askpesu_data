Unlike the other colleges you mentioned, both campuses at PES are indeed equivalent, if not the same, with pooled placements and other opportunities. Sure, there used to be differences way back, but since ECC gained autonomy in 2018, they are now objectively the same.\n\nChoosing RR over EC campus in 2025 just because it (was) called \"main\" campus does not make sense. Choose the closer one if you get the same branch at both campuses."
