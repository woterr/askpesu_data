      "body": "Short answer: you won’t get shortlisted.\n\nLong answer:When you’re in 3rd year it’s super hard to get shortlisted because the only reliable metric companies have is your CGPA.Usually for the first round they have a cutoff of about 8 or in some rare cases 7.5.\n\nI’m assuming you’re talking about summer internships,don’t sweat it I’d say maybe 10% of the batch get summer internships through college and it’s quite rough.I was in the same boat and I managed to make it to the second round of one of the companies only because I had a referral and that was the only time I had a chance.\n\nThe only thing you CAN do is get a referral and hope it makes a difference but there’s a solid chance you won’t get into the shortlist at all and even if you do and manage to score out of out in the test there will always be someone with a higher GPA which ruins your chances,the luck factor is only if you can compete with maybe like an 8.5.\n\nI’m not trying to put you down,I’ve been in the same shoes,don’t sweat not having a summer internship it doesn’t really matter as much.Id say work on your gpa and get it up to hopefully an 8,keep working on your DSA and your interests and try next year during placement season."
