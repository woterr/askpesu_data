So I don't see the point of taking ece just for the sake of getting into the main campus."

My idea was to get ECE at least since I would essentially get the same placement opportunities as the CSE students and study a similar course as they are. Please let me know if I am wrong though."

      "body": "You can switch to RR CSE only if your CGPA is above 9.5 in the first year, and this is again only possible if people give up seats. Add these factors together and you will realise that there is a very small chance of this happening. On the other hand, you can switch to CS at EC campus with an 8.5-9. Don't choose ECE just because its the RR campus, its a brain dead move. Branch over campus always, especially because your campus matters for 3 years at most but your branch will affect you in the longer run.\n\nAnd you should only pick ECE if you are interested in it. If you are interested in CS, pick the one closest to CS (in this case, AIML), such that you get to study the course most related to your interests even if you cannot switch branches."

ECE peeps can answer the same technical questions with a little prep, but that's only useful at the interview round where it's ignored. For all placement exams, especially if its a core software job, the shortlist will be almost always CSE only. \n\nDo not take ECE if you are dead set on a software engineer role."
