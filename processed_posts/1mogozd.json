      "body": "Prepare for the \"SDE\" role, most of the companies come for SDE positions only. Few come for data science and AI/ML but the expectations are just too high for a final year student. SDE includes large scale real time projects, cloud hands-on experience, backend technologies, kafka or some type of load balancing, docker, jenkins, kubernetes, basically technologies that are actually used in the industry. So prepare accordingly"
