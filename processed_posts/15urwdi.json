  "content": "I will be joining pes rr cs and I'm going to stay in the boys hostel. \nFor a little context, I got 98.9 in jee mains (disappointing for me), 20k in adv (I blanked on paper 1 and couldn't recover enough marks after), 264 bitsat(but didn't get any cs 4yr course) and 449 kcet.\n\nI've decided to take up the iitm course and that will start almost simultaneously with pes sometime in September. I've done some research and since it's an iit degree, it is supposed to be tough, even if it is manageable, it will probably require time.\n\nHow much free time does pes give you per day(except during exam time)?\n\nAnd does pes give a generous number of holidays?",

Although yes, you definitely can take out time to pursue other things but you should be warned that PES does tend to have a lot on its plate when it comes to assignments and projects. \n\nAs for holidays - no, PES isn't generous with holidays during the academic session. Instead, the entire chunk of holidays is saved for the summer, where you get 2.5 months of vacation. Apart from that you get a few random days off here and there during the course of the academic year."
