  "content": "Hi,a fresher here and wanna know what would be a perfect total score out of 100 in the ISAs in order to get a decent CGPA of 8 and above\nWill an average of 13-15 do the work,I suppose it wouldn't work for a good grade\nAny chances that the ESA scores would pull the score and ultimately the cgpa as the weight age of ESA is 60%\n\nSeniors please help",
