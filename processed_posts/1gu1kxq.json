  "content": "So my exam was at 12 and they let everyone in to the mech building at  ≈12:00 and i dont have a track of time after that but it took me a while after that to reach my exam room. They just gave us the answer booklet and sent us to our desk, and we hade to fill in details while the time was running out, by the time i started solving the time was already down to 50mins.   \nIs it always like this? Do u not get time before exam starts to fill in the details on the answer sheet?",
