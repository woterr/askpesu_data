      "body": "Firstly, the branch itself is a much better option. Core CS is better than a specialised branch like AIML. Check the post from the FAQs: [https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/14c1iym/faqs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/14c1iym/faqs/)\n\nSecondly, better placements (although not by much). PES has a much better placement record, one of the best in the state. \n\nThirdly, more academic rigour pushes you to do better. The crowd is amazing and top notch at PES with alumni at great places today. \n\nThe only major con is that PES is very strict and hectic, your college life will never be close to what you might get at BMS."
