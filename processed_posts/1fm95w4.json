Whenever they respond back, there's always something in their response that you frame as a question and ask.\n\nHonestly faking confidence until you get some is a pretty nifty way lol, try it out.\n\nIf you have some interest, join a club, you'll have people with similar interests.\n\nI feel like a baba now, but try to grow, the uncomfortable shit you do now makes your life better later."

Slowly you will feel more comfortable with them. \n Basically \nYou need to seem APPROACHABLE \nIf people feel like you won't respond to them they won't talk to you. \nSince you don't like talking, be a good LISTENER. Trust me a lot of people like those who can listen to their endless rants about life. \nI hope it helps. I know it's hard unless it happens naturally. \nAlso yeah I agree : working on your self whether it is going to thr gym or learning a sport can boost your confidence and you will feel like your worthy of having friends."

Share what you are going through with him/her (**mentor should be able guide you**)  \n2) **Meditate everyday** (if possible in the morning)  \n3) Start penning your thoughts in a personal diary (just let your feelings come out on the paper) - **This can be a game changer for introverts**.  \n4) Try to help others - doesn't matter how small it is (lending a pen, donating few bucks to poor kids, visiting an orphanage and donating old clothes or food, just do it. **When you help someone, it boosts your self-confidence - this is tried and tested infinite times.**"
