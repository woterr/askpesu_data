  "content": "I‚Äôm in my 4th sem right now and college feels so depressing every day. I used to be fairly decent in studies, but now my marks are low, the teachers are really bad, and the whole environment feels tiring and sad. I don‚Äôt feel like studying or doing anything remotely productive anymore. \n\n\n\nWhat makes it worse is seeing people around me who are so smart and seem to have a lot of shit figured out. It makes me feel scared and worried about my future.\n\nI‚Äôm worried for 3rd year, especially with internship pressure. I don't know how i'd be able to handle it. How do you deal with it?",

I felt the same way during my second year at PESU too as so many of my classmates found summer internships at great companies and research opportunities on campus. \n\nI never really cared as much till then, and was just an average student, but at that point it made me start to feel bad.\n\nAll I can say is stop caring/comparing yourself to others and start working towards your own goals. You still have some time till the proper placement season. Keep slowly, silently and steadily grinding I would say. Most people overhype their readiness, preparation and skills, so don‚Äôt bother. Focus on your own GPA, capstone, leetcode, technicals, whatever.\n\nI never found a proper second year internship either. Most of us didn‚Äôt. Some of us (like myself) found some random unpaid thing, where we did no meaningful work. Still when the time came, I managed to get an internship, that I later converted to full time. All my friends did the same. So there‚Äôs success waiting down the line for everyone.\n\nAlmost 4 years out of PESU, I can say that it all worked out for pretty much all of us. I don‚Äôt think anyone that I know is doing badly at this point. Sure people are at different places and phases, but everyone still is doing good.\n\nlol this is a sappy af answer, but I felt the same when I was in your shoes. Now on the other side, I think ‚Äúwhy did I worry so much‚Äù"

That being said your own effort to understand the subject, work on projects, debug issues, learn a software. It‚Äôs no more a school.. everyday is a hurdle, just do what you love to do/ want to do, at the same time giving enough time to clear subjects without any backlogs, that‚Äôs the only way to get through college"
