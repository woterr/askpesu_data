      "body": "I'm in the same boat as you, but my parents prefer MIT-B because it isn't as academic-oriented as PES is. Mit-B is gonna be a big-big gamble, but if what they say is true about centralised placements, I don't really see a big problem, but again, it's a big risk. If you're willing to take the risk and see how it gets played out in 4 years, choose MIT-B."
