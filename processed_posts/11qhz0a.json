I thought pessat had negative marking tho it doesn't have.\nI read somewhere if you get above 100 in pessat your CSE is secured in RR campus"

And for Ec campus cse cutoff went till 3.2k. I heard this year they might again increase the seats due to opening of Golden jubilee block. So the cutoffs will go even more higher(rank wise)."
