For instance they introduced a course called AI in Architecture for us.\nThe classrooms are great, they've got laser lab, a 3d printing machine and other stuff like clay modeling lab and stuff. You could utilize those for your projects.\nI personally liked the Faculty as well, although I do wish some of the good ones didn't quit. We saw a great number of good faculty resigning, but hoping that doesn't happen to the rest of the good ones.\nI found the projects to better than the ones VTU students receive too. In 3rd sem, we were designing a Primary Health Care centre, whereas the project for 3rd sem in VTU colleges was a tiny salon."
