      "body": "Let's first clear the common misconception: No club will help you directly in your placement journey. Adding clubs to your resume adds exactly 0 value. Having said that, clubs are effectively a way to take time off from academics, work on your interests and build some skills, which indirectly may or may not contribute to your placement journey. Also, joining a club isn't any kind of \"official\" or formal \"contract\". \n\nIf you're looking to improve your communication skills, take part in events like debates and MUNs which are organised by the respective clubs. There are also other similar events. You'll have to pick based on what you like or what you want to do.\n\nAlso if you think you don't have time in first year, you're going to have even lesser time as the years progress."

It can surely help with placements sometimes."

      "body": "Let me rephrase, in case you glossed over my original comment: just being in the club and writing it on your resume has 0 value. However, being in a club gives you opportunities to work on yourself, which can in turn help you during placements. I believe it's the latter that helped you (not simply writing down the names of 5 clubs on your resume), since it helped you build the skills needed for the role."
