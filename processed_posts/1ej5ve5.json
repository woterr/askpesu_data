If you score well, you will be able to fall back on a high GPA. So pay attention in class, make notes, read the textbook and give it your best. \n\nAlso, explore whatever PES has to offer from events to fests and make new friends and find your interests."

PES alumni network is great so if you can make friends with good seniors, they'll happily guide you when it comes to various things. Seniors here have always been very forthcoming and helpful - many alumni like me also take out time to help current students from time to time. They're all on discord. \n\nAs for professors, network with the right ones. This subreddit has a lot of poor feedback but many profs are still good and networking with the right people can open up opportunities."
