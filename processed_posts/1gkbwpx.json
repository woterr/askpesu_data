I have a feeling that as PES keeps increasing the fees, the quality of this sub gets decreasing. \n\nTo answer your question, score more gpa. there are many sapiosexuals in PES, once you start scoring 9+ cgpa and start getting MRD scholarship - girls are going to flock towards you. \n\nGo study now kid."
