  "content": "The RR campus happens to be much closer to me location wise, however aiml seems like a compromise as compared to core cse; the cutoffs for cs ec campus are quite literally double my rank, which is also discouraging. Should I rather go for msrit ise instead of both? Could someone help me out?",
