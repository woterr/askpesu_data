A typical phishing link looks like something familiar with their (/PESUNI) - I’m an alumni and I haven’t seen anything like that on our software infrastructure. \n\n2. The email looks legit with PESU banners, but that’s not hard to forge. \n\n3. I searched on [scam detector](https://www.scam-detector.com/validator/klr-bz-review/) https://www.scam-detector.com/validator/klr-bz-review/ and it seems to be legit but it is an energy company domain. They likely have no business with PESU and don’t seem to even be a third party software provider for file uploads. \n\nPlease don’t click this link and report it to the ISFCR and other such proper authorities. \n\nAlso, if you click the small little arrow next to - to me below the sender’s title, you’ll be able to see who is exactly this email came from. \n\nYou’re right to question why they’re asking for copies when they have the original and that’s exactly what’s necessary to detect scams"
