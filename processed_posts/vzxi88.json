Since you already paid during the first round you don't need to pay during the second round. \n\nThis was the procedure 4 years ago, might have changed so maybe ask someone from the more recent batches."

      "body": "yes yes afaik, since first sem is common for all branches they dont change ur section if u change branch within the same campus. But if u change campuses, then theyâ€™ll change sections and u will be attending the new campus after second round"

      "body": "Great to hear that. Hopefully they'll explain all this in the counselling there. Btw can I get CSE in EC campus or ECE in RR campus with rank of 177X in second round. I mean are there any chances since the scenario regarding counselling of other competitive exams like kcet is same like last year (PESSAT's first round before kcet's first round counselling) . Second round of PESSAT will be after kcet's first round counselling most probably."
