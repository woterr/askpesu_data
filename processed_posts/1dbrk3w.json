      "body": "Firstly, a bit of information: **No college will actively help/spoonfeed you**. Whether you are in an IIT or at PES, it **is up to you to make use of the opportunities at hand**. Given this, a better ranked college such as any of the T1 colleges will also provide way more opportunities than a lower ranked college to build your profile. These opportunities can come in the form of research and work experiences. But its not impossible for a T3 grad to have the same experiences, just more difficult to gain access to them. Thats why a good UG college reputation is at best a \"good to have\" rather than a \"must have\".\n\nAs for what opportunities PES offers for MS admissions, I recently added a detailed comment regarding the same a few days ago [on this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/1dav416/comment/l7n6f99/). This should cover all your questions. \n\nIt is impossible for any of us to say whether the opportunities at VIT are better, although it definitely isn't easier given the massive batch size at VIT. But this is for you to find out from the VIT sub and seniors. You should also reach out to seniors from these colleges currently pursuing or have pursued MS on LinkedIn and get their opinions."
