Note that there is no soft copy of the actual degree available until you yourself scan the hard copy, instead you can get something called a \"provisional degree certificate\", explained below:\n\n>when they give a soft copy of proof that we completed our degree\n\nYou can submit a request for a provisional degree certificate (PDC) the moment all your grades for all 160 credits of your degree are available and the department considers you as being eligible for the degree. This means after evaluation of all special topics and internship grades of 8th sem as well, which usually happens by end of May.\n\n>do people usually show their final transcript with all the credits n grad date\n\nFinal transcript with graduation date is only available at the time of convocation too. However you can generate a provisional transcript as well. The timeline follows the same as the PDC - needs to be done after all evaluations are completed, usually by May."

      "body": "You can apply for PDC once they release the forms for it, usually it's a few days after the day results release. And once you apply, it takes another few days for them to generate it. The PDC is a hard copy - you'll be expected to visit college and pick it up."
