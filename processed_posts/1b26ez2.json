  "title": "Demanding atleast 1 day of study holiday between the subjects to study during ISA",
  "content": "Atleast just 1 fucking day of study holiday is required between the subjects during ISA. Because we will get more time to study and cover everything for the exam. How the fuck are we even supposed to finish 2 units for the next exam right after the previous exam!? After one exam, just ffs one more day of study holiday is required before the next exam. Why TF would they make it continuous? In which there is no days of gaps to study between the exams for different subjects during ISA!? THIS IS FUCKING IMPOSSIBLE!! JUST ONE FUCKING DAY!! ONE FUCKING STUDY HOLIDAY!!! JUST ONE!!!!!!! That would make it better in some way. I don't give a fuck if everyone disagrees, but I'd say that it will make it a bit better. Probably there could be at least few people that would agree that we need one day of study holiday during ISA.\n\n\nSo let us all, during the FAM while giving signature, write that one day of study holidays is required during ISA. I AM SERIOUSLY BEGGING ALL OF YOU TO DO THIS!! PLEASE FFS MAN!😭😭😭 At least we will be able to cover everything which is there for ISA. It is not possible for everyone to cover it in one day. We all are different.",

There is some breathing space also and it's not so stressful. If we plan our time well the 3 isa system seems better..we have time to do the assignments too.  earlier with 5 isa system there was no time to do assignments properly and I felt tremendous stress. In the 5 isa system, before the an isa was over already timetable for next isa was out and it would give me too much anxiety.\n\nWith the 3 isa and 75% attendance it's a lot better I feel. But the college timings have created stress."
