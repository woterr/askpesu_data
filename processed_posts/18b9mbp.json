Image Processing and Computer Vision\n4. NLP\n5. Digital Twin and xtended reality\n\nE4:\n1. Heterogeneous Parallelism\n2. Topics in Deep Learning\n3. Database Technologies\n4. Meta Learning for Graph Abstraction\n5. Information Security \n\nSo I also want to know if database technologies is a good course even for those who've taken Big Data for E2..how much more do we get to learn.",

Because like MI doesn't seem soo nice because of the number of algorithms stuffed into one unit. \n Also MI faculty...very few of them really knew the math.

Capstone you can manage, you don’t have to do it the whole sem, they expect some output by the end of 6th sem not the whole project\n\nTry getting a summer internship, helps if the company you intern at handout PPOs later. Some do, some don’t but if you get an opportunity in a company that gives out ppos to summer interns, you’re kinda sorted in 7th sem as well"
