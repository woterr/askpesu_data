You can always make the money back, you should prioritise your interest first.\n\nThat being said, EEE is known to be much harder and if you're someone who doesn't like the course in general then you'll struggle with it. There are far lesser opportunities, and even if you do end up doing a CS minor, companies still do prefer a CS degree over an EEE + Minor in CS degree (I answered this in detail in a previous post, you can check it out). \n\nIf you want to have better opportunities (and also pursue your interest which seems to be CS) then you should stick to what you have. CS placements are really good, you can make the money back soon (if that is your concern)."
