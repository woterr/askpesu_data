I've seen folks from EC campus getting placed before many people in main campus (doesn't say much but gives you an idea that it is a fair game)\n2. Idk never heard of that\n3. Oh yeah it is competitive. You fighting with 1000+ students.\n4. Imo PES EC CSE"

That also depends on availability of seats in RR. \n\nOn the same note, you can change branches as well. But to do so, you not only need high cgpa but that also depends on if seats are available in the branch."

      "body": "There isn't any catch. EC campus kids sometimes complain that more RR kids get selected compared to EC and hence \"companies show bias\", but this is not the case because (1) companies do not know which campus you are from and placements occur in the same place and (2) the sheer number of kids in RR is way more than EC (almost double), hence more kids tend to get placed from RR than EC, thus causing this so called \"bias\".\n\n3. The number is close to 2000, since most companies which come recruiting for mainly CS kids also allow ECE and sometimes EEE to sit for tests. Some even allow Mech. The competition is at least 1500-2000 generally for any of these companies."

      "body": "EC Campus student here, youre missing out on nothing from PES RR other than clubs, activities, opportunities to work with people, good infrastructure (although crowded the buildings are hella sick, EC is getting there with the new building but still). \n\nrest are the same, the faculty used to be better in RR, but now both are shit lol.\n\nIf you can get 9.5+ in the first year AND hopefully there are some seats left in RR, then sure go for it. \n\nPlacements are absolutely same, no difference as far as I have seen. No catch whatsoever, which means that your competition will definitely increase because youre competing with folks at RR as well. \n\nany AI/ML courses, Im personally against them, and this is coming from a person who is quite into AI/ML. Personally, I would suggest juniors to do a general pure CS degree atleast. This gives you a vantage point of if youre really into ML or not, cuz alot of people just fall into the hype. \n\nTheres many core courses you need in terms of working professionally in the industry so id definitely say PES EC CSE. This not only allows you to enjoy the other core computer science subjects but also choose electives like Deep Learning, Data Science etc, through out."

Intake is the same since last 2 years."
