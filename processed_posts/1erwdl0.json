  "content": "This question is for the seniors who were in the EC campus hostel, did you guys also face a problem with your jio sim not working in the hostel and tried to use the campus Wi-Fi but anytime your laptop went to sleep or you changed location in the campus the Wi-Fi got disconnected and you easily ran out of the limited login limit, how did you help this?\n\nIn my room I have an Alexa echo and use my laptopâ€™s hotspot as a router but that is kind of a problem to keep the laptop running for long duration also I canâ€™t use most of the sites(even Instagram does not workðŸ˜­), canâ€™t play any games, basically I can barely use internet.\n\nTried using a vpn but that also did not work.\n\nIf anyone has similar problems or a work around you used please tell.",
