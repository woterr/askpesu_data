  "content": "1. I am aware that both the campuses are equivalent but what is the possibility of decentralization of placements for EC and rr campuses? (I've heard it's being considered for some rv colleges so I thought I'd ask)\n\n2. While I know the academics are rigorous are they so bad that we don't have time for stuff like using the gym or just playing general games for maybe  two or three hours a day?\n\n3. How are hostel roommates assigned?\n\n4. Is the metro line near the college(EC) open yet?(I do not live in Banglore so no idea how to check)",

      "body": "1. Not happening - placements have been pooled since they were centralised. They went through a lot of hassles and permissions to gain autonomy and centralise it, they won't revert it. Plus the colleges you mentioned (RV, etc) aren't comparable. RVU/RVCE are different, both do not come under the university status, unlike PES, where both come under the same autonomy and guidelines.\n\n2. You can take out 2-3 hours per day. Academics are rigorous, so you need to put in efforts at least 1-2 weeks before the exams. People come in with expectations of studying overnight and passing. That does not work here.\n\n3. Someone else can answer.\n\n4. Not yet. Nobody knows when, it was promised 2 years ago."
