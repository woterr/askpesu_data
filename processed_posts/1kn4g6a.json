I'm probably gonna try for masters in US (alr did for UG and gonna try again) so im not sure which would suit me better.\n\nI've heard a lot of downsides in both universities especially regarding infra, proffesors and the college life.   \nYou could argue about them here as well.

Although for certain universities like Stanford or Brown you'd need to have an interview after passing through the initial application. (Some students directly get in that's because their stats must be really good).Â \n\n\nRVCE might be good because it probably is easier to score than PES. Although I've heard about all the other cons like getting little to no holidays and stuff like that. The only reason I'm choosing PES at EC is so that I could go back home everyday rather than staying in hostel. (RVCE is 1hr 15 mins away)"

Only PhD requires an interview process, and *all* unis need an interview for their PhD applications.\n\nAnd speaking of popularity - being from RVCE or PES does not have any significant benefits since they are treated the same. Unless you are from IIT/NIT/BITS/IISc, you aren't going to be treated differently. And once you do end up there, nobody cares where you came from."
