  "content": "Our classes ( B Tech 1st year) are going to start next week and for now, they've mixed up all the branches and arranged them into different sections based on alphabetical order, will we continue to be in the same section next sem/next year also or will they reshuffle after KCET students arrive? Also, will the new sections for next sem be alloted combining all branches or will it be same branch students in the same class? ",

In third sem all peeps in ur section will be from ur branch and sections would again be alloted srn wise (like 1-60 in A section) . The people who come in later rounds of counseling will be alloted different sections in 1st sem but from 2nd sem onwards it would be purely according to srn which doesn't depend on when u joined in 1st sem."
