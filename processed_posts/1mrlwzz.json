  "title": "[Placements] Cooked Situation for 26 Batch?",
  "content": "No decent companies have come for placements after the first week (after Meesho, Zomato, Couchbase, Flipkart). Compared to the 2025 batch seniors, where more than 20 companies had visited by this time, it feels pretty disappointing.\n\nThe only good companies in terms of brand or pay seem to be LAM (who usually hire just 1 CS student) and StockX (which only looks at 9.5+ CGPA). The rest are either mid-tier startups like Titan Email or MNCs like Dover, which arenâ€™t really ideal for CS students.\n\nWhen are companies like Okta, Juniper, Palo Alto, IBM, Oracle, or Amazon expected to comeâ€”if theyâ€™re even coming? The issue is, if we apply to some random startup now and end up getting an offer, weâ€™re stuck because of the restrictive placement policy. That means we wonâ€™t even get the chance to apply if better companies come later.\n\nUnlike seniors, who were at least told which companies were coming in a given month, we havenâ€™t been given any information. We didnâ€™t even have a proper placement orientation.\n\nIt honestly makes you question the point of maintaining a 9.2+ CGPA and building strong skills when so much of this process feels luck-basedâ€”like whether you get an easy or tough DSA problem compared to your peers. On top of that, companies are now exploiting freshers by expecting them to know everything, including LLD, right from the start.",

Only startups are coming and their recruitment procedure is very random and non-standard compared to bigger companies..\n\nAlso Okta and IBM won't be coming for our batch from what I know. Juniper is acquired by HPE now so mnostly they won't come separately to hire. Actually f\\*cking cooked scenes"

It's not exactly too great, but it isn't down the drain yet either.\n\nI was rather annoyed by how Netcore Cloud went about the whole shortlisting + interview process. That entire day was a waste of time, with people freely being able to cheat and still get shortlisted."

Oracle also recently did layoffs, so take that as you will.  Amazon never came to PES for a traditional SDE role, but rather a Cloud Support Associate Role, but it was also in September-October and not now. Palo Alto never conducted their OA. \n\nWe were never told which companies are coming every month, it was just during August-September along with the orientation. \n\nAlso, what's wrong with Dover? The pay seems okay and you're working in their software division anyway, a lot of students would like to work there. \n\nWhat a lot of people did was get placed in a reputed enough tier 2 FTE, like Deloitte which came around August- September and then got better placements as more companies came."

The amount of cheating, the sheer greed of people who are placed during this season will drain you out physically and mentally. You'll see the true colours of a lot of people who seem to be \"good\" people. \n\nAlso. something similar happened for major companies such as Apple, where many people wrote their tests from home and had a much easier second round(a friend of mine got asked some pretty basic linked list related questions). \n\nFor your own good, please don't be too hung up on one company, because it will just hurt you."

They are asking them to do virtual interviews (may be due to lack of the infra), but as per their company policy they can't give virtual screening rounds and it has to be in campus. These are high paying stable companies. Unfortunately the students are going to loose these precious opportunities in this tough job market situation."
