      "body": "This comparison is baseless. The people who complain about ECE being too hard and a pain are people who picked the branch just to get into PES and be eligible for IT companies during placements, while actually being interested in CS. If you compare the demographics, *atleast* 80% of the people in ECE come from this category and thus bias the entire opinion. \n\nYou need to show interest in whichever branch you choose. Unless you are interested in a branch, everything will be difficult for you. Interest goes a long way in making this more likeable and easy to grasp. I personally know people in ECE, EEE and Mech who love the field and have taken it up just out of passion, and I have never heard them complain even once about how difficult or tiring it is. At the same time if you pick up any of these people and place them in the so called \"easiest branch\" aka CS, I can guarantee you that they will all complain about it being difficult. \n\nYou cannot compare subjective parameters across branches. It's your interest in the subject that will determine how easy it becomes for you."
