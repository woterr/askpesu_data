But my rank in cet is enough for some specialisations(like ise) and not cse so I'm sticking with pes through pessat. Don't take ise when you have the option of cse in a similar college, ise is seen as a subset of cse."

However, going to multiple fests and club events in other colleges, I would say PES has much better quality...."

Pes is simply an extension of your school. For me college shouldn't be just studies but of an exploration of oneself!"

      "body": "Not sure about the current placements at BMS, but a few (2-3) years ago PES had much better offers coming it's way. Assuming things are still the same, then PES should have better placements with higher median packages being offered. \n\nHowever as a college, BMSCE is better rounded and won't be as academically focused at PES. You'll get more free time to explore your interests and work on other things, unlike here where after 1st year you'll be grinding non stop week after week because of the absurd number of tests, assignments etc you'll have to finish per week. \n\nI'd suggest you to do a little research on the placements at BMS for the '22 and '21 batch and notice the trend. If you see that the median packages are comparable or a little lesser, then pick BMS."

Also, will AI/ML students be allowed to sit with Cse and Ise for placements??"
