But I highly suggest you consider choosing electives you're interested in, rather than selecting random electives just for the GPA boost."

When it comes to CNS,  the concepts are quite easy to understand but there are coding parts which can be a little difficult to understand but it's not bad overall. Also, CNS ISA questions will all be MCQs."

      "body": "Cryptography is a very easy subject IMO, it's just solving puzzles and it's also very interesting. CNS on the other hand requires a decent understanding of CN and uses many concepts that you learn in it. But CNS is also interesting in its own way as you get to learn about computer viruses, learn how attacks work and simulate attacks during CNS lab sessions. Either way, CN is a core subject and you'll need to understand the subject for placements so don't worry if you didn't do well before. If it sounds interesting to you, take it."
