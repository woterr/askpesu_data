  "content": "*I don't mean to harm anyone's feelings but I'm genuinely curious because this will be my first time living away from my family in a new city.*\n\nHi all! I'll be joining pes rr this year as a cse with aiml student. Although I'm thrilled to be here, I'm also kind of scared of everything that's going on in Bengaluru right now (as shown in news and other reddit posts). Is there really some sort of discrimination against people from north? Will there be something like this in the college campus by professors and other students if I can't speak kannada? \n\n",
