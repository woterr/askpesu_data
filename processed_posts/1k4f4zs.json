One month internship wont be worth much but finding what field your into early is better.  \n  \nCertifications from coursera, udemy dont mean much if you dont code along or build something of your own from whatever thing your learning.\n\nSo,Find out what you like(Web dev / App dev / ML / Statistics / low level coding) and work on it."
