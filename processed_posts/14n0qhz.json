If there aren't too many differences, you should pick IS. \n\nOpportunities, clubs, research, facilities, and faculty at RV are far better than what is at PES today. PES only has an updated syllabus which does not make a great difference since it is barely enough to make a dent. Placements if I remember are equally good at both colleges."
