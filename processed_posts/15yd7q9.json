A good college is just a gateway to a lot of opportunities. So, here, in my case, not only in core, I'm also interested in IT. So considering all the above factors, i'm planning for management. I unfortunately couldn't make it through PESSAT, seat surrender being the lowest this year. So, if there are any seat surrenders in latter days, I should be good to go."
