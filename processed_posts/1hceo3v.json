  "content": "My class co-ordinator randomly announced that the minimum attendance to sit for the esa has been raised to 85% and that mail has been sent to the parents of students with attendance below 80. I might be cooked cus even if I attend all my classes, one of my subjects will just be below 85. Are they bluffing to make us attend the rest of the classes or are they serious?",
