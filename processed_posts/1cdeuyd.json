How will you know which score resulted in which rank? \n\nPESSAT is completely computer based, there are no previous year question papers, and only your rank is provided to you. Since it takes place over multiple dates, your score is normalised and then a rank is assigned, but there is no way to determine how much you scored or what is needed for a particular rank. And with negative marking this year onwards, don't listen to people who say \"I went in without prep and got CS\" or \"I marked everything randomly and got CS\". Things will be significantly different this year."
