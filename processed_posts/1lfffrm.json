As with all things related to the COE, it is significantly faster to handle issues/requests in person. Many people in my batch who were posted in different cities had their friends in Bangalore collect the PDC on their behalf, scan it, and send a copy within the same day, so they could share it with their employer and then post it to them over the next few days. \n\nIf you are in the city - go pay them a visit and sort it out. Else, send a proxy. Either way, unless you make a visit they will not speed things along."
