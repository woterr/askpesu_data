Honestly rvce is pretty hard to get, msrit and bms are also tougher to get (though bms has increased seats), so pes through jee mains is the best option for anyone who stands no chance of the above three (only if u can afford it though, financial muscle probably plays a big role in deciding if it's the \"best\" option for you)"

On the other hand, RVITM CSE is in a completely new campus – there's barely any college life, it feels more like a school. Placements there are average to decent, with the lowest being 3 LPA and the highest going up to 27 LPA, but again, it’s a very new campus.**\n\n**Considering both placements and college life, SIT Tumkur is definitely the better choice. Just go for it, bro!**"

Having a CGPA of 8.5+ is the best bet if you're in CS (although don't let that stop you from aiming for higher).\n\nYour projects, experiences, publications and other work that makes up your profile is what will matter. Once you clear the CGPA cutoffs to sit for companies, your skills and projects are the primary factors that will land you a job. It's a similar story for Masters, although you preferably also want a much higher CGPA since it's weighted more.\n\nSummary, don't spend all your time on your CGPA. Find a balance between the CGPA you want (an 8.7-9.2 for CS is the best possible thing you can achieve without sacrificing too much on either end) and your other activities. Good luck!\n\nStudents with cgpa above 6.5 are allowed to sit for companies,rest the companies decide the cutoff,A cgpa above 8 will allow you to sit for 99% of companies. And many companies shortlist higher gpa students in the process.\n\nA company offers the same package to all students that it selects, irrespective of their GPA.\n\ni guess it helps u"
