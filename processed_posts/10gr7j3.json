Just try getting approximately 80% in all exam components and a full in the assignment/project.\n\nIf you want a breakdown assuming you get a full score in everything else(lmao) here it is:\n\nSo getting a 9 SGPA means you need atleast an A in every course. Getting an A in a course means 80+ out of 100 in your final score.\n\nLet's say you get a full in ESA. Since it carries 50% weightage, that means you've already gotten a 50. \n\nNow your combined ISA+assignment/project score contributes to the other 50. Back in my time, this assignment/project component was on an average 10 marks. So you need 20 marks from all ISAs.\n\nIf you get 10/20 per ISA, then your best 4 score will be 40/80, scaled down will give you that 20 you need. \n\nSo if you get 10/20 per ISA for all of them, AND get a full in assignment/project AND get a perfect 100/100 in the ESA, will you get an A grade.\n\nSee how it doesn't make sense to do this calculation? xD"
