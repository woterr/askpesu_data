  "content": "I thought PES was a good university till I read this subreddit. I am really shocked reading so many negative reviews. Should I even consider joining it? I scored 92.43 percentile in jee jan attempt. I scored worse in april attempt due to health issues. I belong to general category so I am not sure if I will qualify for advance. I am writing comedk,viteee,aeee,ugee,bitsat along with pessat. Are vit and amrita better than PES? I heard that vit is a scam and the college life is terrible so I am not hopeful about that too. Atp I feel like I don't have much options. Is the high fees worth it? Will I get a good placement in PES if I take CSE? Or should I take a drop and try jee,ugee and bitsat again next year? I am so lost. Any guidance would be appreciated.",

Maybe only the bad things are getting more highlighted here. \nI have studied at PESIT long ago. I know quite a lot of students who have studied there over the years. Almost all of us have overwhelmingly good opinion about the quality of education there and the placement opportunities. \nMy personal recommendation would be to join PES, if you have an opportunity. \nAlso, do talk to students currently studying there, the alumni, etc (and not just rely on reddit here)."

      "body": "So here's my opinion: don't finalise PES (or any college) until all your entrances are done. Focus on what's left and give your best and then decide. \n\nPES isn't worth it through PESSAT anymore. There are similar/better colleges which cost about the same. PES is good but it isn't anywhere close to the reputation it has outside. Only once you enter do you actually see the college for what it is. However, every college has its share of problems. The major advantages of PES are it's placements and syllabus, everything else is pretty average at best. So if you're looking to just get a job at the end of your degree and nothing else, this place will fulfill your requirements. \n\nTo summarise, PES isn't bad by any means but it definitely isn't the \"gates of heaven\" that some people think it is lmao. But it's definitely better than Amrita or VIT IMO.\n\nI've documented the rest of the pros and cons of PES in the FAQs: https://bit.ly/pesu-faq."
