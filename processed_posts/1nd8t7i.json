  "content": "IBM was my last fucking hope, i dont want to attend any more tests anymore cuz every fucking company has their entire process flawed. the entire industry is flawed ffs. this was my last piece of bread, i wanted it so badly. now all my college mates who i have been around since day 1 of college have been placed and are chilling so hard. i envy them and hate them. i dont want anything so badly as being placed anymore. the ultimate goal to attend such a 'prestigious' college with all its star decked army of professors and research labs, paying lakhs each and every year has been to get placed and support my family. now i have lost my best chance of doing that. idk what to do anymore.  \nNo logic nothing in the shortlist, i already gave up on placements. The shortlist makes no sense. Not one deserving person in the list. Is this what it has come to? Does hardwork never payoff? People should realise how bad the cheating has gotten. only we know our condition properly.  \n",

      "body": "As someone else said, cheating isn't enough to beat cheaters. There are multiple factors when it comes to shortlisting. Some are known: CGPA, resume, performance on OA; some are not visible: how quickly you submit, how quickly you solve each question, the number of attempts you make to solve etc. it's entirely up to the company to decide which parameters to use to shortlist candidates. In such situations, cheating unfortunately gives people the upper hand."

      "body": "It honestly seems like cheating has led to drastic effects in the hiring process now. *Back in my time*, cheating existed but it wasn't exactly *rampant*. What helped is that we did not have any AI agents and chat assistants at our fingertips (this was even before ChatGPT came out lmao). So the only way people could \"cheat\" is by forming groups and solving together, which you can understand, isn't nearly as effective as the solutions that exist today. \n\nUnfortunately, there is nothing you, me or anyone else can do about it. People are taking advantage of shortcuts and while it's unethical and illegal, the lack of real consequences doesn't deter them. Add all the invisible factors that affect the selection criteria, you're essentially looking at the process as a black box since there is no way to explain what's happening. People are giving themself the upper hand in any way possible, even if it means they won't get past a single interview. \n\nAll I can say is, focus on yourself. Hold on. Placements are not a race but a marathon. Pace yourself, you're going to have some Ws and many, many Ls. I myself didn't get placed until mid September or so, and I was in your shoes - almost all my friends were placed and many people known to cheat had gotten offers. Eventually, something will work out. You just need to keep grinding it out and putting in the effort, showing up when it matters most. Eventually, you'll make the shortlist, and since you put in the hard work and time, you'll cruise through the interviews. For now, believe in yourself and keep continuing the focused efforts."

Add other factors that aren't in our control like the bias against international students, slow hiring etc, it's a pretty steep challenge to get any kind of offer here. People are driven to cheat on the OAs because that's the only thing they can control, and even if you solve 100%, it's never enough."
