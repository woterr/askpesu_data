      "body": "BD is not voluminous \nThe slides are small and theory is damn easy. But assignments will take 1 week each and project will take 2 to 3 weeks. Theory is easy not overwhelming but assignments will be hard. \nIf you are average or above average student take it up. \n\n\nDA is voluminous and lot of math going on. "
