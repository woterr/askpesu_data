      "body": "bro make linkedin for connections and career related stuff /reaching out to seniors . Instagram is cool if you want to know only whats happening in your closest circle of say 20 friends if its beyond that it just becomes a huge distraction , endless scrolling ,time waste in reading confessions of who likes whom in your class lmfao . I personally deleted mine for a better life , I found myself constantly comparing my life with my followers and it just sucked. Just call friends once a week or so catch up with their real life, share your problems, ask for help if you need some, keep it real, Only the real ones stay in touch after school . Instagram is only the highlights ,nobody posts their lowlights on there."
