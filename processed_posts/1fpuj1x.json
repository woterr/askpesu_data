More than 25 percent people weren't even eligible for placements and 10 percent of the people go to higher studies.. You are just competing with 65 percent people for placements.. i,e 2160*0.65 = 1404 and assuming 1200 jobs is what pes cse got this year if this would be the same In the next four years the placement percentage would be 85 percent.. I don't think you should expect more than this from a Pvt clg.. So plz stfu and don't consider competition ffs"

So if there's a clg having 100 kids and getting 50 job opportunities is equal to a clg having 1000 kids and getting 500 jobs? Which has more opportunities kid the 50 job offers wala clg or 500 offers wala clg?"
