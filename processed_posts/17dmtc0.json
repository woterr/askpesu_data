I started interning since my Sem 2 and am currently done with 5 internships(in sem 5 right now)\n\nIt gives a huge boost to your resume and confidence in interviews... And most importantly practical skills in the industry, soft skills, workplace politics, etc.... Don't just stick to summer internships and explore stuff while you can"
