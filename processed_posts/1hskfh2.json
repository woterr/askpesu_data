      "body": "Unfortunately most people here (and other Indian colleges) are simply here because of placements. The average Indian does not come from a family with enough financial privilege and power to pursue what they want to, and the only means to a better standard of living is a bigger paycheck. That's why you see most choosing CS (or a derivative) so they can fast-track that process. If something like EEE had been the highest paying branch, everyone would have flocked to that instead."

I also have a love literature, but that isn't exactly a practical choice.\n\n\nI come from a fairly privileged background, and my parents never pressured me into pursuing science; it was my own choice. I enjoy cse so far and perform well in college. Aaand since im female, I may not face the same pressures to earn, but yeah I want to make enough money to be self-sufficient and pursue some of my hobbies."

I was a bright student till 10th and passed out from an ICSE school.Had slightly given up after enduring the pressure in High School. Did pretty well in my 12th boards but couldn't get a branch of my choice in Engineering. I'm right now pursuing EEE at PES and not just the branch but the college itself gives me  back to school vibes. Envying my peers who are having a much more relaxed student life at BMS/MSRIT or even RVCE. And yes I was being pressured since school and felt I'm just studying for their sake."
