  "content": "Yep, you heard that right, all systems went blank during today's ESA and we had to wait for around an hour to get the hardcopy of question paper, during that time, I lost my momentum and you can say kind of fell of the track, Still managed to complete the paper. I wanna know if there is some way we can report this to COE and try to get some grace marks?",
