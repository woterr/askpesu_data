      "body": "Unfortunately, 2022 was a year of anomaly. In 2022, the kcet counseling happened way after jee counseling due to which the cutoffs dropped way more than expected. For example in 2021, CSE at EC campus closed around 2700 but in 2022 it went all the way up to 5k ig. Refer 2021 and 2020 cut offs for best understanding"
