But placements aren't that great if you just depend on college level knowledge. Finding jobs are a little harder for EEE ppl. My cousin was able to qualify for good placements because he built up his skill set in python and JS. So I would suggest that if you want to be placed in some good company, start building up your skill set in programming and allied fields and also sharpen your communication skills.\n\nAll the best"
