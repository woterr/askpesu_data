      "body": "I worked at CCBD and had a great experience. You can check my old comments for more info, but to summarise, since it's a research internship your experience will depend on the prof and the project. If you are interested in research or want to try out research, CCBD would be a good pick. Ofc as I said, it's not guaranteed to give you a good experience. If you want to stay away from research at all costs, then maybe CIE would be a better fit for you."
