The mails come till the Google Groups inbox but arenâ€™t delivered to the email client at the same time. For instance yesterday I got the IBM email almost half an hour before my friend did and weâ€™re both in ec campus. The friend checked their Google Groups inbox and it was there but the email about it wasnâ€™t sent. Check Google groups directly"
