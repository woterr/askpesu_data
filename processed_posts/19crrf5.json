I had a very bad teacher but I still managed to get A.\nPlaying around with the language is important and it helped me a lot even for later sems.\nBtw Install gcc \nIt will be really helpful if you understand the syntax of the language and understand the concepts of pointers.\nPesu notes (not slides) should be available in pesu media discord server."
