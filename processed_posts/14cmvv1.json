Companies do not show any preference (because they cannot) during placements and both campuses are nearly the same.\n\nIf you visit the pinned posts on this subreddit an see the FAQ post, you'll see the most updated RR CS EC comparison post. You should use that as reference: https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/14c1iym/faqs/\n\nSince you're new, you should also check out all the FAQs - they'll help you out"
