From outside perspective (someone who didn't opt for them, but had several friends take it), it's free 2 credits kinda sorta. You need to work hard for the esa, but it will be pretty chill throughout the semester. The esas are not standard written cbt, but a pitch for your product kind of a deal. Do that well and you ace it. (Also, I say free 2 credits because even if you mess it up, you are getting a B minimum as long as you didn't just wake up and show up for the esa without any prep)."

      "body": "I struggled in some subjects in my 3rd semester as well. However, I would recommend going for it if you have any entrepreneurial aspirations after college. Not for the course itself, but the nature of the course should ideally allow you meet more like minded people within the college.The thing is that some 3rd sem subjects are really important ( data structures). If you are in the gear for studying this semester, then I don't think you will face any issues with managing CIE. The last week might get a little bit hectic, but it would be worth it if you push through. Point being that it should not ideally hinder you if you are even a bit serious regarding college. \n\nAnother thing to note is that since you get 2 credits during the semester itself, you will have less pressure for attending summer courses and more time to go home (if you are coming from anywhere outside Bengaluru) or do summer internships :p\n\nAlso, free gpa."
