There might have been a branch when EC campus was still under VTU. \n\nIf you mean Information Security, then go ahead. I took it last year."

If you don't understand ask doubts the teachers are ready to help. \n\nThe syllabus is not that large honestly. \n\nThe assignments are not too hard. They are honestly the most interesting and fun assignment to do out of all the subjects. \n\nExams are easy overall. It was the highest scoring elective for my batch."
