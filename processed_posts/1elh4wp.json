      "body": "As someone who stayed in the hostel for 3 years, the hostel director will say a bunch of this shit just to scare you. Maybe the first semester they'll try to scare you a bit. They stop caring eventually and you'll find ways around every rule they put in place. We used to host full scale parties, get drunk, have overnight gaming sessions, watch movies, sports, everything you can name. So it's chill, the curfew can be a bit annoying though. \nI also know a lot of people who snuck out and never got caught, there are ways around everything.\n\nI'm not endorsing any of these activities, just making it clear that the hostel is never what it's made out to be. They're going to be some of the best years of your life so don't forget to have fun!"
