      "body": "# Lack of goth girls on PESU campus\n\nAs a second year boy at PESU EC college, I am saddened at the lack of goth girls who study here. The majority of girls here are Lana del Rey and Taylor Swift fans wearing kala kurtas and baggy jeans with a serious lack of personality and originality. I know that the nearly nonexistent representation of the goth girl subculture at PESU colleges is likely tied to a few aspects, like how PESU colleges are infamous for its grand parties and Fests, (not typically a goth girl interest) the constant depressing and cold atmosphere, and the overall lack of awareness about goth culture here. \n\nI know that my fellow PESU male students are also disappointed at the lack of goth mommies here, they likely just hide their pain better than I am capable of. Or even Perhaps I am merely looking in the wrong places. I believe without finding a goth girl my mental health will continue to plummet and I may also have to look into transferring to DSU or Christ if this issue does not get resolved."
