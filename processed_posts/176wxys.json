Maybe a little since you joined late, but second sem will be much more chill for sure. Studying a week or two before isa is more than enough to get a reasonable gpa. \n\nFor now I recommend you just grind till you're up to speed and then it's smooth sailing hopefully"

I am in 3rd year , i already got an internship 80k+ per month + 1 Research paper released . I have friends in IITs, they still didnt get internship offer. I would say bangalore played a major role in my internship offer. Also this research paper publication you dont find in any other college, only in PES people are regularly trying to write paper and publish. \n\nMy only advice is work hard PES is a good college, try to be the topper/best student of your batch. You will get the best MS colleges (like CMU etc) or best placements. Grind hard and dont think about the past. (I was also very sad i didnt get IIT after 12th , i gave up on studies but i got my confidence back) Dont think PES is a bad colleges thats all , if you work hard you will get good results."
