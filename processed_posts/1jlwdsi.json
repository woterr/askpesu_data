  "content": "Context: Student from EC Campus. Bought the ticket 3-4 days ago.  \nThe issue is that I still haven't received confirmation of my ticket on my email. Now when I went & bought the ticket, the person asked me to type my contact details into her phone's notes app. I assumed that she'd have to manually put my details into the system later but seriously? It's been almost a week now and I haven't gotten the confirmation yet.  Unfortunately, I don't have contacts of anyone who'd come to our campus for selling the tickets so I can't personally speak to anyone about it. If you guys could help me out, it'd be greatly appreciated.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2ojlngjsxfre1.png?width=1084&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb0f4a10d902be1f023b4c90faee58ff85b2a233\n\nAttaching proof of payment:  \n  \n",
