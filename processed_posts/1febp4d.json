  "content": "The women on this campus are out of control. The first time I wore my “There are only 10 types of people in this world, those that understand binary and those who don’t” CS shirt to lunch, no less than 3 different women tried to sit down and chat. Like I would know how to talk to a girl! Naturally, I demonstrated superior knowledge of each of their niche interests, which apparently disqualifies me from the dating pool (seriously, why shame someone for being smart?).\n\n\n\nAnyway, that got them to leave, but the problem has persisted over the past couple of days. I’m honestly so fed up with everyone wanting to get with me. I’ve taken to moving all the other chairs at tables I sit at in GJB canteen or 13th floor to other tables, just to avoid people trying to sit with me. But yesterday, some small goth woman literally pulled up a chair and started going on about the latest Design “project.” Like, girl, I don’t struggle with projects that are just glorified origami. After making it crystal clear that I did NOT, in fact, want to copulate in the middle of the Student Lounge, she finally left me alone. But I wish these girls would stop throwing themselves at me just because I’m studying the hardest degree on campus (which, by the way, was not difficult for me to get into).\n\n\n\nThe worst is when students from non-technical degrees start talking to me. We’ll be having a decent, totally platonic conversation, and then comes the inevitable question: “What do you study?” The moment I say those magic words, I see their whole demeanor change. The doe eyes, the blushing, the obvious attempts to impress me. What makes a BBA or Architecture student think they have a chance? CS and these basic degrees are on entirely different planes of existence. I’m not about to have some intellectual affair with someone whose “work” consists of giving PowerPoint presentations.\n\n\n\nYou might think it’s because I’m remarkably handsome (which, to be fair, I am) but my attractive friends in ECE or Mech don’t have these problems. It’s like the girls at PES see me as an object and a genius, when in reality, I’m so much more: I’m top 100 in BGMI. My Computer Science shirt shouldn’t reduce me to a bag of meat. If you want my heart, you have to grind with me, star all my repos, and most of all, be able to watch Star Wars with me and actually understand it—no fake fans. I’m not interested in people who can’t even appreciate the gravity of the “I am your father” scene in The Empire Strikes Back (not that I cried, or anything).\n\n\n\nIf you’re after something shallow, just head over to the Mechanical Block or BioTech department. Stop fetishising my kind for something I can’t control. I didn’t ask to be born a genius. Honestly, sometimes I wish I was a Design student, blissfully ignorant, not burdened with the responsibility of saving the world by creating the next Facebook or whatever billion-dollar startup I’m destined to lead. But that’s my fate and I don’t have time for these incessant advances. Gently walking past me in the Quadrangle or posing by GJB Library isn’t going to work on me. Come back in a Mandalorian costume, solve the three-body problem, build your own OS, make an AI model or land a gig at Google or Atlassian—then maybe we’ll talk.",
