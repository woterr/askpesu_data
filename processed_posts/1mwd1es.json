Cause to solve isa and esa questions you need to understand the topics thoroughly.If you understand everything that's taught in class , u will be good to go.\nYou can study topic wise in textbook , all the sections which are needed will be mentioned in your syllabus plan."

Some guy on YouTube(god bless him) has solved every problem in this textbook in ample detail. Do those and you will be good to go."
