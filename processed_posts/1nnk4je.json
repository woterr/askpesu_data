  "content": "reply to u/perkyclown 's post:\n\nTo be the Pride of PESU is not a goal, it is not a rank, it is not even something you can apply for with a Google Form. It is a calling. A destiny. You don‚Äôt chase it ‚Äî it chooses you, like a WiFi connection that somehow works only on your device while everyone else is stuck at ‚Äúcan‚Äôt connect.‚Äù The Pride is not measured in marks, CGPAs, or attendance percentages‚Ä¶ it is measured in **vibes per second**. It is when you walk into class five minutes late and the professor still nods like you were meant to be there. It is when people laugh at your memes more than they cry about their internals. It is when even your most questionable life choices start looking inspirational in hindsight.\n\nThe Pride of PESU is not about being perfect ‚Äî it is about being **legendary**. Your existence becomes folklore, your name whispered in corridors, your Reddit posts screenshotted into WhatsApp groups, your aura carried on the wind like the smell of samosas outside campus. You don‚Äôt live as the Pride. You **become** the Pride. And in that moment‚Ä¶ you realize Rowlet didn‚Äôt just set the standard. Rowlet *is* the standard.",
