What I feel is ppl with 2000+ rank who didn't came in the first round(thinking that they won't get CSE) will come in the second round most prolly after seeing the cutoffs of the first round. \n\nWell that is just a possibility. You still have a very slim chance."

The option is not always available evry year, and if it is, u need a gpa of 9.7 or 9.8+,and scoring 9+ itself is a huge deal in pes, \nSo, don't take ece if u r not interested hoping to study hard and stuff for branch, coz u never know what might happen.. And u will be stuck with ece for the remaining 3 yrs."
