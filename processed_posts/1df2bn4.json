  "content": "I'm currently in 2nd sem and will be done with ESAs on Tuesday. I'm going to be shifting from Amaatra to EC Campus hostel. So how does the clock room thing work. Do we just keep our luggage in a common room shared by a lot of students or do we get individual rooms to be shared with 5-6 people? Is it safe to keep open luggage(Carry bags with stuff) in there or is it advisable to just take all the luggage back home.\n",

U must have submitted ur and ur future roommate's names to the warden(the one who looks like Sunil gavaskar) and not the other ones as me and my roommates got scammed last year by the other warden"
