      "body": "1. Yes, solving PYQs for both ISA and ESA helps you assess your prep and practice problems similar to those in your exam. They might not repeat the exact same questions, but the overall pattern does remain the same. \n\n2. If you have a resource to prepare from, why not use it? You should know by now that scoring well at PES isn't easy and requires hard work and time. Cover as many resources as you can. Its the only way to do well here."
