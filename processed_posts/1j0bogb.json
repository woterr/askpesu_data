The people who teach the subject are the most careless people i have seen. i'm even surprised how did someone thought  that they can teach cybersecurity . \"don't click on spam emails\" , \"Phishing\" . literally these are the only thing that they know from the course . Never expect to learn any technical things from them . the one who teach Information security is god awful .  They intentionally push labs down your throat during isa's weeks . The only course i liked was Network Security ."
