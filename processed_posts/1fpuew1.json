  "content": "I'm so done with PES Cafeteria(RR campus GJB cafe)\n\nThere was a mad rush/crowd\n\nFelt like I was inside one of those BMTC buses during peak hour\n\ntried to get to the cafe asap but still LONG ass queue\n\nThe guys weren't following the token system even though it was printed on the bill and I had to yell to get my food\n\nonly to be left with 9 minutes to eat, I of course wasn't able to finish my food\n\nplease don't get me started on the fact that they expect us to also use the washroom in the same time and refuse to give us \"bio breaks\" as they call it. Like let me just use the washroom its not that deep\n\nI understand maximizing seats but at least upgrade the facility to hold the number of students\n\n3 measly shops in the main canteen catering to like 500-600+ people, what nonsense  \nat least the food isn't horrible, I might try some of the other cafeteria's tmw idk\n\nIma guy who lives alone and only have about 30 minutes to make, eat breakfast and then get ready  \nI cant cook lunch on days when classes extend past 3pm\n\noutside catering defeats the whole point of there being 3 canteens but its looking like my only option",
