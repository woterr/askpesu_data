In the end, the total must be atleast 75%. If you fail to have the minimum, there will be makeup classes towards the end of the semester which you can attend to claim attendence. Personally, I've seen it happen only for one semester. COVID happened after that and I don't know of the current status of such classes."

The VC verified the certificates then and there, signed them and asked him to submit them to the COE. He also missed the ISAs during his absence, so the whole VC verification might've been necessary. But I'm guessing you won't need that. As for what you should do now, I frankly don't know."
