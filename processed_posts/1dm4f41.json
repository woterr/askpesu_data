      "body": "The language you choose to start does not really matter, you should focus on learning. Having said that, there is a bunch of stuff you can do with C++. Thus, I recommend you to start with C++/ C Programming in case you are starting out your coding journey .\n\nIt is not bad to start with C++. It looks complicated, you will bash heads with it, but once you grasp its concepts, it's actually a fun language to program with. I recommend learning the newer standards in C++. You'll eventually learn more languages. Since the basic principles are mostly universal amongst them, **C++ is just one of the many options to start with.**\n\nYou may want to do the [CS50 Harvard Course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/) to get a clear idea on what programming language you want to start off with.\n\nIf you really want to be proficient with programming your initial goal should not to be to learn a language, but rather ***to learn Computer Science***!!! The goal here is different because you learn concepts not the language per se.   \n  \nNote - If you learn C or C++, you learn how to **really program**. Everything after that is just syntax.\n\nGood luck!"

      "body": "Adding to this - there's no point learning a bunch of languages because learning multiple languages doesn't really help you. Learn the language needed to solve a particular problem. \n\nAll programming based courses here - Python, C in first year and C++, Java in second year - these are all courses that teach the language right from the basics. So even if you don't come in with a programming background, it's manageable.\n\nThe only course I do recommend taking up is the MIT Missing Semester course, because none of it's topics are covered as part of the CS syllabus but you will be expected to pick up all of the topics by the time you start working."

I'd suggest start with codewithharry's new python course and do all the practice sets, the first semester cs course will be cakewalk."
