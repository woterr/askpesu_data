  "content": "I tried searching online for any seniors or posts regarding summer internship at cRAIS but couldnt find any. Couldn't find much in the discord either. Are there any seniors here who could tell me about their experience and is it worth it for a cse 2nd year student or if I should just focus on learning at home?",
