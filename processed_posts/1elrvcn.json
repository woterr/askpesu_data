Here's a simplified version of your request:\n\n---\n\nI'm currently a 5th-sem CSE student and interested in both network security (I’ve taken networking electives) and web development (currently im learning through online course). I’m ready to learn both areas, but I’m worried about not doing well during placements if I focus on these two interests. I haven't started studying DSA yet, but I plan to learn Java for DSA. Can you give me advice on what to focus on in my 3rd year to improve my chances of getting placed without any issues?\n\n---",
