I honestly don't know.\n\nBut I'm just generalizing,not everyone is the same. And yeah it did get a lil hectic too, changing syllabus,shitty prof, difficult papers(idk how it was during ur time,but in some subs 300+ ppl are failing), rigorous evaluation policies i.e too much breaking down and distribution of marks to do many projects,case studies etc etc.\n\nCapstone is now from 5th sem itself,and job market uk better than me,I'm just a sophomore.\n\nJust wrote this after listening to a shitty class,ig peeps will add more points below this"

And few semesters in, I am not even top 100 of my batch in cgpa ðŸ˜‚ never managed to get one mrd/cnr scholarship as well. Lot of competition everywhere. I really felt lost and started doubting myself. \n\nThankfully I had few really really good seniors who gave me right suggestions and inputs. I will be really grateful for them. That came really handy for me throughout engineering.\n\nAt the end, had a decent GPA and got into a great T1 company. Now when I look back, definitely I can say that things are bit stressful sometimes in PES compared to other colleges but it is all WORTH it. Trust me, you are going to resonate to this after few years :)"

It's the first time I'm reading about this argument and I genuinely want to know on what basis you're claiming this, especially given the fact that the age gap isn't much (as you mentioned - at most 4 years) so everyone went through the same COVID phase. \n\nWe had similar (if not higher - although I'd argue that you guys definitely have quite a few quality of life benefits such as reduced attendance criteria and prep resources) workloads and yes we complained as well but it honestly feels like with each incoming batch there's just an exponential increase in hate for the profs and uni, complaints about life, workload and stress, and ofc the general brainrot that fills the batch - but overall, there's just a pretty big rise in how much people dislike everything about this place and the constant complaints about everything. I've seen 5 batches of juniors join college since my first year and I've never felt so strongly against a batch. Is your generation really getting dumber or is PES' intake really going down in quality?"

For my batch at least, we all graduated both 10th and 12th grade without depending on digital notes/slides etc so our first instinct was still the book when we joined college as well - also we didn't have anything else so we didn't have a choice. IMO while digital media is great, always having to depend on a smart device also makes you more prone to distractions especially if all those apps are a tap away.\n\nI agree with the rest of your points - profs aren't that great anymore and the current batches are just iPad kids who don't know how to read a textbook and only survive on YouTube to learn."
