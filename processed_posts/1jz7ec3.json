And plus we have like 2 month summer break utilise that time to get a 6-8 weeks internship done, it could be a startup, mnc, whatever help align your goals. Not only does it look great on your CV, it will help YOU learn so much more that the college doesn't teach you.\n\n I've been interning and working part-time since 11th grade, financially this also will benefit you greatly and you can save up now while your parents take care of your financial needs, and with the right investments, you'll have money saved up for essentials later!"
