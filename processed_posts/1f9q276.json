I also applied for college bus but they said they will confirm after 2 days. So anyone already travelling to ec campus in and around RR nagar , how have you managed so far and what mode of transport do you use ?",

If you're halfway in the travel in the morning and realise you forgot a book or some other item you're screwed. Plus you can't participate in clubs or other activities properly solely because of the travel back home.\nYes it's costly but in the long run it'll make much better sense trust me."
