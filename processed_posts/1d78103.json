      "body": "Honestly depends on how well you can manage your time tbh. I manage to study what was done in class (at least an hour), I still find time to hit the gym everyday, and work on my personal projects (if not everyday, then at least on weekends). Yes, things get a little tight when the assignments are due, or during the last week of the sem when we have lab exams and tests and all that, but then I just don't go to the gym daily, and there's enough time for me to finish all my stuff. I also travel for an hour coming to college and an hour going back home, so ye.\nDepends on personal ability at the end of the day, if you can focus well in class, listen to what the teachers are saying and understand something, then you have less work at home while studying, glossing over it will be enough. \n\nPS: I'm a first year tho, so I don't really know how cramped the syllabus is (apparently the 3rd sem syllabus is filled to the brim), but this is my 2 cents at the moment about the whole too hectic thing. Maybe I'll find out next sem, if shit goes down ðŸ’€"
