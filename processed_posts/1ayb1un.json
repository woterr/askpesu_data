So in that regard PES would be better. \n\n\nHowever, the exposure and opportunities that NIT Surathkal can offer you is leagues and leagues ahead of anything PES can offer. PES is a school. This isn't a \"University\". It's a school that has some clubs on the side. That can be a good thing or a bad thing. That's up to you. \n\n\nPES is a lot more upto date with respect to syllabus. That is one thing I can honestly praise PES about. They are always trying to update the syllabus and change stuff up for the better. That's something NIT Surathkal can't even compete with. \n\n\nTL;DR: NITK gives better opportunities and exposure. PES has better syllabus, upto date subjects and is constantly changing( slightly for the better)"

      "body": "I think i can answer this. I got Chemical in NIT Surathkal and i paid the fees and booked that seat. But when i got CSE in PESU i switched here , just because of branch. And i can 100% say that this was the best decision of my life.  The branch matters a lot , everyday i see on the linkedin , Job openings for BTech in CSE , but you will never find a opening like that for other branches.\n\n  \nI am in 3rd year, And i have already completed a internship in US company. Also through campus placements i got a PPO offer + summer internship 2024 in a big US company ( stipend 1lakh+). So i would say if you really work hard in PES, you can get lots of good things from them. The clubs are great (I have gone to IIT Bombay for a competition through my club). Sports facility is great, boys hostel is really fun ( Really costly tho). But the best thing about PES is its located in bangalore, the IT hub of india. You will get lots and lost of opportunity here, i have friend in iit kharagpur, who are still searching for internships. So it really depends on you. I also know people in NIT surathkal CSE who are really struggling to find a opportunity. I would say till now easily 20+ really good companies have come to PES for summer internships ( Which is not happening in Top NITs). \n\n  \nThe seniors are great in PES, i know many seniors doing Masters in US (in top colleges like CMU), they are supportive and helpful. That said this is only my experience in PES, I know people in my class which really hates pes. But it depends on you 100%.\n\n  \nBecause i left the seat after the last round , i lost around 80k Rs but i feel it was worth it. Civil/Chem has no value in the market right now. Go for CSE , or worst case electrical branch. Location of the college also matters a lot."
