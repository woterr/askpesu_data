I made some great friends (and *more* iykwim) at PES. Will you have a movie/tv show-esque college life with house parties happening every week? Nope, people are busy with academic work most of the time. Also depends on how *much* social is a social life for you. You may not find time to go out with your friends week in and week out but you'll definitely get time to meet up once in a while. Yes, PES keeps people busy and working but if you can manage time well, scale your priorities and limit your expectations, you'll find the social life you're looking for."

I had a very introverted friend of mine popup with a girlfriend and a huge gang of friends going to Wonderla every weekend lool. but he also said college sucked, but hey, the social life> study life innit"
