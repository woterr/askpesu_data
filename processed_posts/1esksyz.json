      "body": "Most people grind LC only in their third year. Placements do not only depend on your problem solving abilities but also your entire profile. Now is the time to explore and figure out your interests so you can align your resume towards a certain field by building relevant projects and through relevant experiences. There are more details on this in the FAQs."

      "body": "Nah, you don't need to grind CP. As long as you have good problem solving abilities and your fundamentals are clear, you have a good shot. A lot of people including me did not bother with it to get placed. You don't have to memorise answers, if you do that you won't make a good engineer (and it'll show at work lol). Doing CP will not give you the edge in any college. Having a good profile will. The goal of CP is to build problem solving abilities. If you develop this skill, that's all you need. If you pay attention during DSA courses, that's enough to cover the basics.\n\nAnd online assessments also include CS topics like OS, CN, DBMS etc."
