  "content": "Actually I am a dropper , there is a long story but in short I will take pesu cse next yr if I don't get rv cs. Pesu cs through jee. Basically I have fucked up my 75% criteria by a bit and I don't feel giving improvement is worth it cuz I ain't no prodigy I am a mediocre student I know I am not gonna get anything above 97%ile for which pesu is best imo and if I do well I have nsut dtu IIITB so imo giving improvement wasnt too ideal. Since I have very limited options from last 3-4 days I have been very worried about the counselling process thinking in mind that I'll do well in jee but fuck up the counselling process.\n\nI tried searching for any post related to pesu jee counselling process but couldn't find any detailed post listing the procress so I just wanted to know the counselling process for btech admissions via jee route.\n\nThanks in advance 🙏❤️",
