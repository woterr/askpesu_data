      "body": "I actually happen to be an expert on this (according to my friends atleast) \n\n1) start rubbing your eyes, touching your forehead like you have a headache etc. the teacher will probably think you are unwell so they will be chill if you sleep \n2) choose the right time, if the teacher is repeating a topic or revising you can sleep. Alternatively choose the days carefully do not consecutively sleep in every one of their classes. Interact when you are awake and sleep peacefully.\n3) as many have mentioned you can either sleep on your hand while \"looking down at your book\"\n4) try sleeping for 10-15 min intervals not more than that, most teachers are chill with it (although I've managed to sleep for 30 minutes don't risk it lol)\n5) if you are sitting in the middle rows it is easier to sleep \n6) most teachers are chill with you sleeping but don't make it a habit. If your teachers don't allow it do not risk it cause some have even attempted to cut internal marks. \n\nHope this helps lol :)"
