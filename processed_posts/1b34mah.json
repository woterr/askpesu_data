Once we had 5 internals, so we had tests every alternate week.\n\nAnd as for the projects, you'll most likely complete them at the end of sem, and the submission for all the projects, lab works and other such things is together in a single week, so that gets stressful too."

Teachers are friendly(some aren't). Events happen regularly. The Dean is great...\n\nThere are some things that the college expects as well... That is good grades and attendance... I get it you don't wanna attend classes cuz it's boring... But in the end that's a problem everywhere... If you really don't want hassle for attendance just go to bits"
