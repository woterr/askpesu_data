  "content": "Hi everybody, \nI'm currently a PhD student. I graduated from my master's in 2024. I worked extensively on my master's application in 2021 and 2022. I also had a small startup where I worked with other people on developing a good strategy for their applications. We worked on business school and engineering school applications for about 15-16 people. I've also worked on PhD applications for about five people, including myself. \n\nI have time in the weekends to help a few people with their masters and general inputs on higher studies. \n\nIf this could be something that's useful to you please reach out. \n\nPS - I posted earlier about this but I realized a bunch of questions are coming up about applications and higher studies. \n\n",
