This isn't just a bit of irony; it's a huge red flag for how fragile and vulnerable they actually are deep down, hiding behind all that tough talk. It really shows a serious lack of empathy, not getting how damaging their words can be until something drastic happens. This should be a massive reality check, a moment to hit pause and think hard about changing. Learning to weigh our words and actually giving a damn about others isn't being soft; it's leveling up as a human."
