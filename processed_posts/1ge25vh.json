What do you think happened to all the professors from branches that were cut down in the number of seats or completely axed? They are still here teaching courses they aren't qualified to teach and that's why they are dissatisfied with their job. You will many such profs in CS taking up AIML courses without prior experience in it.\n\nOfc, this is just a side note and has nothing to take away from his misconduct during classes."
