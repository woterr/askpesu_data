  "content": "I have just gotten enrolled in cse, ec and the boys hostel fees this year have hiked so much and no options either. Just 4 sharing. And it's 152000 including 30k caution. So what are the options for pg, the price, type and if some include mess or not. And the distance of pg from campus. And also should I go from bus or not cuz it's 50km from my house and reading the senior's experience with long travels got me against the idea.\n",
