  "content": "Hey PESU community,\n\nI‚Äôm a first-year MCA student joining PES University (via PGCET) now, and I‚Äôm already two weeks late because I got my seat confirmed in the second round. My classes have already started, and I have only one day left to shift (Sunday).\n\nI‚Äôm urgently looking for a single room near PES University. I don‚Äôt need a 1BHK or a kitchen‚Äîjust a simple single room would be perfect. If anyone knows of available options, please let me know or connect me with someone who can help.\n\nIf I can‚Äôt find a single room immediately, I‚Äôll stay in a PG for a month and continue searching, but I‚Äôd really appreciate it if someone could point me in the right direction.\n\nHelp me out, guys!\nYour suggestions or leads would mean the world to me. \nThank you!",
