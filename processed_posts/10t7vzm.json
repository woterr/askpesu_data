It's a pretty difficult year, and increasing your CGPA is pretty difficult. Your goal should be to maintain your CGPA the next year. \n\nBut to answer your question, you'll have companies visiting for summer internship towards the end of your 5th semester (around November/December) all the way till March. So placement prep is something that definitely should be on your mind. Even if you don't manage to get a summer internship, it'll help you for actual placements in final year. You don't need to take out all your time for it, but putting in the effort will absolutely help you out later. It'll decrease the effort needed later and give you a head start over your batchmates in terms of being prepared. \n\nAt the same time, you should also start building your profile. Unfortunately CSE placements aren't as easy as knowing the syllabus, you need to actually know things beyond it and be skilled enough to get selected. Build your resume, learn some skills, preferably in your field of interest, work on projects and generally make yourself worth recruiting. I'll repeat, knowing the syllabus isn't enough in any way. College teachers barely 5-10% of the actual skills you'll need for placements or for a job. Having those skills and showing them during your interviews and applications will only help you more. \n\nSome research clubs on campus like CCBD also take interns at this time. If you don't get anything else, I'd highly recommend you to join *something* so you're productive during the summer break.\n\nAt the same time, don't stress it. It's your last proper summer break before you enter the constant hustle in life. A year from now you'll be occupied with Capstone, internship/placement prep, Masters applications etc. Balance it out, make sure you give yourself time to breathe and also make the most of your time. Enjoy the break but also don't forget about what lies ahead."
