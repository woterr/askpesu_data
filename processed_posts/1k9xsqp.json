Don't act soft just cause me and every other sensible adult is calling your generation's insufferable behavior out. \n\nYou guys are grown ups. Act like it. Being defensive about incellish behavior gets you nowhere."

Remember when a professor had to smash a student's phone in class because they wouldn't stop using it? Or the multiple incidents where students were caught cheating during exams? Let's not pretend that your generation were saints.\n\n\nAgaIN?\n\nBring on the 10 page answer and link a pdf too i am waiting and ur link doesn't work just like your logic"

You must be a whole new level of insecure to feel offense at every feedback you get. Must be tiring to always feel offended every time someone takes a shot at your batch. \n\nBunch of soft kids who can't take criticism, that's what you are. Keep defending your batch even though you've not done anything wrong - that's not going to win you any cookie points, nor change everyone's opinion of the deterioration that's evident every year. \n\nYour generation's zero accountability and apathetic attitude will be your downfall, and I'll be there to watch. Today it's your peers at uni pointed out your flaws, tomorrow it'll be strangers. Don't believe me? Wait and watch. The world doesn't simply pass by without calling you out. \n\nNow go touch some grass."
