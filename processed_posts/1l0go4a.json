  "content": "If you were to arrange MIT (Manipal Branch), MSRIT, BMSCE, RV AND PES in hierarchical order how would it be?\n\nI scored 60 marks in DCET and 9.2cgpa in diploma. Rankkâ€Ž predictor suggests I can expect a rankkâ€Ž of 2000. \n\nIf youre not a lateral entrant but know a lateral entrant, please ask them and share here. Thank you.",

As for manipal I gave the documents and got selected but by then my interest was in to join PES after looking the crowd and facility. I'll suggest you visit the campus of college you want to join and then only proceed."
