  "content": "I need to make a decision quick between two colleges PESU RR cse-aiml in bangalore or SSN chennai cse core. i am from bangalore and some may say pesu is the obvious choice, even the fees is much lesser in pes(6-7 lakh for 4 years where as 25l in chennai). But also the intake in pes is currently around 2200 for both campuses but here it is only 180 students. So want to know what you guys will choose placement opportunities is only slightly better in pes",

Yeah jee is tougher than kcet agree but saying you can top the people who went through all this is totally senseless.I have also seen students who were eligible for iit/nit just chose pes because they didn't wanted to leave their hometown for iit/nit"
