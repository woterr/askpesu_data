What I would suggest is that you introspect on what you really want to do (was your low CGPA out of laziness,  or not liking the course?) and then work towards it. \n\nRight now, i think what would work for you is working your butt off for the next year and then off-campus placements or studying for and getting into an MBA course through an entrance test.\n\nDon't give up hope! While there's no easy fix, you can always put in the work to improve from where you are."
