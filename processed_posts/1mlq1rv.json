With that CGPA, its going to be challenging to get through to the interview round as well, regardless of how well your OA goes. This is why I keep telling everyone to keep working on their CGPA. Anyway, you cannot do anything about it apart from upskilling so that when you do make it to the interviews, you are a strong candidate. For now, keep applying off campus and don't lose hope. Its going to be a tough ride for you."
