Is it something that should be considered or are there a lot of drawbacks? \nPlease share your inputs to help us make a better and informed decision whether to keep the seat or withdraw before the second round\n\nThanks!

I’m from the 2020 batch and we had over 200. Few senior professors are retiring or are leaving the college\nPartially disagree with rowlet here, Mechanical students are allowed to sit for IT roles as long as you have the requirements. Ofc not all companies allow mechanical students to sit for the exam but quite a few do. I got placed for a consulting role so the opportunities are endless. DM if you want to know anything specific"
