Companies place branch filters and most IT companies allow only CS and ECE to sit for placements. No, even if you are in Mech and learn the entire CS curriculum on the side you will not be allowed to sit for these companies. Also certifications are pointless and useless and don't have value unless you can show that you have the skills you obtained through them. Adding them to your resume just wastes valuable space for other information.\n\n> Some of my friends said that one needs to do minor courses in pes in order to sit for placements, is it true?\n\nNope, absolutely incorrect. Check the FAQs for a related question about doing CS Minors being in ECE. Summary is, yes it can help but it does not make things drastically different for you since your major branch doesn't change."
