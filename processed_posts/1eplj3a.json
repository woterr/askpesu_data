Like using clown emojis and using the moai emoji to back his opinion(The thing is that he was definitely pissed about the fact that he was getting any reservation even though he could get SCG reservation but did not because his father is a government employee). He was also saying something like placements in bms>>>>pes. But the thing that got me thinking was when he said that clubs in pes is shit and things like that. Is it true by any chance?"

This mf probably feels superior to the ones around him as anyone could tell by the way he brags and for some reason he thinks that every things he does or has is the best of them all. Fortunately, I have a handful of good friends now who are supportive and most importantly honest. I'm sorry but had to vent it out."
