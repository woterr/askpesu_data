You should know that it's 2024, no company will just hand you a job just for being in a college or for being in a certain branch. You're going to have to be job-ready with industry relevant skills to actually land a job easily. The usual trend at almost every college is that your rank while getting admitted has nothing to do with your CTC."

Thirdly, don't worry about the college you will get, study hard and aim for the best. Obviously the competition is bad everywhere, but that should motivate you to be better. It's as easy as that.

Loosely throwing around these terms when you're at best inconvenienced or face an obstacle undermines those who are actually struggling mentally. Your so-called problems are nothing compared to what they are going through, never equate yourself to them. You're worrying about an exam. They're struggling with their health. There's a big difference.\n\nAnd guess what? Life is challenging. Life has problems and obstacles, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. Nobody here is on a free ride to success. Everyone needs to put in hard work. Get out of your fantasy world, grow up and realise that this is real life. \n\nOne thing I've learnt is that if you see someone doing something \"effortlessly\", it means that they put in hours, days, months and maybe even years of actual effort to reach a stage to perform the same thing \"effortlessly\"."

I was the dumbest in class, like literally the dumbest, I copied my way into the toppers batch at my coaching institute but quickly realised it was a huge mistake. Every jee test,I would score the least in the entire class, like I was literally rock bottom. I realised that jee wouldn't be my thing and I switched to studying and giving my best for kcet around this time last year. I started writing a formula book (it was over 600 pages long) and I started revising it daily. I started solving question papers every single day. Go online. Ull find plenty of books offering question papers. I made sure I did well in my boards and i got a rank of 2xxx, got in through kcet at pes. I've been an average student all my life (never even reached 80% throughout the time I was in school) but trust me man, hard work pays off. In the end I did better than many ppl who didn't work as hard as I did. Don't lose hope. And also I scored 2k rank with them fucking up n giving out of syllabus questions. So calm down. With hard work, ull go wherever u dream to go. Put ur phone down and study. I had a nokia button phone for the entirely of 11th n 12th. Just sit ur ass down, study for 10-12 hours a day. Ull be very happy with ur results. All the best."

In my opinion, with X amount of hard-work for JEE landing you a rank of ~50k, the same X amount of hand-work can get you <1000 rank in KCET. The only thing you need to worry is getting a good rank in KCET rather than thinking of jobs. Prepare the way you need prepare for KCET, not like the way you prepare for JEE. Ex: speed on questions 1/min, 15Qs from 11th which are easier to score than the rest"
