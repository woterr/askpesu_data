  "content": "So recently amaatra wifi has been soo fking bad that people are creating makeshift equipment to get mobile Hotspot example i have seen people tie phone to a selfie stick outside of window and using its mobile hotspot. The wifi blocks almost everything (even things like flipcart) keeping aside the 10mbps we get. The following image is taken \"secretly\" and with +9999 sneak from the phone of warden. I also request seniors to give any work arounds to this problem and to my fellow amaatra victims 🫂🫂🫂 (also in the image i am not sure if they r pertaining to btech esas or bpharma exams or bsc exams)\nIf anyone want us to check any websites if they work or not feel free to ask in discord people there will show proofs 👍\nunrelated rant: (food here is soo bland, ghee rice back at my home is spicier)",
