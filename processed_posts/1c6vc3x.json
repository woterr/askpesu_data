      "body": "I graduated in 2022 - the first time pooled placements took place was for my batch, so I'd say I know what happens. Placements are pooled and there is no way to identify from a company's POV if a student is from RR or ECC. It's been that way for years now for every batch since then. Only PES can identify which student is from campus, the listing by companies includes both campuses always."

      "body": "There's no official metric, but it doesn't make sense to compute it anyway since the number of CS kids at RR is almost triple the number of CS kids at EC today. Number of RR kids getting selected for a T1 job will always be more because of the distribution.\n\nNumbers will always look skewed here and provide a wrong conclusion."

      "id": "l0f0kci",
      "body": "Hmm.\nOk, I don't know the total count of students from ecc campus but u can just contact a ecc class person and ask how many in their section got into T1,T2 and compare it against your class.\n\nMy only reason for pointing it out is because I don't want people to just take ecc considering placements being same for both.\nIt has been same since forever but when u sit for interviews, you will realise the difference."

    {
      "id": "l0f2rqa",
      "body": "As I said, comparing numbers makes no sense cause the distribution is skewed. From a company's POV, they cannot distinguish between a student from RR and EC because both sit for the same tests, both appear for interviews together in the same location. PES does not disclose their campus details. \n\nYou graduated before the changes were implemented. People in the last 3 graduating batches have vouched for there being no difference anymore."
