  "content": "my nephew is getting mechE in BIT via comddk but he is interested in doing CSE from PES EC branch but might get only mgmt quota. is it worth of spending 12lpa for this course here? total cost would be close to 50L by the time he completes it. can he get placed and recover this ROI?",

The scholarship is on the entire money paid not only on the tuition fees. And abt getting placed and recovering it, thats based on how he manages the 3 years and gets placed. Tier 1 meaning he can def recover the ROI in 2-3 years."
