      "body": "Unless you've given it already: \n\nThe assessment has a couple of questions that will ask you the most intrusive and random stuff - \"Are you stressed because of ESAs?\", \"Do you get enough time to prepare?\", \"Are you under pressure to do well?\", etc. They're all MCQs and there are quite a few questions. The gist is this is just another useless form. But they'll ensure you give the assessment and bother you if you haven't, so give it sooner or later. \n\nAs far as I know, there's no visible outcome to this. They just force you to fill it and then keep your data. I remember one kid in my batch filled up everything pointing to he was borderline depressed and PES did nothing anyway lmao."
