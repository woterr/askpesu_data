  "content": "I think I have landed a KCET rank good enough to get PES EC CSE. I want to opt for hostel, and was wondering how the living conditions will be. A few photos to illustrate would be nice. It would be even better if a person studying in EC Campus delivers his insights on the question.",

Then you can wake up at 7:30 and still be on time easily. \n\nIf you're a girl...... You'll be staying in amaatra."
