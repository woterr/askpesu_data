Isn't that what you're looking for? You're in college, get used to reading the book. Don't fall into the downward spiral of getting spoonfed with slides, notes etc. - there will never be any replacement for the textbook. And some of these textbooks are arguably the best textbooks to read for these topics, especially the courses I listed out. Read the book and solve the problems. You'll see the difference on your own. \n\nSlides were always meant for revision, not learning the content. Just because the first year was easy and slides were sufficient, doesn't mean it will continue to work now."

I got asked 4 of the exact same questions from the exercises in the ESA (with different numbers) and this was the only reason I got a B grade instead of a C grade"
