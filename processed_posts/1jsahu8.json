  "content": "How are people okay with the way frisking happened in AT? The volunteers literally touched every single part and yes i mean every single part and asked us to do weird shit like spread your legs like wtf. This isn't even done for ESAs. Bro conveniently asked \"Do I have your consent\" after frisking everywhere, and i didn't even consent to that shit. It was extremely uncomfortable.",
