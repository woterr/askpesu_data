  "content": "I am a nepali national looking into joining either PESU OR BMSCE for Btech in CSE as freshman. Each will cost me overall including hostel around 25 lakh ic for BMSCE and 35 lakh ic for PESU. I wanted to join PESU as there are lots of opportunities other than academics like hackathons and stuff plus the placements are way better than that of BMSCE. The infrastructure is better the accommodationa are better but at the end what I am not sure about is if PESU is really worth the extra 10lakh. Please help!",

If you're going to blatantly make statements, back them up with facts. We don't entertain misinformation here. And FYI, the first was in 2012, with 3 in the last 4 years. \n\nAnd you might want to educate yourself. Please read up on your college's incidents as well, instead of being a clown on a different college's sub."
