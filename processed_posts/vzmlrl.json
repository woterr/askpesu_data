  "content": "My PESSAT rank is in the 850s and I'm aiming for CSE in the ring road campus. Suppose I get a lower preference in the first round, do I hold on to it and attend the second round hoping for an upgrade? Or can you directly join in the second round? And I've heard most of the good CS faculty are gone, student intake has increased. Has quality drastically deteriorated?",

      "body": "Faculty is completely irrelevant to you at this point. And by the way , teachers come and go and that's not a new thing. The PES curriculum is what makes the difference with a strong emphasis on projects. A lot of people who have excellent skills in a specific domain such as ML or web dev are self taught anyway . from what I've noticed PES also has a really good coding culture. I'm not gonna say that the campus rn has the best faculty or whatever but the 'quality' hasn't deteriorated at all and it won't for a good period of time."
