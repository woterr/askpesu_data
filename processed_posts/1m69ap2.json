I have done 1 internship like a decent one, I also have 2-3 good projects. \n\nIs it possible for me to get a placement in tier 1 company. How hard is it? And in placement sheets some places cutoff cgpa is not mentioned , does that mean the company dosent put cgpa criteira.\n\nAlso tell me about off-campus and referrals\n\n",

I believe it starts on August 4 for your batch. \n\nyes, if its not mentioned in placement sheet, the CGPA criteria wasnt there so anyone could apply.\n\n  \nwhat do you want to know about off campus and referrals? Basically there is a lot of competition perhaps outside and right now fresher job market is very bad, and as for referrals they work sometimes and sometimes not, no guarantee really dude."
