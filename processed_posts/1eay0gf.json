Pursuing Computer Science at PES significantly enhances one's resume and attracts top companies.\n\n The university offers numerous opportunities for students to improve their skills and knowledge through various clubs and hackathons. While BITS Pilani holds a slightly higher regard than its Goa campus, I believe the Bioinformatics course doesn't compare as favorably to Computer Science.\n\n Ultimately, placements, skills, and job opportunities are crucial for students after college, and PES RR campus excels in providing these with its strong Computer Science program. \n\nNO OFFENSE TO BITS goa ,  it's just the course that matters . Suppose if u get a chance u can pursue ur CS course in BITS goa . That would worth it"

Its a long comment with multiple linked comments, please go through them. \n\nTLDR - pick the one that best suits what you want to pursue. Pick BITS if you only care about landing the highest-paying job out of undergrad. If you want to study what you are interested in and are passionate about CS, choose PES. The only right decision here is the one which helps you the most."

But if you're a competitive guy and are confident that you'll do well in the first year, you should probably take bits and hope for the best.\n\ni am definitely biased cause im in pes lmao, but i think this is a reasonable take on the comparison"
