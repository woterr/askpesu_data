      "body": "For us it was 3 weeks for 1 credit for a max total of 8 credits. They will mention what dates are included for internship consideration (like you can't claim internship credits in 8th sem if it starts after 8th sem i.e. August onwards or smth)\n\nThe management do not care. As long as you get an internship, you need to inform them if you're getting paid or not and the offer letter they gave you. (usually for CSE, they recognize only paid internships I think)\n\nI had a 6 month internship. Yeah they allow that. I know people who worked as an intern for even longer than that. They don't mind at all."
