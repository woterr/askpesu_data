  "content": "Y'all so I'm in 12th rn and I want to get into PES RR campus (CSE). KCET cut off is around 1k for GM which I dont think I'm capable of (idk) and JEE mains score should be around 85 percentile or 70 marks to go for the JEE management quota. My best bet seems like Management quota which is around 12L pa.   \nI might have to take an education loan. Does anyone have any opinions? Is it worth an education loan?   \nI know the placements are good (provided I have a good cgpa) but yeahh. I fall under above average category 😂 when it comes to studies   \nIts basically a gamble to take an education loan. IF..IF... I don't get a good package or a out of campus job... I'll be stuck in a debt trap. I don't plan on doing masters abroad.. atleast not yet. ",
