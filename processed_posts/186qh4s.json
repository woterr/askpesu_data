  "content": "I'm struggling to get back into the flow of 2-ISA system after 5-ISA system and realized I only have ESAs to make up for my subpar performance, especially in 2 subjects. I'm currently in 5th sem and am really struggling w my elective and MI and am scared that if I don't do well in those, my gpa will drop horribly. Im assuming their totals will be in the mid 30s range out of 50.\nPlease help!",

For other subjects as well, try covering your textbook as well but do that only after your slides. YouTube is King. Learn concepts from there and apply that to understand your slides. Good luck!"
