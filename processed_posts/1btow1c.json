In that scalding heat, we had to stand for 4 hours and draw shit for our machine drawing workshop. In a room with no ventilation, in the middle of the day in March heat. It sucked.\n\nHOD of our dept walked in the drawing room one day and pulled out 4 people (2 girls, the only 2 in the class of 60) and sent them home for wearing track pants. FUCKING TRACK PANTS. ffs it was 2 PM and the temp was reaching 40.\n\nWe did get back at that asshole tho. Someone (who was on the college racing team I presume, and had the mechanical know how) removed all 4 tyres of his car, stacked them neatly next to it, and chalked the axles with bricks wherever one day he forgot that he brought the car to the office and Walked back home.\n\nPetty things like these is the only way we ever got back at these mfs."
