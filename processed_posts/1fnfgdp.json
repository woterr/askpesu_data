You'll have to attend a few class committee meetings with the HoD and maybe talk to a few teachers now and then if there are problems with portions and stuff. Nothing that you can't handle. But it also makes it so that everyone in the class knows your name when not everyone knows each other. Might be a good thing for you. You should go for it"

Not much of additional workload. It's chill and ez. \nAlso depends what are your definitions of chill and ez, yet 10/10 recommended"
