  "content": "Companies using cloud flare lava lamp random picker ahh shortlist.  \nNo use having skills and gpa   \nJust copy and get shortlisted.  \nBruh ppl finished OA in 20-30 min and without any sus got shortlisted.  \nNo wonder if companies dont come next year - get shortlisted fuck up interview -> college lectures everything on why cheating bad -> make it bad for everyone  \nLost all hope to get any Job  \nI wouldn't be surprised if same thing happens for IBM - 1500 ppl eligible + diversity hiring",

Use LinkedIn to build a better network and attend conferences and tech meetups. You are much more likely to land more interviews. And in some cases, even by-pass the random GPA blockers."
