India needs more manufacturing, infrastructure and transportation and with push coming from the center all these are soon to come into demand. And IT companies are hiring less and less freshers by the day. Once AI gets over it's hype cycle and starts to get deployed in big tech the run of the mill coders would be out of jobs. There would be no justification to 16 sections of CSE while only 10 sections everything else combined."
