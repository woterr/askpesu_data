  "content": "just realised something ... \n\n  \nGuys PESU CSE and CSE AI ML total seats are 2280 across both the campuses ... and ECE seats across both the campuses ... 360+180 = 540 ... and assuming that 30% of the ECE people are gonna sit for placements for IT companies .. so 2280 + \\~180 = 2460 people fighting for IT companies right ... and chlo lets remove some non-serious ppl ( coz obv 100% serious ppl hona is very difficult ) so 2200 ig is the right no. and now tell me 2200 people sitting in placements for IT companies .... and i heard somewhere on this subreddit only that good T1 companies take 10-15 people max .... and companies are not gonna increase their intake bcoz people at PES inc their programm intake so isn't PESU turning into VIT , SRM ... bcoz they do the same thing only right ... see i m not saying that PESU is shit and alll VIT also gives high placements but the competition if fierce .... \n\nYES i agree that PES infra is better than other cllgs in Bangalore and it has an updated curriculum as tht followed by other VTU college like RVCE , BMSCE and MSRIT or maybe DSCE ...\n\nYES i agree ki anywhere i go their will be a lot of compe\\_tition and yes compe\\_tition is a good thing but the thing to worry abt is that the median of 13-14LPA of now might turn into a median of 9-10 LPA .... \n\n\n\n\" Median Package means tht 50% and above ppl are getting a salary of XX LPA \"\n\n  \nso people taking admisiion through JM-2025 and Managemeent Quota they are at high risk ... \n\n\n\nKCET QUOTA people for them yes i agree ROI is good but not for JM and management people \n\n\n\nOP got alloted PESU RR CSE AI ML in first round counselling and 1930 ra\\_nk in COMEDK so thinking abt RVCE ETE and MSRIT CSE with some specs .... so sorry to all the PESU lovers ....but seriously i thought this is a major issue abt which no one is talking about \n\n\n\n  \n",

The placements of 2026 batch will go in general way, but considering the market situation there might be a possibility of very large dip also. But surely 2027 batch will have huge competition, considering the number of students, so yeah it's going to be a fierce competition. Even bmsce 2027 batch also has the same intake, so both will face challenges in placing 2027 batch, but considering placement cell will gain some experience in 2027, 2028 batch placements might improve also. But it all depends on multiple factors, intake is not the only factor which affects placements. In the last 2-3 years the market situation has ruined the placements of almost every clg in India. So hope for a good market and may be if you have the right market and right skills, your batch might have highest placement record in the history also. Placement is an uncertain thing, no one can predict what will happen after 2-3 years, so hope for the best"

Its not like this situation is new either, high-intake has been there in places like VIT, SRM, PES, for years. Also, your assumption that only 30% of ECE people will sit in placements is cute. There are far more wanna-be CS people in ECE. Some in the rest, EEE and Mech. BT ppl are usually more interested in their branches and often do masters, so you can leave them.\n\nAnd please, take the branch that your interested in. Don't ruin core branches by taking that, and sitting for CS placements and then later in life complain about either taking a core branch or infecting future generations with the same thought process on how you took it and ended with a good paying IT job. \n\nP.S. Use English and type in English properly atleast. Hinglish is so annoying to read and makes it look very chapri"
