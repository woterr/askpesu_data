PU exam was harder this year compared to the last year PU paper, and this time no grace marks were awarded, last year they gave like 7 marks in chemistry PU  \n3. Many ppl wouldve fucked up looking at the question paper and getting surprised looking at the deleted syllabus (myself included)  \nBut there were 90k more ppl who wrote kcet this year so u can never tell"
