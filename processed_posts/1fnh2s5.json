  "content": "I’ve got a 20k rank in KCET and just finished the second round. I’ve been offered Robotics and AI at BIT, but if I wait for the extended round, I might get ECE at PES (EC campus).\n\nI’m okay with any field as long as it has good job opportunities. I’ve heard that a lot of Electronics students end up in IT anyway, and their syllabus is pretty heavy, so it’s hard to keep up with computer-related stuff.I’m thinking about going into IT, but I’m not sure if Electronics-related jobs will get better in the next four years.\n\nWhat do you think? Should I go with BIT or wait for PES?",
