Anger issues + bad teaching is bad bad bad\n\nVBS the great\n\nChemistry lab teacher , god bless whoever has this guy for actual subjects. He just narrates so much story about himself , you sometimes feel like Nolan sir would make the next Oppenheimer on him. During my initial days I used to trust his stories because I held pes in high standards. He used to body shame people he used to narrate stories of how he cheated with his wife 😭 \n\nJayashree ma'am, not the more famous one\n\nBad teaching , funny expression. Looking at her face and not laughing when she looks at you is the hardest thing you can do in PES. Atleast she lets you do what you want.\n\nChaitra parameshwarappa\n\nShe taught  linear algebra. Made me hate maths which is a very hard thing to do. She used to write random stuff on the board just to pass time. Never properly solve anything. Weirdly passionate about seating arrangements for class tests. The way she writes the letter t is something you should experience at least once in your life time at PES"
