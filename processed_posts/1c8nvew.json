If you are entering core ECE jobs, most preferred is Verilog or any other HDL like system Verilog (taught in PESU). Maybe if you are entering some communication related job, MATLAB and Python are essential tools. There are some specific software tools like CST Studio, EDA Tools, and more as you explore.   \n  \n2. If you are aiming for CSE job, there are a multitude of them, so cannot them all.\n\nRegardless, I suggest you start doing your **Minors in Computer science** from 3rd sem onwards,\n\n3rd sem - DSA  \n4th sem - DAA  \nSummer after 4th sem - OS and DBMS\n\nTrust me, it will be really useful for placements.\n\nAll the best"
