You have to form a team, decide a domain and then contact professors via email asking them to be a guide.\n\nAsk them fast because each professor can only have around 4 teams under them and the popular professors get asked really fast and you may not be able to get the professor you want.\n\nYou decide the topic only after the team and guide are finalized. You have ample time till first review to decide the topic while discussing with your guide.\nThat is what the first review is about: your topic. The panel will see your review, look at the novelty of the topic and then approve it. Only rarely, the topic will get rejected(in case of duplicates)"
