Sitting together and all is fine, but just now there were people dancing under tables, pulling hair, tickling, and giggling. The problem could be me and I should just learn to live with it, but is there some spot that's *not* a frolicking spot?  \n\n\n  \n\n\n~~This post was a joke and I just typed this cause I've been bored of serious stuff and expect some funny answers.~~",
