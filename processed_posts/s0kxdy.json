We had the best teachers previously(2 semesters ago) in the RR campus, but I heard there were changes in the last sem, the course still has to be the same."

Highly recommend getting involved with it even if you don't take the course.\n\n100% the best technical experience I had in college. I'm average at DSA so I'm pretty sure it was the sole reason behind my internship + placement. It also got me a fun final sem internship without any extra running around."
