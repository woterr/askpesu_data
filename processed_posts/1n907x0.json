Try to connect with seniors or alumni who currently work and if you find any available new grad positions in their companies, reach out to them for a referral.\n\nCampus placements, given the current market situation are basically a roll of dice. With odds mostly stacked against you. Not trying to induce fear, sadly that’s just how things are.\n\nKnowing the right people will help you more than you realize"
