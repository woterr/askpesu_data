Don't waste your time on qb and stuff, just take the class notes of someone in your class and most questions will be identical"

Yes i wrote a perfect esa because all the questions came from my friends notes without so much as a value change, but yours may be different\n\nWrite notes if you like, but it's honesty not necessary. I always just used to take photos of someone else's before every isa. Why do the work when there's 60 people in your class doing the same"

I felt it was closer to 10th\n\ntried and tested technique: cover your eyes with one hand (and lean on the hand) and turn your head away from the teacher , hold a pen in the other hand (put it in a position as if you are writting)  \n\n\nworked on 3/5 teachers"
