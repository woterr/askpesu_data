Such activities are normally organised by a set of people trying to collect money from gullible students and in places which are unsafe and dangerous.\n\n\n\nWe have noticed such activities in the past and have reported the same to the concerned authorities, who have taken effective steps to stop them from happening, where our own students would land up as victims.\n\n\n\nThe Vice-Chancellor, Registrar and Dean, Student Affairs, PES University, have been informed about this activity. Parents are also informed, to inform their wards to stay away from such activities.\n\n\n\nStay informed, keep away from these nefarious activities and stay safe.\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nPES University\n\n\n\n\nPadh le beta"
