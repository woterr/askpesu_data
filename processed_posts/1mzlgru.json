  "content": "I heard from few VPs and managers of some companies, that they are willing to come for placement to PESU. But looks like PESU is not able to provide them with the required infra and asking them to do virtual interviews!!. So these companies are still thinking, as most of them don't prefer this method. So they may end up NOT coming for placements this year. Students after paying so much fees, going through all the hardship of joining this so called top college, in this kind of tough job market, are going to be robbed of these precious opportunities. PESU's placement office is completely responsible and should be answerable for this.",

If that test had been online, the shortlist wouldâ€™ve been filled with random people who just know how to cheat without getting caught, instead of deserving candidates.\n\nI think companies are starting to catch on to this, which is why most of the tests in the first and second week were conducted offline on campus. And when I saw the people who got selected in those companies, many of them were genuinely smart and knowledgeable, people I personally know. I canâ€™t say the same about the results of many online tests, even with proctoring.\n\nWhat I also like about offline tests is that even if you donâ€™t get shortlisted, you know the people who did actually performed better and deserved it. But with online tests, itâ€™s so frustrating and demotivating to see random people who cheated getting shortlisted while youâ€™re left out."

Even those who finish the test early with all test cases passing often donâ€™t get shortlisted, while others who didnâ€™t even solve the full problem do. Sure, there might be reasons like plagiarism flags, proctoring issues, or other checks, but in many cases both groups have cheated, and the final list still feels random.\n\nAnd even if the process were perfectly fair, where only those who solved everything got shortlisted, it still wouldnâ€™t fix the bigger issue, the test just becomes a competition of who can cheat faster and smarter without getting caught. That completely defeats the purpose of giving deserving candidates a real chance, because speed at cheating doesnâ€™t make someone the more capable candidate."
