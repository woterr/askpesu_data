  "content": "[I do considered exploring about CS and CS with specialization in AIML and got the following conclusion ](https://preview.redd.it/8425hop51twe1.jpg?width=2450&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5c812ef602b807a9c60b937f45778eb924be848f)\n\n1. CSE (AI & ML) is a **bit more math-heavy and specialized**. CSE is more flexible.\n\n[2.AI](http://2.AI) & ML variant is **more rigorous** in terms of concepts and project-based learning.\n\n3.**CSE is more versatile**, while **CSE (AI & ML)** is future-facing but narrower in scope.\n\n  \nSo; based on my conclusion this is my preference order but seniors is the high fees considerable for the electronic city? Ring Road campus is well established and great Alumini Network so I am ok with that fees!! Additionally I'm not from KA so applying through jee mains is the only option and I have a score of 95.18%ile in jee mains... What are the chances for cs at the ring road campus? and they gave only 4 choices to fill idk why?? So; should I go with the same preferance order or you would suggest any changes? ",

Amount of opportunities are same. Placements are pooled, Hackathons are open to both campuses.\n\nWell listing some perks of RR over EC :-\n- Better fests. [ Not really a deal breaker, its open to both campuses ]\n- At an average, slightly better peer group. [ Try to find ur type of people, its a wide spectrum ]\n- Better Infra. [ Not that it's bad in ECC (better than other blore clgs for sure) ]"
