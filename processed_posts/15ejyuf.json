      "body": "2nd student here one advice when you come from metro and get down in Mysuru road and when you come to bus stop (towards kengeri) never i repeat never take those auto standing there they will charge you 50 rupees per person. \nAlso the bus which goes towards pes is MF-12 that will cost you 10rupees . If you don't get that don't worry walk a bit in front there's a signal and any bus coming to that(towards  Banashankari) signal goes to pes which will cost you 5 rupees.\n\n\nAlso there's a metro shuttle which comes randomly between 7.45-8.05am (two buses) ig which will directly take you to pes. Although considering the crowd that waits for the shuttle you should really need to  be lucky to get in or else take bmtc."

      "body": "Walking from the metro station to the bus stop takes you at most 5 mins, it's technically right outside the metro station. Travelling to PES usually is about 5-10 mins via bus. So I'd say overall once you reach Mysore Road metro it's a 10-15 min journey."
