Don't sacrifice your interests just to follow what everyone is doing. As long as you have interest and put in efforts, you can create opportunities for yourself, regardless of which industry you get into. \n\nIf you'd like to hear from mech people, join the main PESU discord server (was posted here a few days ago, search and find)"
