It tells you which section of the course is taken from which section in what textbook. Some courses have one textbook, some have multiple. You'll find free pdfs online for these textbooks or if you prefer, you can get a hard copy from the library"

      "body": "Adding to this: Not sure if it still happens but the campus mart used to sell photocopies of these books at cheap rates and at the end of the semester they used to buy back these copies. Many students who preferred a hard copy but did not want to invest in the book used to opt for these."
