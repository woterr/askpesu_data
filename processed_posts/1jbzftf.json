  "title": "Regarding Game Hackathon conducted by Parallax",
  "content": "So, I endured a Game Hackathon at PES University Electronic City, organized by the Parallax Club. Let me save you the trouble: DO NOT ATTEND ANY EVENTS CONDUCTED BY THIS CLUB.\n\nLet's just say, 'hack' was the operative word, and they definitely hacked my patience.\n\nFirst off, â‚¹250 for what? A masterclass in disappointment? The 'dinner' was average, the 'breakfast' was a crime against humanity, and 'snacks' were a mythical concept, unless you wanted to pay more at the stalls they conveniently set up after charging us.\n\nMidnight snacks? Let's not even go there. I'm still trying to identify what that... substance was.\n\nGoodies? Oh, they delivered. A keychain that would excite a five-year-old and a radium band. Because, you know, we're all about to go rave in a dark coding cave.\n\nThe 'rubrics' were apparently written in invisible ink, because no one saw them. No paper reviews, just vibes. Bad vibes.\n\nThe schedule? A chaotic masterpiece. A final review at 11 AM meant we foolishly rested at midnight, only to be ambushed with a 5 AM review. Then, at 8 AM, they decided to dramatically eliminate half the teams. Without warning. Seriously, why not just tell us at 5 AM? We were still working!\n\nVolunteers? Picture a pack of grumpy toddlers wielding clipboards. No AC in the sweltering heat, and the event hall was basically a mosquito breeding ground. It was like coding in a swamp.\n\nInstead of that useless radium bands they could have given lays. Lays are better than that radium band.\n\nThis wasn't a hackathon; it was a psychological experiment. I'm pretty sure I saw someone coding in Morse code using mosquito bites.",

If we atleast knew when each review was we would have planned accordingly.\n\nThis event just seemed to be half assed.. yeah honestly a waste of 250 rs"

TELL ME WHERE THE FUCK CAN YOU DO THAT ?)\n\n\\-further dissecting the 150 bucks, you prolly paid 15-18 rs for electricity, water supply.  \n\\- 50 bucks prolly goes towards managing the promotion and the props needed for the event, \n\nwe are left with about 70 bucks \n\ndont forget, all the incharges of food and security worked OVER FUCKING TIME, you paid some portion of their income too, remove another 35 bucks for that\n\nwe are left with 35 bucks now...\n\nwondering where that 35 bucks went ?

      "body": "Alright,I will not take it in the sarcastic way that you have intended, and I'll give you a bit of advice as your senior (I have passed out so pls). \nFirstly, if a lot of people tell negative stuff about your event, then there is a high chance the event was conducted poorly. Own up to it, and learn from it. Do not cry Abt it.\nSecondly, please remove this mentality of \" I am always right the world is always wrong my way is the perfect way\", no one is perfect, no event conducted is perfectly. I was part of a few clubs, and to be Frank one of the pop up events we conducted was an absolute flop where the volunteers and the organisers had no connect and the participants suffered. We did not tell deal with it, instead we took it as a good feedback and did better in the next event.\nThirdly, there is a point to be made that your budget planning was horrible, because of you are comparing to what someone has to buy from outside to make a dish for let's say even 3 people, to how much one person eats? Then there is something wrong. Usually the college will not ask you to pay any money from the organisers side as this budget is taken out from the hackathons funds. That budget guarantees free food and snacks, so unless there has been some golmal with the funds, u cannot put that money and give subpar items to the participants.\nFourthly, speak to your heads and your official professor in charge about all this budgets and stuff, and especially to VK sir, as they will help you in planning and arranging. \nFifthly, telling participants at 5am in the morning that they are disqualified is horrible planning, as if the participants want to leave after this, there is almost no reasonable transportation at this time. Something the organisers have to think about\nFinally, here is some advice as your alumni, dude this attitude which you and I see a lot of your generation has is really horrible especially in the corporate world. Cause if you show that your like this to your managers, they will fire you. These events are a time where you hone in your leadership skills and how you perform in a team, and if the event has gone like shit, then admit it and next time do better.. there is always a next time so I don't get why your resisting against criticism so much.. I'll repeat it for you, this is an opportunity for you and the club to grow and learn. Do not waste it. \nNext time, make a checklist of things you need to do. Make it known to the participants about the timings of the review,  basically from what I see, this hackathon flopped cause of the poor planning before and during the hackathon. \nI hope you will read this message in it's entirety and learn, and not take it out of context and make this an ego competition. Believe me, yall are still fledglings sheltered by pes.\nSo a short summary, learn to take criticism, learn to bow your head down when the general consensus is against you, especially in events where the participants feedback is the most important, and every opportunity is a learning opportunity, dont waste it(yes this one has been overused, but as you grow older you will realise how much meaning this one line has.) \n\nIf you have anymore questions or want advice or something, reach out, at the end of the day we are all PEST's ðŸ˜†"
