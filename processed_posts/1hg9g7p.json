My first year was filled with fests (plenty of which I was a core lead), competitions (represented PES at NIT!) and other stuff, made great friends whom I'm still in touch with (some of whom are pursuing Masters with me right now in the same uni), interacted with great profs and published good research. \n\nPES (and most colleges in our country) are what you make of it."

Our paths crossed in the most unexpected of ways, a brief encounter at a mutual friend‚Äôs gathering, where I noticed him almost immediately. There was something magnetic about the way he smiled, with an effortless warmth that drew people in. We started talking, and within minutes, it felt as though we had known each other for years. His words were gentle yet full of meaning, and I found myself drawn to the depth in his eyes, like there was an unspoken understanding between us. That first conversation was a spark, one that would eventually light up everything. It was a connection so natural, so easy, that I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder how I‚Äôd ever lived without knowing him. What started as a simple meeting blossomed into something so much more‚Äîsomething I never saw coming but couldn‚Äôt imagine living without now."
