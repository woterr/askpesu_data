I do have a decent background in Computer Science for a high school student and i dont mind on missing out on my college life and willing to work hard at it. So whats the main difference between the two branches?",

      "body": "i would take cse in bms over anything at PES. but i would take AIML in pes over CS at VIT.\n\nthere are only a handful of courses that are different between AIML and CSE till second year ( there is no third year yet). but till second year you will be learning everything the cs people do and some more. they will skip some small parts in order to fit some more ML related stuff but what they skip is pretty minor and unimportant.\n\nkeep in mind this is only till second year. third year could be very different nobody knows yet. we'll find out as we go lol"

      "body": "From whatever we know, CSE+AIML is the rebranded MIDS (Machine Intelligence and Data Science) specialisation that used to exist. For the first two years, you'll have the same syllabus as CS, but in third year the electives you choose will be strictly from ML related coursework (unlike normal CS which will get to pick from all courseworks from cybersecurity, to systems etc). \n\nMy advice? Pick CS. There are multiple reasons why\n\n1. It's an untested branch - it was introduced last year only and nobody knows how it'll turn out\n2. The profs here are too capable to teach this, they're barely qualified to teach core CS concepts\n3. You'll be restricted. What if you don't like ML? Have you thought about that situation? Taking CS will allow you to choose whatever you like, include ML related coursework if you are interested\n4. You won't get ML related jobs right out of undergrad (mostly only startups), so the advantage doesn't exist. They all require atleast an MS/PhD, which brings me to my next point -\n5. ML is a purely mathematical field with focus on calculus, probability and algebra (you need a good grasp of these). It's more of an academically oriented field than an engineering one with most people taking this only in their Postgrad than BTech so they can go into research. There is not much engineering marvel here. Unless you know what a branch is about, don't pick it.\n\nI'd be happy to answer more about AIML.on DM since I work in this field.\n\n..."

Also there will be tons of people in ec and eee who will also sit for cs placements. \n\nBMS is also more chill in general and not as academically focused as pes\n\nBut it's also not as bad as people here say and the subjects themselves are also quite easy. And pes also has better placements. \n\nSo for CSE i suppose either one is fine"

BMS offers a less academically intensive course and from what I've seen... all of my friends in BMS are living life. But if you want more exposure academically and want to build a stronger foundation... I'd say PES. CSE and AIML in PES have almost the same buzz created..... I'd suggest CSE since you can learn ML concepts side by side"

The strictness is overstated. \n\nBut attendance requirements are annoying af. 75 is too much. \n\nSomething else that gives pes an advantage is that you can make back 40 percent of your fee by being in the top 25 percent of the people. An easy way to get back like 2l out of the 4.5l fee. \n\nFor that also I'd pick pes\n\nOverall, like i said. Either way it's almost the same"
