  "content": "bhai wo lift udd nahi Jayega. I'm NOT talking about the morning rush here. but all the other times, when you're waiting for the lift at any floor and when there are people getting out, let them get our first, you can get in after that. \nAnd if everybody in the lift is getting out(usual 12th  floor scene) wait for them to get out first. Bhare hue lift ke andar kyu ghusna he tum logo ko jab pata hota he ki log bahar nikal rahe he. Why do you want to bump people. Wait for them to get out first\n\nPlease be decent. Lift won't fly away without you getting on it.\n\nIts not just once or twice. I'm writing this only after being frustrated for an entire semester",

Decency and etiquette were non-existent concepts, whether maintaining queues or waiting for your turn or letting people through. It would be great if they included etiquette, manners, and grooming as part of a class given that our alumni end up working in countries all across the globe, often as cab drivers."
