You can ask Alfadelta from EC campus (he's probably already on your batch's whatsapp group or you can easily find him on Discord). However I am not sure whom to ask about RR campus. If I remember correctly, ECE at EC is in a slightly better condition than ECE at RR.\n\nRegardless, if you are switching campuses, make sure there is a valid reason and not the \"RR>EC\" narrative."
