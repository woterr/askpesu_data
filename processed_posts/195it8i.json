The people you see with a 9+ CGPA are ones who focus on consistency as well as hard work. Semesters get gradually more difficult as you progress, your workload also increases and other commitments beyond the curriculum also come into existence. These grades now are the easiest you'll ever be able to score, make most of the time now."
