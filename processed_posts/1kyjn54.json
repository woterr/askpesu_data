      "body": "\"rigorous\" is a very relative word, and i will agree that pes relative to most other comedk colleges is a little harder with the portion. And it doesn't help that the students themselves take the exams very seriously and study quite a bit more than they should. It's cause of the scholarship, touche jawahar. \n\nBut that being said, the \"seriousness\" I'm talking about is basically studying their asses off on the exam week, not like jee, not like boards. Think like 9th.\n\nYou'll mostly be fine if you start some basic studying 1-2 weeks before the exam. Pes doesn't teach us rocket science, it's not that hard, so chill out"

I know people have have studied last minute and scored better than people who have studied for 2 days. \n\nIdeally it’s 50% understanding in class and 50% learning and practising it yourself. \n\nYes, you do get time away from academics, but only if you manage it wisely"
