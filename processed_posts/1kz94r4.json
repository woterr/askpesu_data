  "content": "Had an interview for bca mca today. They made us wait for 1~ hour then all they asked in the interview was what subjects you had in your 12th and after that they asked some python questions and sql questions. No introduction no other talk. So all prep was gone in an instant. \n\nIm confused does this actually happen or is it just a way to remove excess student applications?? \nNeed genuine answers. \n\nThanks.",

During my MCA interview, they didn‚Äôt ask anything about me ‚Äî just a few programming-related questions, and then they told me to leave the meeting room.\nBut on another day, I received a call from PES University. This time, they asked me about myself and why I wanted to join PES. Then, after about two hours, I received a message on WhatsApp saying that I had successfully cleared the entrance exam."

All I did was telling other classmates to close there video and audio as the interviewer had joined the waiting room and told them to introduce themselves but that was a mistake obviously. Could be related to that or not idk üòê"
