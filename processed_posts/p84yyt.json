      "body": "Reputation in the eyes of mentors and parents is good for a reason. Things are so unnecessarily complex here and the kind of dirty tricks the management employs to coerce us into doing what they want.\nThis management only wants placements. And you know what. The reason the placement are so good is because, they basically force you to take the first job they offer you. So if you get a job early on the placement process, and you chose to not take it to try for a higher package, you are disqualified for sitting for further placements. Once you accept a job offer, you can not sit for further placements. And mechanical electrical core placements are non existent.\nCivil branch is extinct. I don't think they are offering civil for the new batch. Biotechnology placements is zero.\nOnly CSE and ECE get it. And there too it's mostly because the college basically forces you to get the first job you are offered or get the fuck out of the placement process.\n\nThe academics are damn fucked. Management aside, there is no coordination. In between departments and even in departments. Mechanical HOD is big pain in the ass and he will make your life a living hell. Not kidding, a few faculty members have left the department since he joined in.\nThe faculty is a joke. In all departments. They are subject to heavy shit by the management and even they can't stand up to them.\nThere is literally NO SIGN OF EXTRA CURRICULAR activities. Now there are clubs but 99% are related to studies like robotics space and car building and drones. No sports. Drama club is inactive. Dance club is there for namesake, after pandemic little to no activity there. Music clubs are okay. But then no encouragement.\nOne writing club which is usually ignored even by the club members.\n\nIn the name of recreation they made a reading room on the roof of a building where you can usually find couples making out.\nHostels both boys and girls. Don't. Don't. Just don't. These guys are so dense.. Omfg. No. No.\n\nIn general, social life if you are not so out going person in nature is basically zero. People form cliques and it's hard to break into and assimilate.\nThere's way too much bull shit to fit in one comment. In essence don't even consider PESU"

      "body": "Alternatively, it is a good college if you don't already have a life, don't plan on having one, do nothing but study all the time. And aspire to get a job after engineering. Pes is a great place. You won't have a college life with friends and stuff but you will have a job at the end of it. At which you can again go on to be hard working and commit all your time to it and have nothing fun to do with all that money you get  but hey you wanted it."

      "body": "Depends on branch. Engineering is just as hard anywhere. The course is structured to fuck you in the ass. But then PESU goes out of its way to make it even more difficult. At least RVCE and BMS follow a system. VTU. And it's much more reliable.\nCampus of both are way better than pesu. All we have is a huge ass construction which makes so much noise and dust that campus life is basically breathing dirt.\nBoth of them are way better choices than PESU in terms of the life that they offer."

As a mechanical engineering final year student, I can easily very easily say CS is now universal and basic everyone should learn it irrespective of what they do. Unless you get Civil or Bio tech, you will be fine in whatever branch you get. Because come on its BITS. I imagine life there being better than any other college that you are getting. Do some research on it.\nDon't stress too much you will be done with your college before you even realise why you are there."
