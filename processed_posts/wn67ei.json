      "body": "Ohâ€¦ Thatâ€™s just sad. It kinda looks like a Win-Lose situation for both sides however it may be considered. I hope that you guys can join the college fast. PESU does not extend semester time. Itâ€™s not like VTU or any other university and they will want to finish the 1st year by the end of July, no matter what. \n\nMore delays mean less time and they will speed-run through the semesters. Us PESSAT students had 1 speedrun semester, but the KCET students had it rough, they had 2 speedrun semesters, but at least they had a ton of guilt free vacations between 12th and first semester while we wrote JEE Advanced after college started. Also, you guys will be losing out on semester holidays.  I know this is hard to hear but you guys will be back to normalcy by the end of first year while other colleges will drag it out for a year more. Itâ€™s just one year of struggle, so good luck. Donâ€™t worry, you guys wonâ€™t have it as stressful as we did. We hadnâ€™t even written KCET at this point last year. You all have a 2.5 month headstart and they dragged our counselling process too due to NEET results. I hope you all get at least a month of semester holidays. Good luck!"

      "body": "I really wish that itâ€™s a win-win for everyone. The current delays caused to you all wonâ€™t be too much of an issue. Itâ€™s nothing to be scared of. It will be either semester holidays and 29 hours of classes a week or it will be no holidays but relaxed schedule of 22-24 hours of classes a week. Also, no need to thank me. Just enjoy your vacations while you can. It is hard to get guilt free holidays when college starts as everyone will be doing courses, internship, research or whatever during the holidays and if you donâ€™t do something, you will kinda feel like youâ€™re wasting your time. Enjoy your holidays, because itâ€™s guilt free (Yes, Iâ€™m stressing guilt free again), you wonâ€™t get to relax like this. Competitive exams will have ousted you out, now itâ€™s the time to have fun and relax."
