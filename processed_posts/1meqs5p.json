      "body": "Based on how you phrased your question, I'm assuming you don't have a particular interest in either branch. RR campus has better infra than EC campus. But the branch is a deal breaker, take CSE at EC campus over ECE in RR if placements are what you care about. ECE placements are not that great in PES. Placements are anyways pooled, so campus doesn't matter for it."
