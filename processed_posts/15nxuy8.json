Yes, I did check the Google sheets document but it just stated all/most of the packages that were offered to the students and I couldn't find anything related to branchwise averages or placements in general.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes the university provide the students with any kind of statistics of some kind or another?",

      "body": "They report data in a way that best suited them.\n\nIIT Bombay probably reported across branches. \n\nPesit mentioned average only for CSE students. \n\nAlso this is average CTC. In CTC they will include every small thing for example - book reimbursement, relocation, stock options etc. \nStocks are usually vested over 4 years.\n\nAlso please do some research on how average will always be a skewed metric. \n\nFor example if there are 10 students and one of them gets 60LPA CTC and the rest got 10 LPA. The average turns out to be 15LPA and that is what will be advertised. \n\nAlways focus on the median which in my opinion would be around 10LPA at best."

They have doubled the seats now for CSE alone.\n\nWhile I agree all colleges mention CTC, my point was to point out that even CTCs can have components that you will probably never see. \n\nIn short I think 10LPA CTC is a decent estimate of what their median is"
