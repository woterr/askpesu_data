I genuinely think people there had no civic sense lol we‚Äôre all students, they had no sense of spatial awareness whatsoever. I get it, I‚Äôm not that salty to not understand that it‚Äôs expected in such audience. But I got elbowed in my chest 7 times because THEY FORMED A CIRCLE AND DANCED?? Bro it‚Äôs Mohit Chauhan you don‚Äôt have to do allatüò≠ everyone‚Äôs sweaty and swamped up here be considerate? I don‚Äôt think I caused anyone any inconvenience it‚Äôs really not that hard lol have fun and let others have fun too. Ts pmo icl.",
