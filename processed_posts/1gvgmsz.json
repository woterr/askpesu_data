  "content": "\n\nA few days ago I (20F, female woman from EC campus) was returning from classes after 5 pm.. Usually the main block is quiet and peaceful during this time. I wa waiting for the elevator to come, it came and a guy joined me in the lift. It was just me and him. \n\nIt was hot that evening and so I took off my jacket in the elevator. I saw that the guy started looking at me and I felt uncomfortable. So I started adjusting my top but the guy continued to stare at my cleavage. At that point I was scared and literally shivering. He noticed that I picked onto his creepy behaviour and so turned back on me. \n\nAs soon as I left the lift, I wore my jacket again. The guy also came out and I ignored him on the way out and luckily he didn't do anything creepy amidst the people on the ground floor. \n\n",
