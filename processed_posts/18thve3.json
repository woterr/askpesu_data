      "body": "Adding to this - \n\nTAships helps quite a bit if you're aiming for Masters. They carry a lot of weight and can also help you land TA/RAships once you're there. Some applications even specifically ask if you have prior experience. Plus the working history with a prof will get you significantly stronger LORs (provided you do good work ofc). A TAship might not help you too much in getting a job though. IMO, taking up a TA role in a course you're interested in and relevant to your future career interests and what you want to pursue for MS will significantly help make you a better candidate. \n\nAnd finally, don't take up a TA role for the sake of the paycheck. There are a lot of other benefits which matter more.\n\nI was a TA back in my 7th sem, if you have any questions I'd be happy to answer."
