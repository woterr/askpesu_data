On there website it was written that 11th and 12th class cbse questions will come so I assumed tht a little bit of high level might come but idk. I tried copying from my neighbor as he said he scores 95 percentile but thn he started hiding his screen lol I don't blame him. But basically I tbh don't know wht to say I was about to cry in the middle of the exam because I studied more thn 12 hours everyday too. I'm sorry I don't want any consolation but idk wht to do so thts y I'm writing this considering the fact tht pes was my last option. ",
