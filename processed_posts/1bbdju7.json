Being from Karnataka and belonging to the EWS category, I might get admission in NIT Surathkal for civil engineering. Is this a good choice, or should I focus on performing well in KCET to get a seat in PESU (computer science) ?  I also want to mention that getting into PESU for CS isn't challenging for me, considering I also qualify for  GMR ( General merit rural) \n\nPlz help... ",
