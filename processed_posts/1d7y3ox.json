Bio inspired computing\n\n3. cryptography                                        3. computer network security \n\n\n\n1.I am looking for a scoring E1, so is AR-VR scoring\n\n2.Does specialisation matter?\n\n3.I'm more inclined towards AR-VR+Big Data (going by \"interests\")  is that a good combination or is DA+BD is considered a good combination ?\n\n4. Is data analytics math intensive? ",
