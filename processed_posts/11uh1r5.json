Companies start coming at the end of July, credits/grade for summer internship and summer courses only get applied at the end of the next semester, so end of 7th semester. I could be wrong, but for my batch that's when it was counted in.\n\nAs for your CGPA affecting your placements, you should be eligible for atleast 75-80% of companies' placement tests. So yes, you will be able to sit for most of them. However, getting shortlisted after clearing the test is a different question altogether since a lot of factors are considered, including your CGPA."

You will not get it as early as the people who have higher CGPAs but don't stress, don't lose hope and keep working on your competitive coding. Most of my friends who had CGPA around 8.8+ got a T1 job before 15th August(placements started around 25th July), and those who had CGPA around 8 got by mid September."
