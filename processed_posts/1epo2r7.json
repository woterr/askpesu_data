  "content": "I want a senior to clarify what you mean when you say that 'PES is very strict and theres no college life' ?\n\nAs far as I've seen , (at least in RR campus) : The infrastructure , fests , clubs , crowd and sports facilities seemed decent. What do you mean by 'strict'? Hostels seem chill too, I know the rules are very strict but they aren't really enforced past sem1 anyway.\n\nIf you mean to say academics is tough, I don't see how that has anything to do with the college being strict.  I have friends who're in 3rd year with 9+ cgpa that say that it's not too hard if you study regularly like you would in any other college.\n\n\n\nTLDR: What makes PES 'stricter' than other colleges . \n\n  \n( made an account just now to ask this on reddit )",

Dress code, ID card, no bunking/loitering, etc. EC campus is comparatively chill (or at least was, during my time)\n\nAcademically RR is tougher and more competitive simply because the higher ranking students go there. It's strict in the sense that the faculty there are stricter about the rules and deadlines."
