And if you're skilled enough there are chances you get a great off campus placement. Whatever college you join, give your best man. Not getting in to pes won't hinder your career progress, it might just delay it. But wherever you join, you should keep learning. Study, upskill, network, have fun and fuck around. You'll get where you want to be"

      "body": "GPA is useless after you make it to the interview rounds. If you do not have any industry ready skills, projects, experiences etc to show that you are a valuable hire to a company, why would they take you? You need to show that you are hireable and can work for the company for the given role they are recruiting. If you have only a GPA and nothing else on your profile, they know that you won't be able to contribute anything productively and hence you'll be the first to be eliminated during interviews. \n\nUsually it's the people who have a strong profile with a moderately high GPA and a good background in the skills the company needs with quality projects and experiences who get placed first. Not to generalise, but most GPA grinders often do not put any emphasis on building their overall profile (because they sacrifice time for GPA) and that's all they have to show, which is why they struggle during interviews. \n\nThere are more details in the FAQs about placements, check those links."

If you have less gpa you should prove that by building your resume with projects and skills also just by joining pes it won't guarantee you a job . You should focus on yourself and if you have skills definitely you will get good job even if you don't get from placement definitely you will get from offcampus don't worry just focus on yourself and it doesn't matter whichever college you get don't forget to maintain good gpa with relevant skills . All the best üëç"
