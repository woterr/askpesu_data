Difficult subjects in 3rd sem would be **Analog Circuit Design**, **Mathematics for Electronics Engineers.** \n\nb. I didn't get what you mean by cutoff for MRD??\n\nc. You can, but usually teachers announce you (students) about it only by 4th sem. FYI, This question has been answered in the FAQ already"
