      "body": "Pretty similar. RR has a bigger budget so fests tend to be better here but the club culture (especially for tech) is significantly better at EC. \n\nHonestly, given that you have different branches at each campus, I'd suggest you to choose based on branch preference and not based on factors like clubs/college life because these things are inconsequential after 3rd year (and usually, even a bit before 3rd year ends). Your branch on the other hand determines a lot of career outcomes down the line."
