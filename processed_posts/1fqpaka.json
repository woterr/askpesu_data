Think of it as a smaller version of the actual UN bodies eg: UNHRC,UNSC , DISEC etc. \nYou get to choose to represent a particular country and you get to talk and formulate and discuss global issues that interest you. \nI attended PeCon last year and I absolutely loved that experience, do try it! You get to meet a lot of people and it will be a new experience"
