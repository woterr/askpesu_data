      "body": "It's not got to do with placements, rather the 3rd year of your degree. Instead of core CS which will get to pick among different fields to specialise, that choice has already been taken for you so you'll never get to pick. If it turns out you don't like the field, you'll end up with a specialised degree which you don't want forever. This will hurt your chances later when you try to switch to a different field."
