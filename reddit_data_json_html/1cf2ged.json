    "how many did u attempted bro with all the guess work?? and yes there is a high chance of getting cs at this percentile\n└── I attempted 167 but I didn't really try to hard, there are a ton of guesses involved I'd say and how did you come to the conclusion that there's a decent chance?\n    ├── because my cousin is a pes alumuni i asked him he said if u go personally they will take admission since 97 is a good no.  by the way what does a ton mean to u 50-60?? or 40??\n    └── and acc to me plzz consider lnmiit jaipur . its better\n        └── thank you for the suggestion"
