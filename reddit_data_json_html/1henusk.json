Our chem ma'am said every question's e part has questions from lab expts so I'm asking in other subjects is there any pattern like that ?",

    "you'll have 4 subdivisions   \neach unit is 1 subdivision 25 marks each  \neach subdivision will have 4-5 questions  \nand concerning the lab component it was only chem lab component for us\n├── Ya ofc lab component is only for Chem but is it 1st subdivision is unit 1 only n 2nd is unit 2 like that . I get very confused in math like which to method to do... so I wanna know this .\n│   ├── Yep, you'll have questions of the format:\n\n1a  \n1b  \n1c  \n1d  \n1e  \n  \n2a  \n2b  \n2c  \n2d  \nand so on... \n\nThere will be 4 parts, (i.e., until 4e)\n\nQuestions from the 1 series are from unit 1, 2 series from unit 2 and so on.   \nOne unit can have a maximum of 5 questions (a,b,c,d,e). The minimum is up to the paper setter, but it's usually between 3 to 4.\n│   │   ├── One thing you forgot to add: all questions are mandatory. You don't get any choice/options\n│   │   └── Perfect... The explanation I needed FR\n│   └── yes each subdivision is 1 unit\n└── Will they ask questions from any of the 10 exp in chem or only selected experiements? Only like 4 experiments are related to what we are learning in unit 1 to 4... so will they ask from these 4 only or all 10?"
