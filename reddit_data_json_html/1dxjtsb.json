    "WT and DSA are coding-based subjects. You should be thorough with all the codes and implementations as they ask for codes in ISAs and ESAs.\n\nDDCO, AFLL, and SDS require practice as they are very logical and mathematical subjects. For SDS, doing classwork problems is a must because many questions were the same in the ISA, at least last year.",
    "Study the day before.\nBut also listen to class."
