    "bruh try to change from ece to cse within ec campus itself if you are keen on placements",
    "I think its best to ask an ECE seniors/alumni from both campuses. You can ask Alfadelta from EC campus (he's probably already on your batch's whatsapp group or you can easily find him on Discord). However I am not sure whom to ask about RR campus. If I remember correctly, ECE at EC is in a slightly better condition than ECE at RR.\n\nRegardless, if you are switching campuses, make sure there is a valid reason and not the \"RR&gt;EC\" narrative.\nâ””â”€â”€ Thanks a lot !!do lmk if u know anyone else i can contact\n    â””â”€â”€ You can always find more seniors or alumni on LinkedIn.",

    "Bro respectfully you ain't gonna get it unless it's 9+\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Last year the cutoff was close to 7\nâ””â”€â”€ Yeah I knew that but I just wanted to know if there's any difference at all?\n    â”œâ”€â”€ Also fam unrelated but never make your reddit username your actual nameðŸ˜­\n    â””â”€â”€ Nope , just campus locations diff , don't know much about ece profs in rr branch."
