    "No cutoffs just they call everyone who applied for change to rr campus and hold another bidding session highest GPA first. One guy will sit there on excel maintaining the live count of seats. Im 2027 Batch for us rr cse was 9.6 cutoff around.\n\nFor more details just search a lil there are many people for have asked about this.\n├── How do you apply?\n│   └── They'll open a form on the website and will inform you that it is open. Usually happens a week after 3rd sem starts\n│       └── Thanks sm!\n└── do you know what the cutoff was for ai ml?\n    └── I dont remember exactly but rr aiml was lower than ec cse which was cutoff at 8.8 or 8.6. ec aiml went way lower"
