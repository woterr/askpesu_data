    "All summer courses take place over one week (5 days). ISAs and ESA are held within those days. At most, you can take 2 non-overlapping summer courses. They're worth it if you're looking to either learn something new or you want to use a summer course to replace an existing special topic you didn't do well in. Other than these two reasons, there isn't much value to them",
    "Cfbr, btw 2500 for 1 credit is expensive",
    "I didnâ€™t take a special topic in 3rd sem is it compulsory for me to take a summer course ."
