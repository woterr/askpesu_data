  "content": "Till now, the grading system for Semesters 1 and 2 has been percentage-based (e.g., above 90% = S grade, above 80% = A grade, etc.). I wanted to know whether the same system will continue for the coming three years, or will it be changed to a percentile-based system?\n\nWill there be a diff in grading system of both branches ??\n\n",

    "The same grading system applies across branches.\n└── Adding to this, even though the subjects are same for both branches, and have same grading systems, the question papers are different and evaluation is done separately. So just bcoz aiml had relative grading for some subject doesn't mean cse guys also will, and vice versa."
