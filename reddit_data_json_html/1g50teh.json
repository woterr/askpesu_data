    "\"We have well developed AI tools which can ease the correction process reducing the time taken and increasing the efficiency\" - Ended up taking 15+ days for just correcting internal papers of CSE students\n└── When natural intelligence of profs wasn't enough so they opt for artificial intelligence\n    └── R/rareinsults\n        └── r/foundthemobileuser",
    "No way AI can read my handwriting. I write in a legibility that's outside its plane of existence.\n└── I myself find it difficult to backtrack and look for calculation mistakes 🌚",
    "We don't *think about it*, we *are* IIT BLR.",
    "I am waiting for the Indian government to finally give the IIT tag to PES\n└── Or maybe PES tag to all the IITs 🌚\n    └── 😂",
    "The usual school good handwriting all nighter topper will remain topper lol\n└── Aren't your ISAa a CBT?\n    └── I assumed this post was for handwritten exams. Why else would someone have a problem with ai 🤷🏻‍♀️\n        └── No but even the written questions are typed out on the CBT right?\n            ├── We can either type them out into the computer or write them on paper.\n            ├── They made it hybrid now \n\n4m - written on paper/pc; 2m and 1m mcqs to be marked in pc\n            ├── It's hybrid. I always write as sometimes the keyboard sucks.\n            └── Not necessarily, there are problems which you can't type out right? for  those you have to paper some or the other how....",
    "Its fine only na , I felt everyone scored good only pa.\n├── wdym by good. the averages are pretty low\n│   └── Exactly!!!! That means there'll be relative grading  this time........\n│       └── They didn't do it in 2nd sem so we can't expect anything\n└── are they actually correcting them with ai or just aiding profs?\n    └── Apparently some prof said that the AI is giving less marks even for the answers which were correct itseems..... and what I feel personally is they might've just passed the marks like that only without checking anything and the 15 days buffer was to just train the model again and again....."
