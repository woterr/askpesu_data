  "content": "\nSo apparently Union Bank’s business model is cut money first, ask questions never. They straight up yanked 700 bucks from my account in one week just for not maintaining a \"minimum balance\". like sorry I’m not rolling in lakhs, my bad for being a student?\n\nThen when I do have money and dare to spend it (on the absolute luxuries of shared auto and bmtc), they go full detective mode and suspend the account for \"irregular activity.\" I went to ask what the hell was going on, and the lady at the desk hits me with, “You’re unemployed / student, so how are you spending so much money?”\n\nMa’am, what do you think? I’m running a money laundering ring between classes? Should I start filing an ITR every time I buy a plate of dosa?\n\nAbsolute clownery. Thanks for punishing me for being broke and alive.",
