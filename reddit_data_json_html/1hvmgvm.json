    "OOAD - best to ask someone in 4th year. The syllabus tends to change often. \n\nCC - straightforward course, not too much effort if you like the concepts from beforehand. Can be theoretical at times with a good chunk of memorization (about 50%). But overall a good course. \n\nCompiler - Full PTSD my dude. Unless you're someone with a niche interest in how compilers are designed, you are going to hate this course with every breath in your body. The course is not only challenging but it's also very tedious, not straightforward to grasp, complex, has a very steep learning curve, difficult to learn since a lot of it cannot be visualised or seen in everyday life, and a massive pain in the ass. Add in the fact that PESU profs here cannot reach this course. The assignments/project will have you design a sample compiler for a known language. Even that is pain. The only saving grace is Preet and her recorded lectures. She explains the concepts really well and her lectures are like the Bible. Watch them and re-watch them until you are fundamentally clear with the entire video and you can do the same steps she is doing in them without reference.\n└── thank you"
