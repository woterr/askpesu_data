  "content": "I have joined PES RR this year, the internet captive portal only lets us login once (sometimes 2-3 times if we r lucky) in a day.\n\n  \nSO everytime I close my laptop or move to a different block it disconnects and asks for login. When I login it says that \"Max login limit reached'\n\n  \nWhat is the solution for this?",

    "Just logout from the portal when your switching between devices or networks",
    "One would think they would've fixed this with the number of CS graduates coming out of there every year. It's been 5 years since I graduated.",
    "I usually login through my phone and keep the wifi on the entire day. Share it to laptop through hotspot. When you go out of the building, turn on the data but don't switch off the wifi. It will connect automatically without asking for another login",
    "Ikr. I could only login once before they blocked me out."
