    "you can ask the reception in any floor (if you've lost it in BE block) where the lost and found is and they'll tell you to ask one of the cleaner aunties in that floor. they're very helpful and you will usually get your stuff back.\nâ””â”€â”€ The aunties were very nice about it in fact she asks me everyday now if I found it, OAT was the last I saw the pouch tho\nThanks for the help tho :)",
