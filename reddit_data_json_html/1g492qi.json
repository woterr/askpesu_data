  "content": "So, for the past week, I've noticed something mind-blowing on my commute to the Electronic City campus—buses stopping right at the college entrance. I’m talking precision-level bus halts. Like, “Am I in a VIP zone?” type of situation.\n\nBut wait, it gets crazier. Today, I heard the bus speaker and saw the board actually announce PES College as a stop! Right after Hosa Road Junction! 😱\n\nI mean… can this be real life? Has PES reached \"official bus stop\" status now? If so, forget being IIT Bangalore; we’re CalTech Bangalore branch!",
