  "title": "[Question] Is an M1 or M2 Macbook(no longer sold on the official website) worth it right now?",
  "content": "Got asked this question from a relative of mine who is joining PES this year. (I just graduated this year) Both M1 and M2 macs are being sold at pretty reasonable prices through Reliance Digital and other such websites, although it's no longer on the Apple website. I personally bought a gaming laptop during my time at PES, so I have almost no knowledge about this topic and thought it would be a good idea to ask. Thanks in advance!",

    " M4 will be a better choice as it comes in similar pricing. The m1/m2 have 8gb base ram iirc which is not enough.so they need to get 16gb(apple robs u when u upgrade to higher soecs). Also m4 was released at a lower price with 16gb ram as base. If getting mac get the m4 u can get  it for 78k(student+cc+bargaining)(base model with 16 ram).\nThe price diff for 16 gigs is max 2 to 3k bw m2 and m4.\nNo point in getting m1 and m2",
    "No.  \ni brought an M2 Air, 2 years ago. you get M4 at the same price now."
