    "Any idea on what could be the cutoff??\n├── no idea bro\n└── No idea man.I've 5.9 k in KCET.I've joined MIT Manipal but PESU is convenient to me as it's near metro and it's apparently one of the top colleges in Bangalore,but the guy in charge of this, said that as it is the first time they're conducting this, there is no guarantee of any seat, but he also added that I've a small chance of RR CSE or ECE.So everything will only be clear on counselling day.They did upload a chart saying that 288 seats were available in CSE but it was removed soon after. However making an assumption that under 5k rankers will mostly not report,Ig there is a chance of getting seat in counselling even for lower rankers so just wait until 8th August.They said that the seat matrix would come on the 8th of August.",
    "how many seats are there btw for cse?\n└── No one knows mate"
