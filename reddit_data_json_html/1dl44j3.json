  "content": "Hey Guys\nI'm working on some research projects which can use a few more hands, and instead of going through hundreds of application online I wanted to check if any of my juniors are interested in these projects (PESU is a good proxy for quality filter)\n\n\nThere are 2 position for a immediate project, if you know and have worked with LLMs for information retrieval (web,pdf) can let me know, it's a short term (2-3 months)paid position. This is only for those who have a portfolio to show with LLM experience.\n\n[Update: The above position is filled, thank you for your applications]\n\nCan send applications directly to :  a.kumarjha@deakin[dot]edu[dot]au (attached resume if you have one)\n\n\nSecondly, there are three long term projects (6 months +) and are open for those who are willing to learn and apply advance AI techniques (LLM and LVMs). Perks are not too much there but you'll have all resources for free, funds to attend conferences (domestic sure, International depends on project stage) and promotion to full time internship on some funded projects if you gain the skills in time. For this pre-requisite: Python. \n\n\n\nI m worked with 5 students (3EC + 2RR) and have good experience working remotely with them. You can ask query in comment (preferred) or DM\n\n\nAdmin can DM to verify the information.\nSorry if it's not appropriate for this sub reddit.\n\nEnjoy your Breaks.\n  ",
