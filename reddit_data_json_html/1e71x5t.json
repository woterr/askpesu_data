    "wait what inauguration?\n└── It's for non BTech students at RR on July 21st\n    └── Oh I didn't know that either...Nice",
    "Better if u come, they brief everything about college rules and syllabus and stuff. Although not compulsory imo. \n└── I see, will consider but also it's quite a distance to travel on a day my father's busy..",
    "these people throw around the word mandatory like their life depends on it. it is quite helpful though if you attend, helps you understand the system\n└── Okay 👍, and whats the 5 day bootstrap programme after?\n    └── just fun lil activities that'll help you socialize and make some friends. its quite nice, you should attend.\n        └── Oh okayy thank you!",
