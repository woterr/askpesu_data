  "content": "Hi,\nIâ€™m planning to join an MCA program in Bangalore by the end of this month. Iâ€™m looking for options within a budget (through management quota).\n\nIâ€™ve come across PES University and understand itâ€™s a well-known college. But I also heard from some students that while the environment is strict and focused, MCA placements are very limited, with only 10â€“20% of students placed (e.g., ~30 out of 300), which seems quite low compared to the image the college has online.\n\nSo Iâ€™d really appreciate some clarity on this â€”\n\tâ€¢\tIs it true that MCA placements at PES are poor or only for top students?\n\tâ€¢\tIs PES still worth it in terms of teaching quality, syllabus, and long-term growth?\n\tâ€¢\tOr should I consider alternatives like DSCE, BMS, or others where MCA students might have better balance of cost and opportunity?\n\n\nDsce quoted me 8.03pac total management seat so \n\nWould love to hear your genuine advice on this â€” I want to make the right investment based on real outcomes, not just college branding.\n\nThanks!\n",
