    "First of all they are not electives, they are called special topics, you’ll have electives from your 3rd year which will comprise of 4 credits per elective.\nSecondly, afaik cie is a mandatory course for sem3&amp;4.\nSpecial topics is not mandatory but it’s good if you do it to earn the rest of the remainder credits.\nPlease refer to FAQ’s for a better clarity on this.",
    "In 4th sem CIE L2 will be there",
    "Electives will remain as electives only, there will be no change in that"
