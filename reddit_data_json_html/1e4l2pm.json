    "I don't know about the hostel or RR campus but you get around 100 Mbps (bits, not bytes) on wifi and around 300 Mbps over LAN when you use student IDs on the wifi captive portal. I have heard it's faster for teachers and even faster if you use captive login IDs assigned by the research labs. I cannot vouch for that but the speeds I mentioned are what you can expect on a day to day basis.",
