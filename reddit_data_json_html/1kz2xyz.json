  "content": "Hey everyone!  \nI'm likely joining BTech Biotech at PES and aiming to build a strong profile for MS abroad. I wanted to ask a few things from seniors or anyone in the loop:\n\n1. Does PES support students going for research internships like IAS, JNCASR, DAAD WISE, etc.?\n2. How flexible is it if I want to work on external research/projects?\n3. Is it hard to maintain 8.5+ CGPA here?\n4. Any biotech-specific exchange/summer programs that are worth aiming for?\n5. Do profs support students doing research outside class?\n\nTrying to plan my next few years right — would really appreciate any input 🙏",

    "you better hope atleast one of the 6 biotech students in this sub respond\n└── ur being over-optimistic with 6..",
    "I'd suggest posting this on the discord server. There are a few current students who are active and from biotech.",
    "I graduated from PES Biotech 2 years ago, so I’m not sure how the situation has changed now but I can help with the answers. \n\n1 &amp; 5. When I was a student, the teachers were very supportive about the research internships you mentioned and if you also wanted to work under them in college. I would reach out to them from your 4th semester because most teachers expect you to know what’s taught in the 3rd semester before you can start your own research.\n\n2. I don’t know what you mean by external research but if you want to work under a different prof outside PES, you can do so in your own time.\n\n3. No\n\n4. Look at IIT and IISER’s summer internships.\n└── Oh ok Thanks a lot, research internships was a point of concern for me..\n    └── The profs I had were really supportive and would help as much as they could. The only hurdle would be the administration if the timeline of internship clashes with exams and such. \n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!\n        └── Thanks so much clears lot of my doubts looking ahead for PES !!",
    "Not a BioTech BTech but Prof outside so I'll give it a try,\nBioTech is new in PES so I doubt there are many who will crack the scholarship you mentioned. Your competitors are good and connected sitting in JNUs, IITs, IISERs and not to say anything bad but research support is dwindling at best at PESU.\n\nExternal works of course if you can get and manage.\n\nNo idea of high GPA but do keep 8+ if you want a scholarship.\n\nApplying for the summer internship after working with your profs might get a shot\n\nFinally profs support anything till you get a Scopus cause that's incentives 🫣, but be careful cause a retraction will kill your application abroad forever so ethically do the best you can.\n└── Hey thanks for such valuable information. \n\nDo you mind if I can message you about some specifics ?\n    └── Sure🙌"
