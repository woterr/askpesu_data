    "Yo can call the warden and enquire yourself\nâ””â”€â”€ kinda lazy to do that, I just thought someone might know if it's filled or not\n    â””â”€â”€ Bruh it's your accommodation. Get off your lazy ass and be more proactive. You're not going to be spoonfed at 18 years of age.\n        â””â”€â”€ i knew i was going to get scolded by you, so sorryðŸ˜­, will do it",
