    "This year syllabus is new.  \nBut looking at the syllabus i can see some topics which can come :  \n1) HTTP status codes and their names , Difference between GET,POST,PUT,DELETE requests.  \n2) Css selectors.  \n3) javascript - const,var,let difference .  \n4) Hoisting and var scope (comes almost every time).  \n5) callback vs promises vs async/await (dealing with callback hell)  \n6) Http form submission   \n7) Stateful vs stateless components in React.  \n8) React Styling - inline styling , import css file etc\n└── Lmao why dont they teach Angular in PES?\n    └── React is fine i think , they have added nextJs as well this year.\n        └── Best, thats cool !!",
