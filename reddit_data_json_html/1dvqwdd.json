    "Most companies would have visited by the end of 7th sem, or at most January in 8th sem. This is because spring internships start in January. The number of companies greatly reduces from Feb onward and the season ends around May/June.\n└── tier 3 companies as well?\n    └── There is no fixed order of companies that visit. It does not follow T1 and then T2 and then T3 and so on. The order is random and it changes every year so it is not really possible to predict. However, it *is* established that *most* T1 and T2 companies visit before January.\n        └── Thanks a lot for this information!",
