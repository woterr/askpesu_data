    "&gt;how do I cope with this?\n\nAttend classes that's it.\n\nAnd the lab doesn't have 100 percent attendance criteria\n└── bro is the lab thing real?? i am freaking out as i cannot attend due to unavoidable circumstances :(\n    ├── Yeah, just keep everything above 75 and u'll be fine\n    └── For our physics lab we had like 3 marks for attendance, as long as you haven’t missed more than 2 classes you should be fine\n        └── What's the total number of physics lab classes?\n            └── Around 11 to 12 classes of 3 slots each but varies as each section have lab on a different day and some of those days will be holidays. Check Callander of events and count the days your section has lab\n                └── Ok tysm",
