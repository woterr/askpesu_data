I've been in this department for quite some time now and I haven't found a single piece of information about my seniors, placed/unplaced.",

    "Core jobs in non IT fields are reducing day by day, and a lot of non IT core engineers are switching to IT. The ones who do get into non IT core are less in numbers and probably don't talk about it, hence less conversations around it\n\nBut yes, there are decent core non IT placements in PES (as compared to market)",
    "If you have the time, just go visit the placements office in RR campus once and talk to Somshekar sir. You'll know things usually are. EEE and mech students can sit for a few of the same companies that ECE students also sit for but most of them don't actually get placed. You can just see the statistics if you go talk to someone in the placements office"
