    "Every department's top x% (x=20 for my batch, might have changed now) gets 40% of their fees back.  There is no way to say \"how much\" you need to score, since it depends on how the batch performs. If you are in CS, then usually crossing an 8.8 is enough to guarantee this scholarship. \n\nThere is another scholarship where branch toppers with the highest CGPA get more returns, but I have forgotten the %. So maybe someone else can fill in here.\nâ””â”€â”€ The top 5% gets MRD which is 50% of your fees back, the next 20% gets CNR which is 40% of your fees back. And then there's DAC, everybody above 7.75 SGPA gets 1000 rupees.\nI'm in 2nd sem physics cycle now, the cut-off for CNR for 1st sem chem cycle was 8.7 i believe.\n    â”œâ”€â”€ DAC gets 2k now\n    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Ah alright, didn't know that\n    â”œâ”€â”€ Isn't it top 5 and then next 20\n\nI'm 100% sure 10 percent of us didn't getrd\n    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Thanks for that, I asked a friend who got mrd, it's 5%, editing my comment now.\n    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Aww fuck. I was happy for a second there\n    â”‚           â””â”€â”€ Happiness was never an option, it's ESA time in 4 days for 2nd sem pessants ðŸ’€\n    â””â”€â”€ It's 50 percent on the tution fee.. Btech fee is nearly 5 lakh so by this logic will get back 2.5 lakh. Am I right?"
