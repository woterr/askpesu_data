    "yes, you can but then again I don't know which course you belong to, so the worksheets, case studies + research marks will help you cover up ( according to my course). ESA matters the most really. But yeah chill, do well in ISA 2 and ESA.\n└──  I'm from CSE\n    └── Yeah no clue about that. But from my general knowledge, projects ( or whatever internals you guys have through which you obtain marks) + ISA 2 and ESA will help you out.\n        └── Okay thanks",
    "Yeah, you can still get 8 if you get good marks in your isa 2 and ESA. Esa isworth 50 marks and your assignments are usually 10-20 marks. Only half of the remaining marks are your ISA 1 so if you grind for the rest of the sem it'll ne possible go get above 8 dw"
