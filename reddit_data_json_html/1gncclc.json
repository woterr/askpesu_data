    "Got an S grade in Mechanical by focusing on the numericals and understanding the logic. Theory part is kinda boring, but it’s easy marks if you know it.\n└── Yea dude , I can solve almost all numericals with correct logic though . Theory part as you said is easy",
    "Depends which subject you’re referring to. Manufacturing subjects slides are enough. Thermal and some design subjects requires you to have a good understanding of the concept and plenty of practice. Use the prescribed text books\n└── Thank you :)",
    "Yeah it's enough , just study the slides , and do the numericals on the pesu academy\n└── Thanks GG"
