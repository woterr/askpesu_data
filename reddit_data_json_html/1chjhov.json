    "I'd say if you're interested in DevOps, look out for internships from this year itself, for summer openings come and go so fast. Alongside campus placement you need to put in efforts off campus too, which is usually better than on campus. For me I started applying around Dec 2021 during my 5th semester end and the whole hiring process took 6 months. So build connections on LinkedIn and look for internships in Start-ups."
