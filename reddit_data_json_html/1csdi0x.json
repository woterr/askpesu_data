    "Chill out man there's always another chance. I have a friend who had a back in ACD and he cleared it within a year. It will defo bring your grade back up.\n\nJust take the extra time to study the subject better that's all",
    "How severely is it going to affect me ? \nI have a cgpa of 8.4 \nPlease don't sugar coat things based on the recent events. \nI have told my parents already and they are ok with what happens\n└── It won't severely affect you. You can clear it when backlog exams take place.\n    └── I have 1 doubt \nFor backlog esa its only the esa component but is there a max grade limit ? Or if I get 90+ in esa will I get S\n        ├── If I remember correctly, there is a maximum grade limit. I don't remember which grade that is. Best to get it verified.\n        │   └── Don't spread bullshit everytime about maximum cap , there is no max cap for backlog people even got S grade\n        │       └── Well there *used* to be a cap and it was a B grade for my batch. That's why I also suggested looking into the policy now. Policies change from year to year and it's not always possible for one person to know if something has changed. That's why this subreddit exists so everyone can contribute.\n\nNext time instead of attacking me you can contribute productively by helping the person who asked.\n        └── I think it's possible to get an s in backlogs",
    "I missed one exam like this in first sem I got an S grade later don't worry it'll be alright\n└── That's good to know",
