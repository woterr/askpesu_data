    "Pes gives 40% to 50% of tuition fees back to the students who qualify for the cnr and mrd scholarships so that only well deserving students can cover their education in almost half the cost\n(Get cgpa above cutoff and u too will get half of the fees you paid back to ur account)\n└── Bruh if u feel that pes fees is that high try getting into tier 2 or 3 Engineering colleges.\nOr maybe try joining a college through ur kcet or jee score🙂\n    └── PES itself is bare tier 2 (although tier system is weird). Honestly such high fees is only justified for BITS, not an \"only karnataka people know about\" college. \n\nAlso I am not eligible for KCET and only getting BMSCE CSE through comedk. So ig PES is the only option left 😭. \n\nHow hard is it to score above cutoff cgpa for scholarships ?\n        ├── The fact that you chose PES over BMS justifies the high fee lol\n        │   └── Uhm, it doesn't. But ok, it is what it is.\n        │       └── It does prove that there are people willing to pay that much more for comparable colleges. So yes, they can absolutely increase the fees because they know people like you exist. That's their justification.\n        │           └── That's a flawed justification. Just because people are willing to pay doesn't mean the price is fair. It's exploitation wrapped in brand perception. If PES wants to charge high fees, it better start to offer things outside placements as well, not just betting on FOMO and blind demand.\n        │               └── You're forgetting that PES doesn't have to make the price fair, nor does it care about what people think about the cost. As long as people like you and me are willing to pay the fees to join, to them the cost is justified because it brings in the money. Nobody here claims that you're getting what you're paying for. It's very, very far from that. It's a very simple business. As long as they have customers increasing every year, the price is right.\n        │                   ├── Very true... at the end of the day, PES is like any other business looking to maximise profit..\n        │                   └── Yeah right.

You can't justify the pesu fees end of story as the other comment said.\n            └── Karnataka has NITK, IIITB, IISc, IIT Dharwad bruh. Seriously you are naive to consider it Tier 1. What tier do IITs, NITs fall in then ? College is more than just placements. BITS give you far more exposure, good industry connections, LORs from their would be weighted more, far better college life, all merit students from a competitive exam, better placements.\n\nPES is no where. Although for CET, I could say its the best choice. Still I don't see how the fees is justified.\n\nJust a decent infrastructure and everyone gets crazy about it.

    "ever heard of supply and demand?\n└── Whole India doesn't cry for PES sir. But whatever, ig demand must be high, hence the crazy intake,\n    └── Why dawg, didn’t get seat anywhere else?\n        └── ofc everyone will get seat somewhere else, that somewhere else being some tier 69 college.",
    "LMAO i swear, I never understood why PES has an annual fees of 5 lakhs (through mains), when it has neither the reputation of BITS nor the campus life of Manipal, these peeps be asking 5 lakhs for the sake of it\n└── Ikr, And on top of that, some seniors got so offended 😭",
    "Placements are as good as rvce cse/manipal main campus cse IF AND ONLY IF you're a deserving student (and its half the fees too cus pes gives scholarships) so its very worth it, if you're competent that is. If you aren't, better to go to a cheaper college with lesser opportunities\n└── There's a world outside placements as well and surely I will put in efforts for the scholarships.\n    └── The thing is, in a country like India, very few care beyond the placements. A lot of guys who screwed jee but are upper middle class (not rich, theres a diff) would likely look at colleges like pes just for the placements. Believe it or not, the manipal campus life aint the priority for majority of the students if the placements are almost the same. Hence the hike in fees",
    "Its not if from kcet",
    "They are not that high if u get 50 lpa pkg like me 😎",
