    "&gt;as a 2nd year student, I have no idea\n\nLove that you still have great expectations from this place even after 4 semesters here. Keep it up &lt;3\n\nYou know what they say: &gt;!PES disappointing you once is on them. PES disappointing you twice is on you.!&lt;\n└── They did show the world cup final last time, so I had hope😢",
    "Oh yeah, PESU totally cares about your cricket cravings. Next, they'll serve popcorn and let you skip classes too, right? \n\nBro, they can't even manage a working projector without it crashing harder than your GPA. Just stream it on your phone like a normal person—wait, do you even have data or did PESU suck that out of y—\n└── sorry, the pesu hostel wifi crashed as i was writing that comment because of course it did",
    "No macha, they'll send us back in a straight line if we ask them to do it.\n\n(It's lowkey wild that after almost two years, you still haven't grasped how things work here.💀🙏🏼)",
    "why would they",
    "They only did it for 2023 wc final in ec campus. And we have isa on Monday so no chance \n└── *We got it done.\n\nThaksha, Harsh, and a few others (including me) campaigned quite hard to get it done :)\n    └── Oh, it was awesome, the place was absolutely electric at 47-3 but it all ended in disappointment \n        └── Ye. The ending was sad",
    "If you're hosteller and your mess has a tv, thats the only option available. Thats how my friends saw world cup in 2023 . But if you think pesu will screen it then no buddy💀",
    "nigga dont you have isa :(\n├── As a wise man once said \"If I have studied for ISA then watching the match for 1 day doesn't matter and even if I haven't studied then this 1 day doesn't matter\"\n│   └── PES Academics summarized in a sentence... well said \n└── Where did you get that flair?\n    └── This flair was there some time ago(I have had it for 2 years) , but the mods have removed it now. (ig) 😞\n        └── Uhm recession ig, flair layoff. 😞\n            └── for real dude :(\n                └── We removed branch flairs because we felt having year related flairs was more relevant and provided more information on how to answer questions since the branch can almost always be inferred from the post content."
