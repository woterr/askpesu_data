  "content": "Hey Seniors, I'm joining PES this year and am kind of fed up with the wait for college to start and have a lot of free time in my hands which I feel like putting into good use. So I just wanted to know what are some things that you regret not knowing before joining or is there anything from 11th and 12th that I should be revising so that I won't have trouble getting back to academics after such a long break, or should I just continue to enjoy the break because the college will take \"good care\" of me later",

    "Ig you can revise Integration and Differentiation cuz Mathematics 1 and 2 in 1st and 2nd sem are related to it. Other than that there is no need to revise 11th and 12th its pretty much a fresh start from 0 (or an easy pickup) for the rest of the courses\n└── Peace ✌️",
    "Brother I know the wait is annoying but meanwhile start doing python coz that'll be in sem 1 and most the teachers don't teach that well\n├── Should I just do the basics as in what they teach in IP(11th and 12th) or go a bit deeper?\n│   ├── What's ip ? Do cs50 ig\n│   ├── IP gets your java basics you will have ease in python, go for cs 50 or even better Google Python for everyone or py4e.com that will be your python syllabus you got videos and codes to practice \n\nApart from that read about various kind of tech, not over a 50,000 ft a little more detailed technology of various type works. Just random good youtube channel\n\nAlso , 3blue1brown. Google that.\n│   └── Let me do a wild guess.. You studied inChaitanya /narayana\nAm I right?\n│       └── Yh😅🥲\n└── Revising the IP 11th std. Python related chapters are good enough for the first two units of the Python course; 12th std. chapters are good if you want to do some skill-building\n    └── Is it better to start with c Or python\n        └── The college will start with Python most probably in the 1st sem, and then they'll do C in the 2nd sem; So starting with Python will be better",
    "Make sure you know how to do integration and differentiation. Even limits. First year focus is that. But then it depends on your stream.  Also aim to get grades higher than C to survive otherwise your whole gpa is gone. First year matter...don't neglect it."
