  "title": "[Question] Need more details about PESU RR Boys hostel outside campus.",
  "content": "On reaching out to the warden of PESU RR over the phone I am informed that there are no vacancies there in the hostel which is within the campus. There is one outside campus costing Rs 2.2 lakh. I think it is a private one with which PESU has some tie-up. However more details he shall share only after admission process is completed. Is anybody aware of details of the PESU RR Boys hostel outside campus? Please share. I need details like:\n\n* Detail Text address, Google location\n* Commute facility between college and hostel. Does it cost extra / is included in the Rs 2.2\n* Photos of the rooms. ( Twin sharing, attached bathroom). Room size and what furniture and other stuff is already available etc.\n* Wifi availability\n* Hot water, electricity back up etc.\n\nPlease reply.\n\nUpdate: I think Rs 2.2 is costly compared to the in campus hostel charges of Rs 1.7 lakh. Guys who are joining after KCET R2 should forma group and inform each other about nearby PG, shared apartment availability etc. If there is already a group / discord server please share those details as well.",
