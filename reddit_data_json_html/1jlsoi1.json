    "They even own and manage one of the messes in boy's hostel. They are the only mess that gives huge amount of paneer. One of my friends did the iodine test and it turns out, they use analogue paneer. Paneer is served almost every single day over there.",

    "I recently visited the ec campus, the ec campus canteen chefs cook a good taste and hygiene food, even less than the price of rr campus canteens.\n└── really? How is the 4th floor canteen? is there any pure veg canteen in ECC?\n    └── Not sure I study in rr, probably ec guys can pick this question."
