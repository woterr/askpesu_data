    "1. Cvent : 8.5 + cutoff\n2. Sixt : 8.5 + for AIML , 9+ for CSE\n3. AMD : 9+ for CSE and AIML\n4. Schneider : 8+ For CSE and AIML\n5. Dover : 8+\n6. GoTo : 8.5+\n├── Out of way question but how many are the total students or total eligible students?\n└── Schneider was 8.75+ for cse afaik\n    └── The cutoff I mentioned was for the test.\n        └── I am talking about the test as well, it was 8.75+ for cse, donno about other branches\n            └── It was 8.5",
    "HPE CTY - 18\nETA: didn’t see that it was under summer PPO’s mb\n└── What's there ctc btw?\n    └── 17.5 LPA with 12 base\n        └── Oh nice 👍",
    "Is there anyway of getting to know what was the gpa of the students in the placement \nAnd secondly how many web and app developers get on campus placement generally?\n└── Generally everyone gets hired as SDE/SWE only few companies hire android developers; Most companies hire generally and after your 6month internship you will be allocated a team",
    "SAP's CTC is completely bogus lmao. They don't offer anywhere near 26\n└── That's what mentioned in jd . But I get your point \"benefits of 8L\" so technically it's 18 n fixed is 10L\n    └── Don't they generally include the benefits(atleast part of it if u opt out like transport etc) with base pay\nAnd that's ur inhand salary?\n\nAnd I think the pay is fine imo.",
    "In the GPA cutoff section, few of them are just blank what does this mean?\n├── i think they dont have info abt it, if anything is blank the person who made this might not know it\n└── Companies come with bare minimum cutoffs allowing everyone to apply. But they shortlist randomly for OA based on their own criteria which is not known to us also\n    └── So basically it's their way of of kicking out lower GPA kids without being mean to them? Xd\n        └── Lmao yeah .... Apple only came for 7 GPA this time.... but they end up taking min 9.5+ for interviews lol\n            └── I'm currently on 8.46 CPI and was wondering if companies reject 8.4ish people just cos they're not 8.5 exact mm\n                └── Tbh .... Placement is a game of luck .... Sometimes ppl with 7-8 also get shortlisted for OAs while some with 9+ only don't. Eternal pulled that crap. So many above 9 din even get shorlisted while the cutoff they gave was 8.5+. And blud .... U have another whole year to max ur GPA .... but yeah, advisable to pull that above 8.75+ atleast for a hassle free tier 1 shortlisting\n                    └── Yeah GG, will try my best... to atleast not lose this this GPA battle alas can control the controllables......",

    "Which is more demanding for jobs data science or machine learning ?\n└── Data Science has pure demand .... Companies coming for DS roles are giving some insane packaged compared to SDE. ML also has its stride. But not many companies have come yet particularly for ML while DS roles have been prominent",
    "Is there any placement data for MBA students.",
    "Which branch? Are all these for BOTH cse and cse aiml?\n└── Calm down nig, stop spamming same comment again doesn't help😭\nYes this is for both cs and aiml\n    ├── Omg so sorry. It kept saying some error, I thought my reply wasn't being sent. I checked now 😭\n    └── All the offers? Or are there some companies which asked cse students only? This is the first year of placements for aiml branch so i am curious. Anyways thanks for the reply and the list\n        ├── CSE and AIML both have sat for all the companies that have come till now and there has been ntg specific to AIML or CS. A couple of companies have come for entire [B.Tech](http://B.Tech) allowing ECE EEE as well.\n        └── So some companies do ask specifically that they want cs students itself but for vast majority of companies it's combined.",
    "Which branches? Are all these for BOTH cse and cse aiml?\n└── It's a combined placement stat for software companies not based on branch"
