    "I'm from pes ecc 3rd yr. My home is in Hebbal North blr,\nI tried traveling in 2nd sem to and fro, it drained the fuck out of me. Mornings it took me 1.1 hr but evening makes it 2.5 to 3 hr thanks to Blr traffic. I would go to Hebbal via majestic in BMTC . Later shifted to PG and now its Peace !",
    "I completed my degree commuting daily up and down 32kms, from HSR to RR Nagar, honestly at points I felt annoyed, especially with silk board traffic. But now that I look back I honestly don't think it was that bad. It's better than renting and living in small apartments imo.\n└── in the same situation as a newbie, do you recommend getting a car or is the bus good enough?\n    └── Idk about car, I used to commute on a 2 wheeler. I would try out bus for a few days to get a good idea if I was you"
