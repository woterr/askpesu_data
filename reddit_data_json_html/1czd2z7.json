    "Definitely not worth it, you'll definitely regret it a lot, this college is not even worth paying for 4.8 lakh per year through PESSAT, management will probably be at least 15 lakh per year for CS, you're better off studying abroad with that kind of money.\n└── management is currently 12lakhs rn a year for cs.But we are taking student loan soo like after i get placed mayb can cover the loan?soo whats your poll on this?and how is the return?\n    ├── Even for 12 lakhs I don't see how it can be remotely worth it, not everyone gets a high salary here, and in the future, there is only more uncertainty with the rise of AI to replace jobs. Maybe if you are really passionate about CS, then joining here won't be that bad, but if you join purely with the intention to just make money, then nope, don't come here, it is better exploring other avenues, you'll be filled with regrets just like I did after 3 years of being here.\n    │   └── not really into CS jus doing it cause uk getting along the ratrace.\n\nsoo what are the other avenues you would suggest?\n\nwhat are the regerts you had?if you can expalin it too me i would try and discuss with my parents.\n\nthank you\n    │       └── I just didn't like development, the subjects here didn't interest me enough, combined with the fact that most of the faculty is really bad at teaching. If I was in your place, I would spend 1 year preparing to get into merchant Navy through DNS. It's just a one year course after which you start earning. The pay is really good in the long run, decent even in the earlier stages as all income is tax free. You just don't have to have power for your eyes.\n    └── Bro when did they change it to 12 isn't it 11\n        └── this year ig not sure",
    "you really want to spend 10-15 lakhs a year for CS?\n└── it is 12 but yeaaaa but like student loan? will that work?\n\nthe real question is,is it worht it?paying that much the return?\n    ├── loans are not worth it. it will become an unnecessary burden for your parents and you\n    │   └── i have been telling my parents the same thing but they treat me as child so yeah.\n    └── The Average package for CSE at PESU RR Campus is around 11-12 Lakhs. Do you really want to spend 60 lakhs(for 4 years) for getting a package of 11 Lakhs 😵‍💫. It's not worth it, to take a Loan.\n        └── will discuss and give an update",
    "Dude no way, just go to msrit or bmsce if u have the option.\n└── kcet results are yet to be annouced soo will wait for those results as my comedk went bad",
    "Keeping it simple and straight forward :-\nManagement quota is not at all worth for any branch in both the campus\n└── why do you say so?\n    └── It's not worth giving that amount of money, the sole  reason.\nCampus life is not that worth the amount Management students will be paying",
    "Not worth it at all, especially considering you're considering things like an education loan. Please don't go for it. \n\nIm a third year ECE management student, there's nothing I regret more than this. Even the PESSAT fees is very high now, not worth it at all. Get the thought out of your head, save your money.\n└── but i am getting no where else like bmsce my parents didnt like it much and also i am jus an average student in studies like pretty decent enough. As of now only my pessat result have been with me soo my parents considering to go with management as there isnt much diffrence between the actual pessat fees and management hopefully.",
    "Mate, it's gonna depend purely on u. I know a guy who got in through management like 10 years ago (the fee for management was prolly 5 lakhs per annum back then which is basically pessat fee rn) who made it even tho he got in through management. He's in san francisco now, working at Microsoft, he completed his master's from UCLA last year. But I also know ppl who got in through management seat who r jobless, and these failure stories are a lot more than success stories so keep that in mind. If u wanna work ur ass off, it's a good place and at the end of the day it's all gonna depend on u. If u wanna pursue ur masters abroad then joining top institutes like RV, PES or BMS  is crucial. Applications from wackass institutes like Jyoti n Sambhram n all, good universities abroad won't even give u a chance, so keep that in mind too.\n└── abroad is the plan,but what if we are just an average student or maybe above average?then is it a good place to go with?\n\nthank you for the advice.",
    "Anything above 20 lacs(4 yrs )in these institutes ain't worth it\n└── will discuss and give you an update.",
    "No",
    "Straight answer No. Long answer, nothing is worth out of this college, the sooner you understand the better. Stay away from here and you’ll end up better provided you put in the right efforts, coz PESU won’t let you put in the right efforts also.",
    "Don't join not worth",
    "Nope"
