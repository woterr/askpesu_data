    "1st sept 2nd round of counselling \n4-5 days gap and then orientation\nAnd then 1 week of bootstrap \nMaking 2nd week of sept the most probable time of college starting\n\nEven if kcet counselling gets more delayed \n(Deadline is 29th)\nSo 2nd round gets postponed to maybe 4th \n9th orientation\n16th classes start maybe possible\n└── Don't you think they've delayed enough to delay even more?\n    └── Wdym\n        └── I mean that usually many colleges start by now, and still not giving a proper date, is kinda unfair i feel. \n            └── Its not their fault for kcet counselling getting delayed because of neet supreme court hearings\n                └── Yeah true my bad."
