Is there a generic PESU drive where they store this. Somehow I could not find this in PESU academy. Are there any other places we need to explore other than [https://better-pes.vercel.app/content](https://better-pes.vercel.app/content)  for notes and stuff\n│   └── Join the PESU discord and you'll find the PESU Media discord there. Also use this link :  \n[https://pesufy.netlify.app/docs/](https://pesufy.netlify.app/docs/)\n├── what are the credits for sem 3 subjects?\n└── how much difference between this and cse core?\n    └── Well instead of Linear algebra , AIML students have more complicated math. and instead of Digital Design they have System on a Chip design which is basically Digital Design + Other stuff like Microprocessor architecture. So it's mostly the same thing with extra stuff\n        └── like will it be an issue if I go for masters?\n            └── Ultimately, the best choice depends on your long-term goals and interests. If you're certain about pursuing a career or further studies in AI/ML, the CSE (AIML) specialization could be beneficial. However, if you prefer to keep your options open or are interested in exploring various fields within computer science, a Core CSE degree might be a better fit.\n\n\n\nSome Master's programs may prefer or require a broader background in computer science, which a Core CSE degree might better provide.\n\n\n\nBut then specialized programs in AI/ML may find your CSE (AIML) background particularly appealing as well. \n\nI'm not too sure about MTech prerequisites cuz I'm joining PES this year too and idrk ,  but I  hope the above makes sense\n                └── yes thank you",
