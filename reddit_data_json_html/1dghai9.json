Where is our goddamn basic right to roam freely on campus without feeling like fucking criminals? It's complete bullshit that just being here now makes us feel like we've committed a crime. This place was supposed to be where we make memories, not where we're counting down the days to leave. How can the management think these changes make things better? \nThese make it WORSE!!!\nThese make it SO MUCH WORSEEEE NOW!!!!",
