    "Yes the fees paid is refunded back after a few comparatively minor deductions if a student plans to withdraw seat before the semesters start(don't know the exact duration)\n\nActually u will be better of clarifying this with the administration than the subreddit just to be safe\n└── okay tysm. i did email and message them but i didn’t get a reply that’s why i asked on here\n    └── If u are a blr resident go to the campus and get to know about the procedure or try calling them (numbers on website)\nMails might take some time or not be replied at all"
