Parents don't get me back home on weekends or holidays, every holiday goes in this place, they don't let me go overnight to friends or relatives here either, same monotonous life forcing myself to come back by 6:30 to hostel, sigh",

I bet you can have just as much or even better experiences in hostel with your roommates and tons of other things!\nâ””â”€â”€ Oh trust me, girls hostel is not even a fraction as fun as boys hostel// subjective but that's what I confer from what I've heard haha\n    â”œâ”€â”€ Girls hostel could be fun if you wanted, you could have garba in your room with friends lmao\n    â””â”€â”€ I mean it's \"subjective\" for a reason",
    "The problem is Indian Parents. Hostel is just an enforcing function of what parents ask for from Universities.\nâ””â”€â”€ Exactly, if the hostel would let kids be free parents wouldn't like it and not send their kids, plus the college doesn't want to risk shit",
