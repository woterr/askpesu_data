  "content": "So I got cse core in ec campus in the first round of counselling. We were looking for hostels and found this amaatra academy living space thing 5-6 km outside the campus. My family is like in btech you have to study a lot so it's best to stay at a hostel rather than a pg. But i saw the rules and regulations of this living space yesterday and I'm TERRIFIED. Wdym i have to take permission to use my laptop and no phones after 11 pm??? And coming back till 6:30 pm, can't leave your room from 6 pm to 7 am, permissions for everything, no meals from outside, can't cook inside the rooms.\nI've never lived in a hostel before but these rules seem way too harsh.\nIs anyone living there? Are these rules actually implemented?",
