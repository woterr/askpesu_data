Would be helpful if someone could share the AIML 2nd year syllabus and subject list.",

    "PES teaches DSA in C. And for our batch (23-27), there was no difference in the core 2nd year subjects at all.\n└── From Sem 3 onwards, are the batchmates going to remain the same for all classes as they were in Sem 2, based on SRNs? Or is there any reshuffling done?\n    └── Sem 3 is the last reshuffling based on branch/SRN, first 60ish ppl 1 class, next 60ish next class etc., this class won't change for 2/3/4th yr"
