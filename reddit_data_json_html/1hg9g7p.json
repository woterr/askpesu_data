    "When it rains heavily in Bangalore and PES has its own backwaters.\n└── Backwaters? It’s a goddamn ocean I am sure + the island too.. Wouldn’t be bad hiring a ship to sail across the water to reach Mrd!\n    └── In EC campus, it only floods near the parking area not entirely, so backwaters is a suitable term.\n        └── Huh!? You haven’t seeen the ocean it used to create in pixel block and the area infront of the waterfalls? Strange!\n            └── Nevermind. 👍🏼",

    "Contrary to popular belief, PES used to be really fun (until 2nd year when who-must-not-br-named took over). My first year was filled with fests (plenty of which I was a core lead), competitions (represented PES at NIT!) and other stuff, made great friends whom I'm still in touch with (some of whom are pursuing Masters with me right now in the same uni), interacted with great profs and published good research. \n\nPES (and most colleges in our country) are what you make of it.",
