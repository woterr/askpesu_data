    "I haven't heard a bigger joke than pessat being on par with bitsat and jee mains level. I think it's a just narrative spread by the pesu management to make it seem like they're a college on par with BITS and nit.\nLet's face it. No ambitious and sane person will have pes as his first choice. Its always his last resort college.\n\nI myself being a neet student with no coaching in math whatsoever could clear pessat with a rank of 1011. And the only reason I even wrote pessat in the first place was because my father thought I would fuck up neet. \n\nConsidering my preparation for CET , I would say even cet level preparation is way more than enough to clear pessat.\n└── lol , fr.. when i gave my pessat exam i came totally unprepared as i didn't want to get into this college at all. and i did manage to get a good score.\n    └── bruh are you fr? I was scared after I went through some of the reddit",
    "cet preparation is more than enough for pessat...i wrote jee and didnt do particularly well but still got a rank of 700 in pessat. trust me, its more than enough\n└── thank you, do you know the cutoff rank for cs and cs with aiml for rr campus and is the ec campus a good option?\n    ├── ~1000 for cse ~1300 for aiml rr campus iirc.\n    ├── As a 3rd year student, I've heard nothing but terrible things about the ec campus lol. You're better off in the rr one.\n    │   └── I can’t comment on the academic side of it…but I’m in EC campus rn for a hackathon, and it deffo is bigger lmao\n    └── how was your pessat paper?",
    "Bruh, I wrote pessat last year. Here's how my things went  \nThe difficulty of the paper depends on what day you attempt. I felt BITSAT was much harder.  \nThe maximum difficulty as you mentioned is in par with JEE.   \nI belong to covid batch and was not particularly serious about my studies in 11th and 12th.   \nI attended coaching for maybe 5 months in 12th and ended up scoring 77%ile in JEE 1st attempt and 15%ile in second, 87k rank in CET and 15k in COMED-K. (Keep in mind that I was not serious).  \n\n\nI dont know what sort of luck turned out but I ended up with a 7k rank in PESSAT(It is too high for my expectations). I was not invited to the counseling since I was not eligible for my rank. Days later they call me offering EEE seat for my rank. It was too late cuz I had already blocked seat in 3rd round COMED-K and surrender time was over.   \n\n\nSo here is what you do, If you are confident about your preparation and if you are in luck you can get an excellent rank in PESSAT.  \n\n\nPerform well, All the very best!\n└── Yo bro which college did you get via comedk?\n    └── I chose RNSIT CSE\n        └── I'm in the same boat as you RN. I am expecting a sub 10k rank in kcet and probably would get mit blr as well (IT branch). Will be writing pessat in some days. How is RNS? How is the faculty?\n            └── RNS is set to be autonomous in the following few months. They faculty is very friendly, skilled and knowledgeable. Campus is huge and has good infrastructure. The environment is also good.\n                ├── How's RNS mechanical branch ?\n                │   └── Mech teachers are the kindest and every single one of them is very skilled. \nSince scope is less for mech the intake is 60\nLabs are well equipped as well\n                │       └── Patil sir told me the placements were really good this year\n                │           └── RNSIT is placement paradise. If you join here you dont have to worry much about that\n                └── Good to know 👍",
    "The question level is not too tough, they're on par with state competetive exams like eamcet, kcet, mhtcet etc. But time management is very crucial, 180 mins 180 qns. So you need to really work on your speed, and from this year they put negatives :(, marking scheme is +1 -0.25.\n└── Thank youu I was so shit scared listening it's on par with bitsat and jee.",
