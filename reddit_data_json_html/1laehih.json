    "Very fair. They could even hold it in the same style as backlog exams (100% from ESA, no assignments/quizzes/labs), and charge people per credit. Many would actually sign up for this to improve their scores.\nâ””â”€â”€ What can be done about this so that PES starts holding improvement exams?\n    â””â”€â”€ I don't know their reason behind *not* having it, so I don't know what could be said to counter it. Besides, I don't think you're going to see any changes soon because this has been a long standing point for years. You're welcome to try discussing this over with the COE and finding out the reason they don't provision it.",
    "Has PES never in its history had improvement exams?\nâ””â”€â”€ Under normal circumstances, no. They did hold it once for a single semester during COVID."
