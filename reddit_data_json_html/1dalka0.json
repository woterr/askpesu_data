    "HCI(Human Computer Interaction) and AIRIW(Algos for Info Retrieval) were offered in CSE as electives in Sem 5 and 6 respectively.  HCI is easy but a bit unpredictable scores-wise because nobody got an S in our batch. I didn't take it though but I know friends who did. AIRIW is easy, it used to be a VERY easy subject with an effortless S or A before but it does require some amount of work now lol. It's still mostly theory with easy projects/assignments.\n\nCSE has Data Analytics as a single subject where recommender systems was the last chapter.\n└── Data analytics is a core or elective for cs?\n    └── Data analytics is an elective.",
    "Human Computer interaction   \nAlgorithms for Information retrieval and intelligence web\n\nThese 2 are there in CSE as far as i know",
    "God made Branch AIML 🙏🙏\n├── Is there any faculty in AI/ML publishing in SCI on these topics?\n│   └── Not sure\n└── If this God exists then he has to beg for my forgiveness\n    └── hehe"
