    "Tf so unfair to c cycle people, we had exams at morning when we were in p cycle, and we have the exams at the same time now fuck pes\n├── Also one less study holiday than phy cycle people 🫢\n├── dw this is a canon event\n│   └── Wait are all sem 2 timetables like this??😭😭\n│       └── Yeah one half of students have it in afternoon both sems and the other half have it in morning both sems. In our case we also had a day less for subject (don't remember which one) than the other batch to study\n│           └── Was the evs/constitution exam the last? Or right in the middle?\n├── Unpopular opinion but I'd prefer exams happening in the morning more than the same happening in the afternoon\n│   ├── Same here, and I lived 90 mins away from campus. I used to have ESAs from 1:30-4:30, and that basically meant after I reached home there wasn't really any energy or time to do anything. \n\nNow, I've got exams at even worse times - last semester my exam was from 7-9 pm 😭\n│   └── Coz u nearer to clg? People who are far have the problem\n│       └── No not really, I live pretty far from college lol\n\nIt's just that I don't fw the idea of writing the exam in the afternoon because I feel comparatively less productive than I do in the morning\n│           └── Good for u bro..\n├── L\n└── How is it fair for phy cycle people tho?",
    "Its just called “draft” \nThis will only be the final esa timetable :D\nIf u want changes means talk to ur dept and seek their help\nUsually they dont change"
