    "It should be a combination of both, you need to have decent knowledge of dsa to clear coding and interview rounds. You need to have 4-5 good projects which you can put on your resume. You can never know what theyâ€™ll ask in interviews.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ ThanksðŸ¥²\nâ””â”€â”€ But if I have no tech projects in my resume... will they ask only DSA then?\n    â””â”€â”€ wdym you have no projects? Dude you need to have 3-4 projects in your resume, what did you do in your engineering then?\n        â””â”€â”€ I'm a fresherðŸ« ... I just wanted to know whether DSA is the only requirement cause I'm in ECE. So along with the other projects in ECE i have to do a few Tech projects as well ryt?\n            â””â”€â”€ Itâ€™s good if you have a few projects in hand, have one web dev, one ML based and a database based one to start with. DSA is not the only requirement, interviewer can ask anything from DSA, your core subjects(CN,OS,DBMS etc), resume related etc..\n                â””â”€â”€ Got it. Thank you",
    "dsa - leetcode easy to medium..very important to crack intervies if u are aiming for T1 companies..(most of them ask for dsa)..regarding development...u can crack companies offering 10 lpa + (but it depends on luck sometimes) and which domain r u interested in\nâ””â”€â”€ So, max companies (T1+T2) ask for DSA in most of the rounds, right?\n    â””â”€â”€ Not really. Interviews tend to be about your projects, expertise and the company. They will ask DSA but that's usually for one round max.\n        â””â”€â”€ So, focusing on both and diving deep in development, too, is a must, I guess... how's the scenario of MERN in placements these days btw?\n            â””â”€â”€ Diving deep in the subject of your liking/expertise is very good. \n\nDon't have too much info on MERN but I have seen plenty react dev roles.\n                â””â”€â”€ Thanks, buddy!!",
    "Keep development in resume and DSA on fingertips\nâ””â”€â”€ Thanks :)"
