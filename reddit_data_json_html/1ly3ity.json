    "ECE you might be able to upgrade to.. CS is no chance, even if you get a perfect 9.5+ , the seats available are usually just under 5",
    "I'm from 27 batch, our respective cutoffs were:\nCse rr - 9.45ish\nAiml rr - 8.6+\nEce i dont remember.\n\nBut it is honestly not that hard to get aiml if you want to, even studying just a week before exams is enough to get you 9+\n└── No it's not, highly depends on an individual's capabilities\n    └── Well that is obvious, but it isnt that hard if you actually understand what ur studying instead of just mugging it all up\n        └── Not impossible, but pes is known to fuck people over pretty bad, doesn't always go ur way\n            └── True that",
    "Guys I am looking out for ece or aiml only !! Not correct cse so wht are the chances !! \n\nI'll either take eee in rr and do it ?\n└── Ece in rr shouldn't be too hard. Maybe 8.5+. Then again getting an 8.5+ is hard sometimes"
