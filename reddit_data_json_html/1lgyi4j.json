    "Try to write psuedo code or the logic first then move to code.  \nFor React just code , keep coding , you will get lot of errors when running , try to fix them slowly. You have DBMS , SE  next sem . Try to built projects for them during semester. Dont spend extra time for these projects. Do it along with these courses and add them to your resume",
    "Leetcode, leetcode and leetcode. Nothing else matters as much for on campus opportunities\nâ””â”€â”€ Bro do they ask system design questions for on-campus opportunities?\n    â””â”€â”€ Yup they do, especially low level design. I made the mistake of only doing DSA and got rejected by a really good company (25+ ctc) for not being able to do LLD.\n        â””â”€â”€ Ok thx."
