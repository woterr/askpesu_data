  "content": "Im a fourth year student doing my internship right now, now I have money but dont have time on weekdays lmao , however my friend group is planning to come to AT, ONE LAST TIME. I saw some post where you add the tickets on some website in ur cart and collect from OAT. What BS is this just make it like the usual years na, buy it on pesuacademy and a mail comes to you with your ticket. Or is that coming later? Either ways please try to make this completely online. We have some of the smartest people in Bangalore, and it has been done before so PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, try to make the ticketing completely online.",
