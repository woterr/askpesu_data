    "Hi, so you should get a notification to be in college by 8am tomorrow... They will ask you to gather at the silver jubilee block auditorium or the golden jubilee block auditorium... They will run through a quick orientation for the students followed by you dispersing into your specific bootstrap groups. Pretty sure there will be 4 or 5 like previous years, with each group being occupied with a separate activity.\nIf you haven't gotten a notification on the pesu app yet, check your email, cos that's the only other place they can message you. Hope y'all have a great bootstrap (bunk how much ever you want, that shit is not important üíÄüëç)",
    "Just get a notebook if you want , you don't need laptop and shit , they'll inform you where to gather tomorrow,  I think it's ec related tomorrow for bootstrap tomorrow.\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Alright thanks, and any idea about the timings",
    "No idea what to do, when to come, what to bring? PES is toying with us\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ What your seniors would say \"Welcome to PESU\"\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Exactly",
    "Come by 8",
    "So just to confirm, we need to be at one of the auditoriums at 8 AM tomorrow right?"
