    "PES CSE ≈ NITK CSE provided you have a 9+ gpa. If you fall into that category or not is for you to decide.\n\n1.Clg life is good if your friends are good\n2.Professors some are great some are trash (depends on luck)\n3.Extra curriculars are plenty it's just that people are so caught up w studies they barely get time for any but you can easily manage both imo \n4.Friend groups again is luck\n├── ah damn okok aight\n├── PES CSE = LPU CSE for every any CG\n├── More like PES CSE&lt;= NIT K Mining provided you have 9.5+gpa lol\n│   └── I disagree, the placement stats are quite good, if you're in the top performers, you'll find a well paying job for sure, although the comparison with nitk is a little far fetched \n└── Thats is heavy cope ,NITK CSE is no where close to any private college",
    "I would choose RVCE over PES\n└── Better than BMS and MSRIT for sure\n    ├── yes ....it would be the case if i had the option to i got cooked in boards due to taking it lightly (78% pcm adn 77% overall).....\n\nim prepping for advance now and i need a solid backup thats why...\n\nif i know pes is always there then i can reassure my father but im asking this cuz if it is actually good..\n    │   └── Every college has some issues and some advantages:\n\nBMS  \npros : relaxed schedule (5 hours per day for 1st year), relaxed syllabus and load, some event or fest every 2 weeks. \ncons : small campus, not so good placements \n\nPES\npros : tougher but better for you curriculum, infrastructure, good placements (compared to BMS)\ncons : the syllabus is too overwhelming, not that much fests, strict and loaded schedule \n\nRVCE (Best imo)\npros : best placements among any private college in Bengaluru, good crowd \ncons : well RVU issue is there so placements are ought to degrade, not much cons tbh\n    │       ├── I think rvce has the same problems, my friends over there complaint about the lack of extra-curricular activities and excessive focus on academics, although placement wise it's the best\n    │       └── RVCE PESU and Ramaiah have a common issue(in lack of extracurriculars).\n    └── MSRIT and PES are more or less at same level. Their less intake is a huge W. Although club wise PES for the win.\n        └── What do you mean \"club wise\" , are there clubs in college we can join or participate in ??",

    "Bro join elsewhere. This Uni is not worth the money and giving up your mental health. Teachers and management treat you like crap. \n\nThey are chugging out 1000 students in the name of course like Cse with ml/ai/cybersecurity/ paneer butter masala.\n\nMy advice is to spend max 5L on your bachelor’s degree. Invest the rest.",
