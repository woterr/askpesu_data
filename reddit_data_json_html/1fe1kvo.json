  "content": "Hey y'all, Would it be useful if there was an app that helps commuters connect with commuters, eg lets say I travel from Marathahalli To PES daily and my fuel expenses accounts to almost 200 everyday. And there is a guy who'd like to tag along with me for fuel sharing. Would this app be useful for people whose fuel expenses break their bank balances? Thank you",

    "There is an app called Quickride for that purpose. It's more corporate people oriented, but it gets the work done.\n└── Wasnt it banned by govt? Like carpooling was banned right?",
    "Wdym tag along for fuel sharing?",
    "Makes sense actually \nIt would considerably decrease the fuel expenses."
