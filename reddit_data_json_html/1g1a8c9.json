  "content": "Hi I have my cgpa just in excess of 7. There are 100s of students with 8+ who are yet to get placed. I'm getting anxious as to if I will ever get a chance. I am primarily looking for internship in 8th semester. \nMost of the companies which come right now, do gpa based shortlisting,even t2 companies.\nAre there companies that hire for non tech roles?\nI don't care about pay right now. I am looking for a job in a decent company.\nI'm a cse grad by the way.  ",
