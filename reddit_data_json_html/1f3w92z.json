    "I am not a Senior but I have a few doubts in your question\n\nYou said PESU is strict. Define strict.\n\nCollege hours are 8-4. Isn't the remaining hours of your day called as free and you get to do whatever you want? You can study if you wish or you can do extra curricular if you wish to do so.\n└── I too came to know about from internet and all . What I heard Is even after college, there will be so many assignments projects and homeworks and some seniors on reddit also shared that their schedule is so tight and they get no free time",
    "Relax, PES being strict just applies to how they are in college, what you do before and after college is completely upto you. If you're talking about assignments and stuff, it's the same as any other college, it won't take much of your time usually. The amount of free time you have depends on how far away from college you live and how late you sleep. You can easily have 5-6 hrs free time per day if you manage it right. It's not as bad as you think dw. Especially not in first year. Chill out and have fun!\n└── Thanks for the answer I'm looking for",
    "Only you can decide how much free time you get, depending on YOUR time management.",
    "depends on ur course n timetable."
