    "And 8 fucking sub questions for a fucking 4 marker ?!?!? Who ever set that paper was retarded af",
    "imo CN is one of those subjects you simply can’t cram in a day, or even a week because there's just so much content. This is actually the one subject I like and studied beforehand, but even I was completely WTFing during ISA. They just threw in the most random \"case study\" ass word salad along with those ridiculous names.",
    "For CSE , the 4 markers was easy.\nThe paper setter just fucked around by using some fancy words and given the simple question like a case study or something.\nTo understand them is somewhat difficult.\nAnd as you said the mcqs , they fucked everyone with multiple answer for the multiple choice questions.",
