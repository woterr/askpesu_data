    "I had a management seat but got in through JEE Quota, they said the excess amount will be refunded automatically, but it was infact not automatic. \n\nI emailed Kavyashree (admissions office) and she asked for some documents, and later said that the refund would be initiated \n\nIt's been 4 days since i got that email ðŸ’€ still no refund\nâ”œâ”€â”€ I was in ur situation but pessat last year, they gave the excess back in like 3 days\nâ””â”€â”€ Bro any update ? I still didnt get the refund, I contacted them last week through email and they said they will refund in 1 week time.\n    â””â”€â”€ i went to the campus to get it squared out, they said they'll refund by monday\n\nso i think its like a 2-3 week wait time until they refund",
    "Whenever I call them, they say a refund will be generated within 10-15 days. Initially, they said the refund would be generated within 10 days of counselling, but still, I have no idea when the refund will be issued.\nâ””â”€â”€ dude what to do now they cant just keep doing this and which number did u call on they arent picking \n\nup my calls only",
