    "Does relative grading exist for epd?\n└── What do you mean exist for epd? Relative happens when there is no one who's scored more than 95\n    ├── Ohh then its impossible there will be some legend who will ace todays test\n    ├── That's not happening, I know one person who will definitely score above 95\n    ├── Waw fr?\n    ├── fr?\n    │   └── Yeah that's how relative grading works. There is no point of absolute grading when everybody is shitting their exams.\n    └── bruh who told u this, when math had reletive last year ppl did cross 95. Reletive grading happens when a lot of people fail.\n        └── 95 overall? As in esa+issa? \nNo chance. Btw I am a 3rd year student.  We had a subject called software engineering in 5th sem which was the easiest subject till date in this college. People got A grade for 71 marks including me. And moreover only 5 ppl failed in this subject.\n            └── But is there a rule like that? A rule that if anyone gets 95+ no relative grading, that sound so random.\n                └── In the meet Jawahar told that 95 is the threshold and if nobody scores 95 the difference between the guy's marks and 95 will be added to everybody.\n                    └── jawu is full of shit if i am not wrong.",

    "Another post about paper rants. I swear I'll start discussing the answers here so you'll slip into depression😭😭😭.\n└── noo😭😭😭",
    "Wait for physics cycle 💀\n└── the paper was mad cooked compared to the 2023 and 2022 paper that i solved before the exam\n    └── I solved 2024 paper irl and i relate with you 💀\n        └── 2023 and prior paper were literally asking u the most basic shit.",
