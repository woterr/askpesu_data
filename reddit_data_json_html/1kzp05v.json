    "Check out https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/. These are courses by MathWorks themselves. I recommend starting with MATLAB OnRamp and doing the basics/fundamentals first. PES's MATLAB courses were dogshit, and this is slightly better and a good revision.\n\nI'm not from ECE, so I can't really comment on the SPaSE domain aspect, but considering how many courses are there, you might recongise a few relelvent ones and do it"
