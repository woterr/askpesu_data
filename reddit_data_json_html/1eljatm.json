    "go with OS if you've no coding experience whatsoever but if you can code a little bit choose DSA it's really important and will haunt you for years if you evade it.",
    "DSA needs to be covered before DAA since it's a prerequisite. I'd follow that with DBMS and then OS.\n└── we got to pick one\n\nso objectively which ones the easiest\n    └── I already covered it in my answer. DSA is not only the easiest but it is also a prerequisite for DAA, so it must be covered first anyway.\n        └── So the order goes like DSA, DAA, DBMs and then OS\n            └── Yes",
    "Finding any subject \"easiest\" is very subjective.  \nDSA - Coding (in C) + Algorithms. Engaging and challenging sometimes.  \nDAA - Algorithms and its psuedo codes. Easy mostly except for some concepts at the end of the course.  \nOS - Theoretical subject and the syllabus was huge so not anywhere around the \"easiest\" category.  \nDBMS - I am in 5th sem but I think the subject is very engaging and practical. Idk about the difficulty.",
    "DSA can help you to crack your interviews",
    "DAA is the easiest but 1st u hv to study DSA so choose  DSA..DSA clg syllabus will be easy not so complex.."
