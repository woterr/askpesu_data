    "So we had asked this same question to Jawahar before and he told us that there was a bus stop until the the board got removed by someone. I highly agree that it is not safe especially since you need to walk all the way till Konnapana Agrahara bus stop where a lot of heavy duty vehicles like lorries go.",
    "This is actually an issue which needs to be addressed. The traffic at hosa road and near ec campus is so bad. It takes atleast 30 mins to travel in this shit traffic.",
    "If enough people complain, they might do something about but it will take a long time with consistent effort to get them to address such issues. In the mean time, just leave your house 20 minutes earlier.",
    "Then we as Students have to plan before only right seeing all these issues."
