    "PESU I/O is not worth it for the most part... many of the topics covered you'll find online for free done much better. The only good thing out of PESU I/O is probably networking with mentors/people with similar interest(applicable for those slots which had really good mentors). You can probably also do this for free by interacting with seniors/joining clubs.",
