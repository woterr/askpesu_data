    "Ops playing with fire lmao ðŸ’€. Pretty sure year back is done after even sem so you got the whole academic year  to clear all backlogs\nâ””â”€â”€ cause a lot of people were saying tht if in case it is more than 24 in odd sem then they will not let u enter the even sem... i am really getting scared\n    â””â”€â”€ They can't do that cus then you won't be attending classes for an entire sem.You have the whole year to clear your backlogs basically till end of even sem. Worst case you end up writing both sem esas together at the end of the academic year\n\nDo clarify with your mentor tho",
