    "You have 4 paths in my opinion:\n\n1 ) DSA/LeetCode/NeetCode + Projects\n\nIf your main goal is to get placed through campus placements, this is the way to go.\n\nBy the time your 5th semester starts, a bunch of companies will be recruiting interns for the next summer (after your 3rd year). These internships usually convert to PPOs, so prepping early is key.\n\nGet strong in DSA, learn to trace algorithms, and brush up on DBMS + SQL. PES teaches DBMS in the 5th sem, but that’s also when you'll be giving OAs/interviews, so don’t wait till then.\n\nDo GenAI projects (solid ones) or Web Dev if it interests you. If you pick Web Dev, build something actually useful—don’t just clone Instagram.\n\nCGPA matters in this path, so try to keep it decent. That said, even if you’re not great at development, being strong in DSA and logic-building can still get you through.\n\n2) Research Internship at NIT/IIT/IISc Bangalore/ISRO/DRDO/CSIR\n\nGo for this if:\na) You’re planning to do a master’s.\nb) Your CGPA isn’t great, but you want something solid on your resume.\n\nInstead of just applying through Google Forms, try getting contacts or referrals—it’s tough for 2nd years to land official research internships otherwise.\n\nPick a topic, learn the basics, and actually get involved in the research. Build a good rapport with the professor. At the very least, make sure you get a certificate, even if there’s no stipend.\n\n3) Internship at a Startup/company (via Referral)\n\nIf you want to get some real-world experience, this is a good option.\n\nMost 2nd-year startup internships happen through referrals or direct outreach (LinkedIn is your best bet). If you have decent exposure to OS and system programming, startups in HPC-AI and System Core often have openings, even for 2nd years.\n\nEven if it’s unpaid, try to get a certificate—it’ll help later.\n\n4) Research Internship at a Private College\n\nOnly take this if you’re 100% sure about the professor you’ll be working with, their ability to guide you, and the actual problem statement you’ll be working on.\n\nOtherwise, it’s better to skip this and focus on placements or research at better institutes. Research quality at most private colleges is pretty bad—usually just for the sake of publications, and it won’t help you much in the long run.\n├── Good answer, pinning this.\n│   └── Thank you Rowlie Anna!🙏🏼\n├── These are based on a few mistakes which me and a few friends did by taking path 4, I'm a 3rd yr student (I don't hold any internship offers for the next summer as of now). please talk to 1-2 people from the rest of the three paths and follow the best guidance you get. Good luck!\n└── Okay thanks, but i still have more doubts, can I dm?\n    └── Yes sure",
    "GRIND DSA and contests. I mean just get too fucking good at it cuz next sem you will have big companies coming for on-campus summer internships (need to have a great CGPA too especially if you're a boy). Their OAs would be really tough.\n├── I have no opportunities of on campus so should i grid leetcode in summer break please tell\n│   └── What do you mean you have no opportunities for on campus? The opportunities will come when your 3rd year starts\n│       └── I mean that in my college no companies visits for any internship only some companies visits for the final year for placements\n│           └── Then you need to do all the networking, upskilling, cold mailing and all those things to get an internship. There are many yt videos on how to do this.\n└── &gt; (need to have a great CGPA too especially if you're a boy).\n\nHow much cgpa is a great cgpa?\n    ├── With respect to internships (not sure about placements) :\n\n9.25 safest \n\n9+ great\n\n8.5+ fair\n    │   └── It's similar for placements.\n    └── For summer internships for the most part it was 8.5+ to 9+. To make it to the final shortlist/list of selected candidates I observed the gpa to be on much higher side (9-9.2+)\n        └── OK thanks",
