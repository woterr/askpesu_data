    "Did u not have a mock exam?  anyway not from rr so don't remember the exact floor, all i remember from writing Pessat is that it was on the floor from where u could look down from the corridor and see all the indoor basketball courts.   \nu can just go to GJBC and ask someone to point it out for you.\n└── Oh is it the same place where we wrote PESSAT?? Also btw we had mocks but they were online so I took them from home lol\n    └── yup same place as pessat.\n        └── Alright, then I know where it is, thanks!",
