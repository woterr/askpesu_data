  "content": "Hi,\nI got a backlog for a course in the last even sem ( Jan - May 23 ). I wrote and passed that course in the following summer ( July 2023 ) but when I got my grade card, the Grade for that course was ‘F’\n\nThe COE office told me they will issue a new marks card after the backlog’s result and this will reflect my new grade along with grades of other courses taken in the semester. but the new marks card only reflected the updated grade of the backlog which I passed - not the entire semester’s courses.\n\nIs it possible that I get my lates grades for all subjects of the semester in one marks card ? \n\nIs there a way I can remove the F grade from my marks card and update it with the Passed grade.",

    "No you cannot \"update\" your marks card, if you have passed the subject , you will get the updated grade in the next semester's marks card.\n\nHowever Your degree certificate wont show any backlogs if u have cleared them.",
    "It probably hasn't been updated yet. It'll come like two weeks after the backlog results has been declared."
