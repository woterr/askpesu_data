    "A pan card is a necessary document. \nIf u will apply for a pan card today u might get it in 3 days, atleast the digital copy. Digital copy is more than enough because after the amendment, digital copies are considered the same as original copy.\n└── does that mean without ir own pan card u cant get admission in pes.will parents oan card work?\n    └── They didnt take my pan card or pan card details while admission. It may not be same for you. My take is that make a pan card for urself to be on a safer side.\n        └── did u get in through cet?\n            ├── did u get in this year?\n            └── Yes.\n                ├── this year through cet?\n                └── did u attend bootstrap today?\n                    ├── I had been to EC Campus for that community service task.\n                    └── Yup"
