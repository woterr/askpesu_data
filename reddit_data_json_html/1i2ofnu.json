    "dw they will do relative grading in maths , if u are isa marks are good u will get good grade. Dont think about it now , just focus on the next subject . All the best 👍\n├── Wait what?\n└── I did d same shit thing for my ISA1 in math but my ESA one is lyk ok ok . R they gonna judge ESA by ISA’s ? What if our ISA’s r not good but ESA r better ..?",
    "Hey its alright its ur first esa that too first sem. So many more to come a  lot of them will go well and a lot may not but it ll all be okay just do what you can to the best of yr capabilities.",
    "Don't loose confidence. I was in similar situation after writing Maths-1 ESA in fact most of us were!  \n  \nESAs for other subjects will be a lot easier than Maths-1 ESA :-)",
    "If i get a backlog in 1st sem can I clear it in 2nd sem??",
    "I understand your situation but you can increase your cgpa by working hard in next sems you don't believe my journey my sgpa was 4.55 with 1 backlog in 1st sem but I worked hard in next sems and graduated with cgpa of 7.19 and also got placed in MNC. so it's about your mindset you can increase your cgpa even if you get less sgpa that's fine try to aim for more from next sem. All the best 👍",
    "5 words. \n\nIt is what it is. \n\nTry to do better next time\n└── yeah. really hope so",
    "I'll ask you one very important question, did you have 8+ hrs of sleep? If not, your mind goes blank and you start panicking in the exam. Happened to me multiple times. And chill, it's just the first exam. Almost 40% failed the MA1 esa in my batch lol because of online classes and 8.5 cgpa is pretty good. Don't be too hard on yourself this is literally sem 1 lol. You'll have time to worry abt cgpa later. Just focus on having fun and making the best of your clg life in first year\n└── no i did not :( i see a good chunk of seniors say this is the scoring year so if i fumble my bag here then it will cause a lot of regret..\n    └── Stop stressing too much fam. If you have 8+ cgpa, you'll be shortlisted for like 95% of companies. After that, your cgpa won't even matter. It'll matter if you want to go for masters tho but you have 8 semesters. Sem 5 and 6 are usually the scoring sems actually since the subjects get easier and you can choose the electives you want. I have frnds with &lt;6 cgpa who have 10+ lpa jobs and people with 8+ cgpa who didn't get a single offer. Everyone stresses about cgpa in the first year but as long as you consistently study, you'll be fine. Cgpa isn't everything. And get proper sleep before the exams lol or so many days of studying will get wasted because you can't function properly. Been there.",
    "It's alright mate. We all were there in your position at some time. Hopefully they pass you since you're in first sem. If not, you still can improve in the backlog exam. All the best👍🏼✨.\n└── it didn't go that bad ig like ill pass deffo but a or s grade is doubtful :(\n    └── Given the subject, even a B will do good ig.",
    "Dw,at the end you'll always get more than expected,you will see.",
    "Don't mess up first year. It will affect overall GPA, if you do.\n└── yes that is my main concern :(\n    └── You still have time. Don't screw up second sem...and you can take your backlog (if you incurred it) some other time. A word of advice try and not get below C grade in any other subject if you want to maintain your gpa to a higher bracket.",
    "Chill out its your 1st exam , shathi :)",
    "Was it that tricky ? Didn’t feel so ig lengthy the par if you covered class notes properly it should have done the deal lol\n└── i mentioned in the post that i went blank so yes i could recognize the questions but it was kind of hard to answer after crying"
