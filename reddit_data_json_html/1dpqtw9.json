    "that isn't bad at all, but it isn't great either, by the time of placements just make it a 8.3 or more and it will be fine for most companies, ECE does involve physics, a lot. but it's  a lot more practical knowledge than theocraticals. quantum theory won't be that important.\n├── I was told that next year was gonna be damn tough if I can't score in phy cycle how the hell am I to score in tougher sems 😭\n│   └── work harder there is no other choice lol\n│       └── I kinda know that but am so done with last sem 😭\n│           └── 😭😭oh lord\n├── Also about the physics part can you elaborate on it please\n│   ├── 1. **Electromagnetism**: Understanding electromagnetic fields, Maxwell’s equations, and applications in communication systems.\n2. **Optics**: Concepts related to light, lenses, diffraction, and optical devices used in communication and imaging.\n3. **Solid State Physics**: Learning about semiconductor materials, crystal structures, and electronic properties (essential for understanding electronic devices).\n4. **And finally...Quantum Mechanics**: Only basics of quantum physics, wave-particle duality, and its relevance to electronic components.\n│   │   ├── I see thank you!!! Do you know where we'll get the syllabus tho\n│   │   │   └── PES Media server. You can find the link on FAQs\n│   │   │       └── Tysm but i got the PDF\n│   │   └── Solid State Physics and QM aren't part of the syllabus beyond the first year.\n\nElectromagnetism forms a chunk of the 3rd year.\n│   └── There are exciting electives involving electromagnetics, optics and quantum computing. Just today the list came, and they have been running for quite sometime. We have now spoken to the faculties involved. Do not get scared with Phy cycle faculties. There is a hell lot of difference between the profiles of first year faculties and the rest.\n\nTry to take information from serious seniors and not the ones who had fun in the subjects. Many seniors told that misguided by their seniors they took wrong subjects and later regretted as they were outdated and the grades made no meaning.\n└── what cg is required to have chance of core jobs?\n    └── if youre asking for campus placements\n\n7 to 7.5 - minimum to qualify \n\n8 - if your interview/internship goes good, then a beginner or medium job\n\n8.3 to 8.5 - beginner job guarenteed, medium and high paying job maybe if internship goes good\n\n8.5 and above- as far as your internship goes well youll get ( almost) any job",
    "Does pesu  follow vtu?\n├── No idts\n└── If they did people wouldn't be mad pissed everyday lol\n    └── Why pes is hardee than vtu or vice versa ?\n        └── Idk how to say this but vtu is pretty bad....\n\nPes is harder and upto date with their syllabus atleast more than vtu. Pes sets difficult papers aswell\n            └── Oh sooo but end of the day for placment yotube is only better na? And so you study daily ?\n                └── Lol nope. If YouTube is only better then everyone would be landing high placements off campus 🫠\n\nAt the end of the day for placement idts people only rely on YouTube. You still need to know core subjects pretty well which you could if you paid attention in class. Also teachers do matter alot in your courses if they teach well you will obviously have an edge over others.\n\nI don't study I daily I study on random days a bunch of hours together. Although I should prob change that now since I'm going to second year\n                    └── Why? Off campus people land at high palcemnts but oppurnties are less for fresher in india.\nBut most people i talked with iiitans/nit/iiit most of them are studying froms  striver/hairkrat\nAnd core concepts its there in go clases \nThey teach for gate till core\n                        └── Hey ukw if you think you can use these online resources and get placed for a high paying job off campus atb to you , ik many students in tier 1 using strivers course harkirat haven't met yet although I heard he's good. But then I'll always say this , many people do wt your trying to do and most don't succeed. \n\nAnd this has nothing to do with vtu lol.\n                            └── No no not off campus lol its very hard and high competition\nFrom kcet i may get pesu ece(tough) or bmsit or rvitm ece but  good companies allow it compnaies so i was thinking if i mog all cse grads and ace dsa and cp and can get highest package incampus \nI am getting cse in acharyaa / blah blah where only mass recruiters come so\n                                └── Ah well all the best to you. Hope you make it 🛐"
