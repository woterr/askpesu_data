    "They're considered under ECE. Most ECE kids who get placed get into IT jobs. If they had been considered as CS students, then the row for ECE would've been practically empty\n└── That means taking ece in pes is useless i should say\n    └── Known fact. Whether you are interested in ECE or taking it because you didn't get CS, PES isn't a great place for ECE. Search this subreddit, you'll find many posts that discuss the branch.\n        ├── Btw can ece studnets actually learn cse courses side by side and get a good placement, I mean how many seniors from ece dep have actually does that?\n        └── So that removes pes from my preference ig as I could only get ece",
    "It is in EC CAMPUS or RR\n└── Overall ig",
    "Nope it includes both IT and Core placements. The tier 1 placements in CS is more because there are ppl with better ranks(KCET or PESSAT) in CS than ECE, obviously CS will have better placements..."
