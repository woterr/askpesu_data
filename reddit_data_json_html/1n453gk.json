    "no need pan card , no need BEO sign  for CBSE , one for all classes enough.",
    "If you don't have an union Bank account do carry your adhaar and pan card for account opening;\n└── What if we don't have our own pan card? Can we submit it a month later as it will take almost a month to reach me?\n    └── You can do it; You can open bank account at any point of time; If you are above 18, you can even get an instant pan through income tax website with which you can get pan in 24hrs"
