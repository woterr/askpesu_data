    "I took the *Augmented and Virtual Reality Elective* back in my 5th semester. It is one of the easiest ever electives I opted and I honestly **DO NOT regret taking it.** \n\nThe teacher is just very good and teaching is very good and explains everything in class. The ISA and ESA are very easy to score as well. But it is more of theory than practical / hands-on imo.   \n  \nWe only had 2 projects, both given by teacher himself (may change this year). The first one is individual and was a Coding related project (for us it was something in OpenGL \\[basically C++\\] ). The 2nd project comprised of building something unique in Blender and Unity.\n\nOverall, its easy to score in this elective. All the course materials have been uploaded on PES Media server, the link of which can be found in the FAQs. \n\nHope this helps !!\n└── who was the teacher you had?\n    └── Adithya Balasubramanyam sir\n        └── ahh okay"
