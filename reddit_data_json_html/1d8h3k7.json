    "Yeah they did that for them. Everyone got a .5 to 1 increase\n\nWtf is this ec campus supremacy\n├── Nah there was like a legit discrepancy, people who usually get 9 ended up with a 7 or 8\n│   └── That happened in rr campus too right\n│       └── Not really. Everybody ik got a little less than what they got in the last sem. But EC peeps afaik got way lesser and ig they didn't do any moderation for them and consequently they had to take the provisional results back..\n└── Oh wow, why can't they do it for RR too?!?!\n    └── Because you got the correct marks, everyone's marks here were very low as it wasn't correct",
    "Bruh not fair at all\n\nOoad A grade graph grew overnight. I was so happy that I scored well compared to others for once\n├── Why the fuk do they use absolute grading with so many students? They need to make relative the  norm, with absolute being used only for certain courses.\n└── exactly.\n\nthey made it such that almost everybody scored an a or a b, but almost nobody scored an S\n\nin my strong subjects i should've gotten an S but got an A.\n\nin my weak subjects i got a B like i would've anyways.\n\nthey somehow managed to even fuck up grading"
