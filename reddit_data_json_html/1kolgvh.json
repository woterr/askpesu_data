  "content": "So here's the thing. I like a girl in my class, and im in first year. But she is in CS and i am in ECE, and i barely talk to girls, so ive never talked to her. But now slowly im building confidence and am hitting the gym so like yeah, getting better. But the thing is 1st year ends in like 2 weeks, and then we move to our own branches, and like im pretty sure there arent girls in ECE. So my doubt is like will you still have contact with other branch people after first year? or do we become isolated with only our branch people? ",

    "Oh definitely. Once first year ends, it’s like getting Severed. Your ECE brain takes over, and the part that knew CS girls existed? Gone. You’ll still see them around, but now it’s just polite nods and separate lives like distant coworkers you barely remember.\n├── /s?\n├── Severance reference /s\n└── Please tell me its /s :'(\n    └── Didn’t college give you your severance procedure date? /s",
