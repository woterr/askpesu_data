    "lol no, they make it mandatory to sit from 9-5pm in the 11th floor/ 12th floor lab\nâ”œâ”€â”€ is it in group\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Yes\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ how many in one group\nâ”‚           â””â”€â”€ Depends on your guide\nâ””â”€â”€ Do they monitor our work 24/7 or can I practice dsa in mean time , like can u please tell me what's the work load\n    â””â”€â”€ Honestly, it will be more like a research internship, so you might not get enough time to manage both while on duty. Perhaps after dayâ€™s work is done you can. But still you can manage to do both. No one monitors your work, but expects your assigned task be done within a deadline\n        â””â”€â”€ Okay thanku"
