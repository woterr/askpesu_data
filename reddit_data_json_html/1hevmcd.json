    "very unsure about how things will be, since the first aiml batch is still in 5th semester.\n\nit'll be interesting to see what companies will do abt aiml students. I heard pes had to convince razorpay to include the AIML students for summer internship.\n\nbut I feel that's a secondary issue outside your hands. keep up the grind, that's all you can do\nâ””â”€â”€ &gt;I heard pes had to convince razorpay to include the AIML students for summer internship.\n\nAh this is new, did not know about this. Will add it to the CS vs AIML discussion thread on the FAQs, its an important point to highlight.\n    â””â”€â”€ I found the email chain with it. The email _sounds_ like they were trying to convince Razorpay, but the rest of the email chain didn't seem to specifically indicate that Razorpay said no to AIML kids. if you want I can dm you the email chain so you can decide for yourself!\n        â””â”€â”€ Sure"
