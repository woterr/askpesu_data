    "Theres is  a chance if u do well in isa2 , projects and ESA well\nâ””â”€â”€ How much do I need to score approx in these?\n    â”œâ”€â”€ don't worry about something that hasn't arrived yet. Just try your best for isa 1 and tackle one thing at a time. If lack of preparation was the cause then you already know what you should do to make up for it next time :)\n\nall the best!!!\n    â””â”€â”€ Check the GPA related post in the FAQs for a breakdown.\n        â””â”€â”€ There's nothing much useful in it tbhðŸ«¥\n            â””â”€â”€ Your final grade is a combination of ISA1 + ISA2 + ESA + assingment/project. If you want an A grade, you can scale each component and see how much you need in the respective components. There is no \"how much\" because it depends on how you score in each component.",
