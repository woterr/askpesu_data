    "There is a long post on college vs branch in the FAQs. \n\nTLDR - if you \\*really\\* care about learning and pursuing CS, and have plans of a Masters, pick wherever you get CS. Undergrad branch matters a lot more than where you are from. Plus given my understanding, Msc does not guarantee CS as a dual option, and BITS is pretty tough to crack a high GPA. On the other hand, if all you care about is landing the highest paying job post Bachelors, pick BITS.",
    "All I'll say is msc is a huge risk if you want cse",
    "I had a similar score I got eee or something in Hyderabad back then 2022 scenario i didn't wanted to go, comedk 1100 might have got cs in rvce but late intake so I took pes cse because it was one of the colleges which was decent and was getting cs, manipal parents didn't allow, and being in general got  20k-21k rank in mains couldn't get a decent nit or iiiit with cs so yeah",
