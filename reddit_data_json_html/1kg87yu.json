  "content": "Dear male humans of PES, \n I've seen a couple of posts about this, so this is a public service announcement for those of you who still think talking to a girl requires a PhD in psychology or divine intervention\n\n1. Be hygienic and dress properly.\n\nThis is an obvious one, but a lot of guys seem to fail at it. Clean clothes, combed hair, and maybe a shower. Fix your skin, find specs that suit your face, hit the gym. Appearance matters to everyone regardless of gender.\n\n\n2. Don’t approach when she’s busy.\n\nIf she’s on her phone, with friends, or looks like she’s in a rush, don’t barge in. Wait for a better moment.\nIf she’s talking to someone else or wearing earphones, don’t bother.\n\n\n3. Talk about something relevant.\n\nIf you're in the same class, talk about class. If you’re both in the same place, mention something related to that. Keep it natural.\nSome topics could be:\n\nUpcoming exams or assignments (if you’re in the same class)\n\nEvents happening around campus\n\nMutual friends or acquaintances\n\nSomething interesting you both might have seen recently (like a movie or a TV show or the latest IPL match)\n\n\n\n4. Don’t text endlessly.\n\nIf she’s not replying, stop texting. Don’t flood her chats like some desperate idiot. If she wants to talk, she’ll respond.\n\n\n5. Observe body language.\n\nIf she’s avoiding eye contact, leaning away, or looking uncomfortable, don’t be a dumbass and keep pushing.\n\n\n6. Don’t get too close too soon.\n\nStart with simple conversation. No “you’re so cute” or “you’re like a sister” stuff. Don’t dive into deep, weird topics right away.\n\n\n7. If she’s not interested, don’t keep going.\n\nIf she’s giving you one-word answers or avoiding you, take the hint, and stop being a pest.\n\n\n8. Be NORMAL.\n\nNo “rizz” bullshit or trying to act like you’re cooler than you actually are.\n\n\n9. Give genuine compliments that are not always about looks\n\nCompliment her on her character or talents. Tell her, “You sing really well,” or \"I admire your creativity with that project\" Avoid bullshit like “You’re so hot bb.” Compliments that reflect her qualities matter a lot more.\n\n\n10. Know when to wrap it up.\n\nIf the conversation’s dying, don’t drag it out. Just walk away like a normal person.\n\n\n11. Don’t use cringe ass WhatsApp pickup lines.\n\nThey never work. Just talk to her like a damn human being\n\n\n12. If she’s mean to you, leave.\n\nIf she’s rude or treats you badly for no reason, just walk away. Don’t cling to a her just because a girl gave you a little attention for the first time in your life. Have some self-respect.\n\n\n13. Don’t be an incel.\n\nIf a girl doesn’t like you, it’s not because she’s shallow or evil. It just means she’s not into you. Don’t start ranting about how \"girls only like bAd bOys\" its literally pathetic. \n\n14. Dating apps aren’t real life.\n\n The gender ratio is skewed and a lot of girls on there aren’t even looking for anything serious. It’s not a measure of your worth. Chill.\n\n\n15. Don’t be afraid to be awkward.\n\nTrust me a lot of girls feel awkward around guys too so don’t sweat it. Just own it and keep going.\n\nBelieve it or not, girls are just like you. They have their own thoughts, feelings, and experiences. Every girl is different. Just treat them with the same basic respect and understanding you’d want for yourself. That alone makes a big difference.\n\n\nThe same applies for girls",
