    "Oh lol I was literally just reading the messages from the profs on the CCBD alumni group asking if any of us would like to volunteer to be mentors for the current batch of interns. \n\nIs this time for the Rowlet CCBD Mentor era?\n├── teach them your ways master oogway(rowlett).  \nshow them what they are capable off.  \nand get the bag also\n└── Yes please!\n    └── I need some time to figure out my workload for the summer, so I am unable to commit to being an official mentor right now. Let me see. Besides, informally, if any of you are looking for mentorship or guidance in general about anything related to what I work on, my DMs are always open.\n        └── Thx a lot, great to have you in any capacity",
