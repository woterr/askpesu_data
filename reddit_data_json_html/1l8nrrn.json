    "Whenever a batch performs poor, relative grading is done. There is no such thing that a specific sem might not have relative grading.\n└── Ohh alr can you tell me how often do we get relative grading like is it common in every sem for 1-2 subjects there will be relative ?\n    ├── no, only happens if the batch does poorly in that subject\n    └── Depends on batch performance per subject per sem, no hard and fast rule, but usually only odd sems relatively graded",
    "There is no relative grading in PES. There is some sort of moderation when everyone performs bad. But its not relative grading precisely. There is no selected subjects for these moderations.",
    "This sem is the worst"
