    "But isnt it too late to withdraw the PESSAT Seat?\n└── nope they will either give my pessat seat to someone else in the sliding round thing that jawahar mentioned or give it to someone else in the branch changing session in second year\n    └── I thought you can withdraw only if you got the same branch and same campus through KCET as the PESSAT one\n        └── You need to get PES through KCET, not necessarily same branch or campus. In my batch at least there were people who switched from RR ECE to EC CSE and stuff when they got kcet allotment\n            └── Did they slide already before round 3 ??",
    "Yes. No issues. Been there, done that. Although mine was in RR campus itself, it shouldn't be an issue as syllabus is same"
