    "There's a teacher in the AI/ML department who claims to be an industry expert, but he seems to be the opposite. He's not very good at teaching and just wants students to memorize things. It's confusing why he's in the AI/ML department because he teaches basic subjects like Software Engineering, Cloud Computing, and Operating Systems, which many other teachers could handle.
