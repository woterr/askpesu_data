  "content": "I have dropped out of college and started preparing for KCET 2025 from today. I already know 10 chapters of chemistry, but I need to start the rest from scratch. I scored around 270 in PCM in my boards, so I don’t want to have false expectations. My goal is to get a rank under 10k, but I’m not sure if it’s realistic. I’m ready to dedicate my time and work hard. Can someone please guide me on how to prepare in the best way to achieve this?Also I am thinking to  watch oneshot lectures of pw kannada and then solve the ncert + exempler + pyq's of each chapter mainly 12th, do correct if I'm wrong somewhere!",
