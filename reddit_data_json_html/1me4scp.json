  "title": "[Question]regarding PESU KCET registration &amp; counselling process",
  "content": "So I had initially registered on the PESU website, and got a confirmation mail that my registration was successful. Recently, I received my PESU KCET rank card, and then got another mail from PESU saying that there won’t be any online counselling. Instead, I have to attend offline counselling on a specific date.\n\nI called them to clarify a few things:\n\nI asked if this is for a management seat, and they told me the fees are the same as CET and it’s not a management quota seat.\n\nI also asked why they haven’t mentioned the branch allotment in the mail, and they said I’ll get to know during counselling.\n\n\nBut here's my confusion, They mentioned there’s no online counselling, but in the KEA option entry, PESU RR campus is still listed. So is this offline counselling only for those of us who registered early on PESU’s portal?\nLike… is there a separate seat allocation process going on for us? Or is this something else entirely?\n\nIf anyone has been through this or has some clarity, please help 🙏",

    "Kcet counselling is not related to pesu kcet...you have to do choice filling for kea counselling and the fees through pesu kcet is 5 LPA and through kea kcet counselling is 1.12 LPA\n└── When I called them to ask about the fees specifically..and they said it's similar to that off kea kcet\n    └── Check their website buddy ig they got confused by kea kcet counselling\n        └── Yeaaa alright..thank you soo muchh :)",
    "KEA KCET and PESU KCET both are different.  \nPESU KCET is organized by PES and i think they allocate around 10% seats for this and fees is 5LPA  \nKEA KCET is organized by KEA(govt) and has 40% seat allocation and fees will be around 1.2LPA\n└── But they did say that fees are similar to that of KEA kcet..\n    └── It's not, pes kcet is 5 lpa, not the govt one\n        └── Yea alright got it\nThank you"
