    "I don't know about mess but the cafeterias are quite good. There are a couple cafeterias on campus and some shops for snacks too. Most day scholars eat there",
    "I also stay almost 20 km apart , it's a pain to travel ðŸ˜­\nU can buy food in cafeteria if u want",
    "y dont u consider taking the hostel lol\nâ””â”€â”€ Real but curfews are a headache",
    "If you want the hostel ,do apply in 1st year.\nI too stay 21kms far and was late for applying for hostel in 1st year and suffering now.\nWhen asked for 2nd year, the hostels are full. It's a big pain...ðŸ˜­",
    "There are cafeterias in campus. My advice is to reach there as early as possible otherwise there will be a rush. If you're thinking of lunch. Breakfast maybe easier...but you have to leave ur house early. Classes begin at around 8.",
    "you can get breakfast and lunch from the hostel mess even if are not from the hostel, it is not as good as cafeteria but it is unlimited and tastes decent.\nâ””â”€â”€ Ooh I'll consider that",
    "no the mess food is terrible, you can go sit and eat there if you borrow any hostelers ID card and go sit. I tried it once and never will eat that food that shit aint good man , i have deep respect to all the hostel homies who eat that on a daily basis.\nâ””â”€â”€ Not in all the messes. Ig u tried hostel mess.\nIn the other 2 u will have to scan a QR code to enter"
