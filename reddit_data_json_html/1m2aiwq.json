    "No fees will be taken during admission, They'll ask for it later.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z35a9u0ksgdf1.jpeg?width=1104&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e378433832495335789320d4fc0a6d3cfa101015\n\nThey asked for these documents last time for us\n└── About the TC in my college they said after your admission is done then only they will give TC\n    └── Yeah you can submit TC later\n        └── Ok"
