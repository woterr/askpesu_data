  "content": "I want to take the Enterprise Business Systems elective. Could someone provide insights on the syllabus complexity, length, and difficulty level? Additionally, I'm looking for last year's Enterprise Business Systems study materials (slides, etc.)\n\nI'm also curious about the grading scheme and exam difficulty (ISAs and ESA). Insights from seniors who chose Enterprise Business Systems as their elective in the 5th semester would be greatly appreciated.\n\nI would also like to know if this subject is entirely theoretical",
