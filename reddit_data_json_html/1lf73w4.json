    "We had a 5 credit course with a very similar syllabus called Algorithms and Optimizations in Machine Learning AOML\n\nIdk why they made it a 4 credit elective\n└── Which sem was that in and also could you please send the course structure/slides if you have them.\n    └── It was in our 5th sem   \n[https://limewire.com/d/jcpfZ#DUPtAN9LHX](https://limewire.com/d/jcpfZ#DUPtAN9LHX)  \nthis lasts one week i guess\n        └── Thanks :)"
