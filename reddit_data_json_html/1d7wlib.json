    "They fucked us in ece campus, fuckers didn't put relative in here in cse.\nâ””â”€â”€ They didn't put anywhere piss off",
    "Bro cnr cutoff this time might be lower than distinction, toppers in ec campus have 7.5\nâ””â”€â”€ wha ðŸ’€ðŸ’€",
    "If CSE results are bad.. then just think about ECE.. \n\npretty sure they haven't even given relative..\nâ””â”€â”€ Many still have gotten s grades though, idk how",
    "I feel like there was absolutely no relative grading this time. 4 out of 1400 have gotten an S grade in Operating Systems so...",
    "it's bad for everyone including non-cs. 4th sem was relatively harder than the third for us.",
    "6th sem here, equally bad",
    "Okay um seniors is this a normal thing to publish false results ???\nâ””â”€â”€ Nah even our results are fked this time"
