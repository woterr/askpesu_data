  "content": "I will be joining PES University \nthis year as an ece student.\n\nI’m a 1st-year ECE student and I haven’t bought a laptop yet. I’ll definitely be buying one for coding and other work, but I just wanted to know when exactly it becomes necessary. Do we need a laptop urgently in the first few months for any subjects, labs, or assignments? Or can I delay the purchase for a while and manage without it in the beginning?\n\nWould really appreciate any advice from seniors. Thanks in advance! 🙏.",
