    "\"such great colleges\"\n\nWell well well\n├── by chance my kcet rank is not nice at all n cannot afford for payment seat i join some local college with no placement will i still get good job good package good life\n└── y not bro if u get good cgpa in pes ur life set even in RV job will come n find u u dont hve to worry but dumbo like me cant even step into such great colleges\n    ├── Firstly, in no college your life just gets set like that. And secondly, we all thought that and ended up in pes\n    │   ├── Only thing I like abt this clg is having IIITB at some distance 🕺\n    │   │   ├── we are iit bangalore afterall\n    │   │   └── They hate us cus they ain't us\n    │   ├── we all thought that and ended up in pes----then wat next bro\n    │   └── one doubt pls by chance my kcet rank is not nice at all n cannot afford for payment seat i join some local college with no placement will i still get good job good package good life\n    └── That's very far from the truth. A high GPA isn't all that's needed. In fact, the highest GPA students aren't usually the first to get placed, but it's the one with moderately high GPA.\n        └── u mean the ones who get the highest package are the ones who lie in the range 9+ ?ik u can't really generalise but, who are the ones to receive the highest packages(their gpa range?)\n            └── 8.5 to low 9.\n\nThat's because once you clear the GPA filters, GPA is irrelevant and your skills matter.\n                └── whoa did not expect that,i thought it would be 9+,so they all probaly prioritised upskiling rather than,grinding for a 9.5 or smtg?\n                    └── GPA is useless after you make it to the interview rounds. If you do not have any industry ready skills, projects, experiences etc to show that you are a valuable hire to a company, why would they take you? You need to show that you are hireable and can work for the company for the given role they are recruiting. If you have only a GPA and nothing else on your profile, they know that you won't be able to contribute anything productively and hence you'll be the first to be eliminated during interviews. \n\nUsually it's the people who have a strong profile with a moderately high GPA and a good background in the skills the company needs with quality projects and experiences who get placed first. Not to generalise, but most GPA grinders often do not put any emphasis on building their overall profile (because they sacrifice time for GPA) and that's all they have to show, which is why they struggle during interviews. \n\nThere are more details in the FAQs about placements, check those links.\n                        ├── yes thank you so much\n                        └── thanku so much tis is so healing",
    "Don't think placements is easy just because you made it to pes. That's just the first step. You have to maintain a good gpa. Upskill. If you're in any branch other than cs, then it's just that much harder. Placements is what most people go to uni for, it's in no way going to be easy\n├── By cs branch do you mean aiml too?\n│   └── Tbh i have no clue, we didn't have aiml when I was studying there\n└── brooo by chance my kcet rank is not nice at all n cannot afford for payment seat i join some local college with no placement will i still get good job good package good life\n    ├── That's very vague. If you're asking if you'll still be able to get a good package right after college, then I'd have to say no. But you can always grow. And if you're skilled enough there are chances you get a great off campus placement. Whatever college you join, give your best man. Not getting in to pes won't hinder your career progress, it might just delay it. But wherever you join, you should keep learning. Study, upskill, network, have fun and fuck around. You'll get where you want to be\n    │   └── thanks bro\n    └── I also want to add, i made the mistake of choosing a major i could give less shits about, just because pes. This is a VERY bad mistake, don't ever do it. Study what you're actually interested in studying",
    "There is an interesting story which I would like to  share here,\nI had a friend from my 1st year engg at pes.he was in cse he thought life would be simple but when placement started he didn't get any job from placement due to his cgpa his cgpa was between 7 to 7.5 at this point of time he was really disappointed but he didn't give up he built his resume in 8th sem learnt skills and he got good job with 15 lpa package but not from placement it was offcampus so my point is skills matter a lot. If you have less gpa you should prove that by building your resume with projects and skills also just by joining pes it won't guarantee you a job . You should focus on yourself and if you have skills definitely you will get good job even if you don't get from placement definitely you will get from offcampus don't worry just focus on yourself and it doesn't matter whichever college you get don't forget to maintain good gpa with relevant skills . All the best 👍\n└── thanku so much this was really needed",
    "Placement is based on your skills not on the college where you are studying \n└── oh so even if i coudnt make it to good college with no good placements can i get good job by working on skills",
    "Placements happen year around. You have to be vigilent and sit through them if you want them. Its less for Biotech."
