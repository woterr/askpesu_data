    "I asked the accounts dept regarding this... they said to pay only the extra amount and ignore the balance shown\n└── I didn't pay extra amount yet\nWhat will happen\n    └── I asked them they told they'll extend it for a week\n        └── Is there an option for yall to pay the fees?\nI dont see nothing\n            ├── me neither. ig we are supposed to go talk to accounts dept\n            └── For me I went to pay that 130000 and there there's an option to pay partial fees, they'd told me to manually type in how much and then pay",
    "i had the same problem but it's apparently meant to be like this(according to the accounts lady), you gotta click on \"other payments\" option while paying the ting, and pay either 13k or 23k based on the circular"
