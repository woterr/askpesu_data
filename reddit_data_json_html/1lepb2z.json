    "I started using a mac in the 4th semester, and had no issues. Many of my friends used macs for all 4 years. No real issues at all.\n\nYou can pretty much run whatever you need - IDEs, Anaconda and Jupyter, Apache (Hadoop, Hive, Kafka, etc), DBs (MySQL, Postgres, Mongo, Redis), etc. off the top of my head without any issues. Even stuff like Scilab. \n\nSometimes it can be kind of annoying to configure some of these environments, thatâ€™s the only problem I would say.\n\nThe only time I ever noticed an issue was during this EDM production workshop we had in our first year. My friends couldnâ€™t setup the FL Studio environment given to us on their macs so they had to watch while the rest of us learnt how to make a basic EDM track lol.\nâ””â”€â”€ No extra costing for these softwares ?\n    â””â”€â”€ Nope, never once paid for any software, environment, plugin, whatever during my 4 years at PESU\n        â””â”€â”€ Okay so you didn't face any problem expect in first year once\n            â””â”€â”€ The first year thing was just a funny moment. That was just some one day workshop that happened. Not related to any class. So no problems at all",

    "Mac user for a long time. Never really faced an issue with anything all this while, instead made a lot of stuff easier for me. Just make sure to invest in a top model and more memory since you cant really extend it later without causing some damage. If you do plan to get into fields like AR then itâ€™s best to use GPU heavy laptops instead.",
    "No issues in first year, Iâ€™m guessing the rest wonâ€™t be much different."
