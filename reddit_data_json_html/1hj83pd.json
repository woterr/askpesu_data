    "Wait.. u guys get funding for startupsðŸ˜­,ig i should've joined pesu\nâ””â”€â”€ We also get severe mental trauma. GGs\n    â””â”€â”€ Well ig that's a good tradeoff, but yeah our placements are a bit worser than u guysðŸ˜­\n        â””â”€â”€ Well life gives and takes , i see other colleges and get really jealous sometimes too. Very difficult to get a good gpa here , comparatively. PES also somewhat encourages a coaching culture over interests. But it is what it is ig.\n            â””â”€â”€ Yea ikðŸ˜ž,good luck being there bro",
    "I think their entire fund is of $500,000\nâ”œâ”€â”€ tf is that username ðŸ’€\nâ””â”€â”€ Per startup?\n    â””â”€â”€ no overall\n        â””â”€â”€ Around 4.5 cr ðŸ«¤\n            â””â”€â”€ thats a lot of money, considering that in the previous shark tank india seasons, the sharks independently have not spent more than 7-8 cr, so 4.5 cr is a good number for college kids\n                â””â”€â”€ yeah number of startups in pes is gonna be a LOT less then what show up in shark tank, also most startups here are prolly software ones, so they might need less budget initially.",
    "I would suggest not going there.\nâ””â”€â”€ why?\n    â””â”€â”€ They take too much for too less.",
    "They take Equity? Or is given in kind support?\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Yes they do take equity ,max I heard was of 25%\nâ””â”€â”€ they take equity ofcourse, but more than that if your startup is damn well successful, they will milk it for the next upcoming 25 years\n    â””â”€â”€ have they milked anything till now.\n        â””â”€â”€ dude this guy got placed in 2021 for 1.5 cr and mfs are still milking his placement."
