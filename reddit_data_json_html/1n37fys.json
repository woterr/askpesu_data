    "You will have a new section having students who joined through the second round; As only an orientation program is going on for the new joiners, you won't have to copeup much; You will have all exams at the same time as other joiner's, so if you are lagging they might speed it up or have special classes and cover it\n└── Will it be a single section or multiple section(as per previous year)..?\n    └── Multiple, during our time there were around 3 sections.\n        └── Ok Bro btw The final result is coming Tommorow \n\n will the college start from sep 8( i.e 2nd week of sept)...?\n            └── If the admissions of all students are over by that time then yes; If no it will start the next day after all admissions are done."
