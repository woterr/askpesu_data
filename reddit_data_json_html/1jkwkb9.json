    "About me: currently at NYU Courant for MSCS, batch of '22 from PES CS. \n\n&gt; I'm curious how many go on to pursue a Master's degree in Computer Science from top USA universities.\n\nMany. PES has a large alumni base at almost every top uni in the States. You'll especially find large groups of PES students at places like CMU, UCLA, UCSD, , UPenn, NYU to name a few. Everyone's also in touch with each other, there's a pretty big alumni server comprising students pursuing/pursued their MS and it's pretty active. If you want to find how many studied in a particular uni, get on LinkedIn and search using the University name along with PES. You'll find a very long list. And this is only CS. Once you start accounting for allied programs like Data Science, CE, etc, the list will expand. \n\n&gt;MIT, Berkeley.\n\nThese two don't have a standard MS program. Their MS program if present is an undergrad feeder program. So you'll find less than a handful of students from India here.\n\n&gt; is it worth leaving NIT for\n\nCheck the branch vs college post in the FAQs. Your undergrad choice of branch is extremely important. You'll find people from all sorts of Indian colleges get into top unis abroad, what is constant is the fact that 99% of them are from a related branch (CS allied if not CS). Unless you are getting a branch related to CS in an NIT, then it's imperative to pick a college that lets you pursue that branch otherwise you won't clear course requirements for MSCS applications.",
    "I’m a PESU alumni. I WOULD NOT LEAVE NITK CSE FOR ANYTHING IN THE WORLD. Most of the folks from NITK get into Uber or Adobe. Please choose NITK.\n└── Could you elaborate on what I will be missing in pes. Cuz I don't see much difference apart from the nit tag which simply won't matter once I get into a ms program. Thanks for the comment 🙂\n    ├── I’m currently applying to MS programs. US university adcoms know how hard it is to get into IITs and NITs. The brand and the tag matters. You will have a better shot to get into these universities with the NIT tag.\n    │   └── But still a lot of pes guys make it to cmu and honestly I was able to find more people that made it into cmu from pes than NITK from linkdln search\n    │       └── Ok this is a personal opinion. Most people from NITK get offers from HFTs and FAANG and don’t choose to do a masters. Your peer group, the courses and professors would be faaaar better in NITK. I would advice you to do good research under a professor in NITK and you’ll easily get into CMU.\n    └── what if 2 years down the lane you don't want to pursue masters anymore?\n        └── I am  100% sure about doing masters.",
    "I did the same and now I might jump off any minute\n├── Bruh ur a fresher how are u already so burnt out\n│   └── 0 huzz pulling capacity bruv😔😔\n└── You ditched NIT K CSE for PESt??Damn!!",

    "Well if fees is really a huge problem and you don't want to leave your home then I do recommend take pes , if those are not an issue NIT K is ok",
    "Which course in NITK? If it's not CS and you're interested in CSE, only then give PES a serious thought.\n└── I have 99.74% in the Jan jee attempt. I can get any nit cse but I can't afford fees. Pes ec cse through kcet is cheap and close to my home and the additional scholarship that they provide makes it even cheaper. My main aim is to pursue mscs from abroad and I think joining pes will help since many people have made it to cmu and other top colleges. So why spend 12L for the same btech from NITK.\n    ├── I see. I would ideally prefer NITK CSE. The NIT tag is one that will stay with you your entire life. Along with this, I'm sure the opportunities and facilities there will be much better. \n\nHowever, I can understand your reasoning behind PESU EC CSE. Living with your parents and the college being close to home(along with being cheap) can make a huge difference to your quality of life and peace of mind and within Bengaluru, it's a well-reputed college. If you want to go for PES EC CSE, you'll need to work very, very hard for the same opportunities that an NIT might provide you though, but if you're able to do well in JEE, you should be able to thrive there too. PS: PESU RR is also feasible for you if you're getting it, it's not too far if you take NICE Road.\n    │   └── Thanks for commenting. College being close and cheap are huge factors for me to join this college. I simply don't see a reason to pay 12l for the same degree at NITK.  Do you know how many actually end up going for top unis abroad. How does pes have cse avg of 17lpa while even few tier 1 nits like NIT CALICUT  don't have that kind of avgs??\n    │       └── No way does PES have 17lpa avg for CSE\n    │           ├── My bad it's actually 12lpa🥲💚. Which is still pretty good.\n    │           └── Averages can be skewed, especially because of the number of folks who joined IBM this year. Median is better.\n    │               └── according to nirf's data the median a few years back was 12lpa. Do u have any reliable sources for the average or more recent medians??? Because i dint find it on the website\n    │                   ├── There's a 2025 placements sheet but it hasn't been updated in a while.\n    │                   └── The exel sheet maintained by students says the median is 12 too\n    └── Brother take a loan \n12L is not a lot for someone who will graduate from NITk. \nBro pes grads itself endup earning 40-50 lakhs after a good amount of work experience, imagine how far NITk grads go, in the long run this money will be a blip for u. \nThe thing is 10 yrs from now u should not regret that u should have went to NITk instead of pes.\n        └── If you're getting NIT K CSE, this shouldn't be a question at all.The tag will stick with you for life and there are enough opportunities to pay the fee off with a loan.If PESU itself has median 12 lakh  NIT will prolly have 20 lakh+,added to the fact that the research that the faculties are doing will probably be much better considering the person in question wants a masters.Surprised that this is even a question. Not even\nRVCE CSE via KCET,is worth leaving NIT K for imo,let alone PES RR/ECC.",

    "If I were you, the smartest choice is going to nitk cse. If what you're worried about is fees. Then trust me, 5 lakhs for 4 years is nothing long term. If your parents have savings, this is 100% worth it. You'll earn this shit back in one month. If not, loans are very plausible and worth it in this scenario. The peer group, placements, teachers will all be better. There is no comparing PES and NITK. I wouldn't drop a whole league just to attend something thats nearby. In the grand scheme of things you could say it doesn't matter, but this will affect your quality of life for the next 4 years. You can always get an apartment if you don't want to stay in a pg or the hostel.",

    "dont just go join NIT CSE. This place is just hell. Why are you making a choice of playing your life in hard mode when god is leading you on the path of easy mode?\n└── Can you elaborate why?\n    └── Ok PES is a decentish college in bangalore but not in India. The courses in PES are hectic ,tough and just overall stressful. They will tell you have time but but you actually dont. If you are a genius who can finish portions of a subject in half /1 day  then you can live else you are just get spent/overloaded. the stress compounded with a hectic lifem is not worth for a non NIT /IIt life. choose a nit has more chances to do stuff.",
