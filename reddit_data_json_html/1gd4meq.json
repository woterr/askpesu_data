    "I know my classmates who have done their capstone in Mech + ECE. It is possible, but requires you to go through several bureaucratic hurdles (approval from both dept HODâ€™s, suitable time for presentation etc). \n\nSo to answer your question: Yes, you can do your capstone in another department but some part of it should contain what youâ€™ve learnt in your department",
    "that would be letting students explore their interests bro...ain't no way PES allowing that\nâ”œâ”€â”€ I mean they kinda expect you to pick your branch based on that but yea lmao\nâ””â”€â”€ ðŸ¥º",
    "Related to your branch only.",
    "Talk to your teachers if thats ok. But better in your own...at least you know the basics of what to do...another branch you have to learn and that might take up more time."
