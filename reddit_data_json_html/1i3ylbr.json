  "content": "Y'all so I'm in 12th rn and I want to get into PES RR campus (CSE). KCET cut off is around 1k for GM which I dont think I'm capable of (idk) and JEE mains score should be around 85 percentile or 70 marks (not official, an estimate) to go for the JEE management quota. My best bet seems like Management quota which is around 12L pa (low morale rn).   \nI might have to take an education loan. Does anyone have any opinions? Is it worth an education loan?  \nI know the placements are good (provided I have a good cgpa) but yeahh. I fall under above average category 😂 when it comes to studies  \nIts basically a gamble to take an education loan. IF..IF... I don't get a good package or a out of campus job... I'll be stuck in a debt trap. I don't plan on doing masters abroad.. atleast not yet.",

    "Damn it used to be so chill back in the day when you could be a dumbass and still get into PES thru PESSAT\n├── exactly how we did it\n│   └── Literally 🤧🤧\n└── Made it in this year was lucky that I'm the last batch of pessat\n    └── Yeah me too 🙏",
    "Even I thought the same last year but i ended up in rr cs thru cet lol\n└── what was your rank though?\n    └── Quite less than the cutoff cant reveal ofc\n        └── wait.. how'd you end up in rr tho? 😭 2nd round extended or something?",
    "Mann why do u give up so early? What makes u think that u can't score above 85 percentile or 70 marks in JEE mains? Bro u have the 2nd attempt too remember that. U have 3 whole months for that. U can score above 70 marks even without studying 50 percent of the syllabus.\nJust sit and plan accordingly.\n└── Hey! don't get me wrong buddy.. I haven't given up. I'm working everyday... I just don't feel confident. I'm not giving the JEE exam this month... its a long story tbh, I never intended to do engineering.. since I can't get my dream job.. I had to come to my second option. Besides.. its my fault that I didn't mention that the 85% thingy was just an estimate on the lower end. I'll give my everything.   \nThank you\n    └── Yea, that's the spirit. Fight till the end. Don't be bothered about colleges and counseling till ur last competitive exam ends cuz believe me u will be having plenty of time for that. Even if u have to apply for an education loan, u will have enough time to complete the paperwork. For now just keep grinding for both Kcet and Jee. ATB 👍",
    "You still have time to prepare. Why are you thinking of management quota now? Focus on your prep and upcoming entrances. Worry about comparing colleges on placements and fees later. These should be the least of your concerns right now.\n\nRegardless of the great placements and crowd, I don't think PES is worth taking an education loan to afford the fees.\n├── Hey, I've asked u a query on ur comment in the post where u suggested which kinda laptop to buy. The post has been linked in the FAQs section.\nCould you reply to that?\n│   └── Yeah cool let me see\n│       ├── Thank You for replying\n│       └── Hey!  I also have some doubts related to laptop, Would u mind checking DM?\n└── Yes, I'll give my absolute best into KCET but I don't have confidence to believe that I'll get a rank below 1000 or around 1000 to make it into PES rr. I'll be giving other private entrances, will give my first attempt of JEE in april too. I'm trying to maximize my chances of getting into a college.   \nTaking a education loan so that I don't become a burden.. this was my concern..

    "Try getting through KCET  (at least EC campus). Not worth taking an education loan for management quota or JEE mains quota. You worry about joining the college now. Don't worry about all the package thing blah blah you have time for that.\n└── Will do.. the cut off is very high..around 1k for RR and 1.8k in the EC.   \nLoan would be my last option.   \nYes..

    "nahh bro   \nits not worth the 12lakhs trust me \n\ni mean the college is good but tooo stressful \n\nif you are an average student like me this will be hell atleast thats what i felt , try through jee quota or join dsce through kcet its more chill there apparently and the college also has a decent name",
    "where'd you get the number 85%ile from?\n└── It was just an estimate from a few insider sources... mb I forgot to mention it. Sorry.  \nIt was 98.5% last year, the intake has been inc to 45% from 5% last year. So the cut off would be lower",

    "Bro its just Jan, dw abt this now. Grind for kcet and don't screw up your boards. Don't think about management this early. Focus on your exams for now and come back to this sub later, we'll help you out then.\n└── Will do, thank you. My only concern was that the management seats for cs are already 'apparently' filled... I visited the office today.. there's only cs with ai/ml available in the rr campus (management) .. I wanna do everything to get into PES... thats the only reason I even thought about management.   \nWill give my best in boards and in kcet as well.\n    └── Honestly if i were you, i'd just focus on my exams. That way even if i don't score enough to get into pes or RV thru kcet, i can at least get into some other decent college thru kcet.... and who knows, jee might save your ass too. (sometimes a lil delusion is good to keep u from giving up lol). Oh and try to do well in comedk too. I understand that writing these many exams can be overwhelming but trust me its better to keep your options open for now.\n        └── Yes, I will be writing all of them 😂 its now or never. I really want to get into PES though... thats my goal. I already am focusing on exams yo 😭 legit been grinding .. my morale was down when I posted my main comment. I still think I won't be able to get a rank below 1000 or anywhere near it. Got no idea bout JEE since idk shit (will be in delusion and grind)\n            └── Nah its alr, i get it. It's not easy to keep up the same level of hope and confidence for that 6 month stretch of entrance exams but that's no reason to give up. Power thru it lil bro.

    "No, it is not worth an education loan. I don't think it is.",
    "It's probably better to go abroad if you need to spend 12 LPA",
    "Nuh uh don't take loans for management duh. U can have it for the masters, you have a lottt of time if you can manage it for best output( i mean I got decent rank without much study but don't be an a-hole like me and study well).",
    "Also why are you sticking to PESU there are more better colleges than pes. also I think taking education loan for your btech is not a good idea. I agree that you are good at studies but placement depends on lot of factors not only your cgpa hence think before taking any such decisions also you have time to prepare ryt for now just focus on your studies. All the best 👍\n└── Thank you for sharing your opinion! I will be focusing on studies haha.. no other option, can't be a burden.   \nThere are a few reasons why I wanna join PESU alone 😂 ahh well.. long story.\n    └── Write comedk, you can get similar colleges,better rank and is way less competitive than kcet",
    "what is jee management quota.   \nthere is only one management quota. \n\nI dont think a loan is advisable ngl. Loan for jee quota is fine ig, but for management quota its a of money.   \nHow much of it are u gonna take loan?",
