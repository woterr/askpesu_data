    "Depends on how well you did your ESA ! If you are expecting above 20 you'll get E   \nECE Teachers won't show mercy if you don't deserve",
    "Can you elaborate which subject and which campus u r from???\n└── network analysis and synthesis ,ece and im from rr campus",
    "In my opinion, this seems nearly impossible, \nit should be very easy to get 20 out of 100 in an ESA \n\nI suggest u apply for reviewing your ESA paper for that subject, if u feel u deserve better then talk to your subject teacher about it and try to mail the COE via the teacher , and maybe apply for re-evaluation..since..that’s just the best u can do at this point \n\nHope this helps :)\n└── sure,thank you smm",
    "They will let u fail if u haven't written enough"
