  "content": "Hey everyone,\nI’m currently in my final year of BCA and considering MCA at PES University as one of the options for higher studies.\n\nBefore I decide, I really want to understand how the MCA placements have been over the past 3 years (or at least this year).\n\n💬 Specifically looking for:\n\t•\tAverage, median, and lowest CTC for MCA graduates\n\n\t•\tTypes of companies that recruit (service-based vs product-based)\n\n\t•\tWhether it’s really worth spending 2 years in terms of placements \n\nIf you’ve done MCA from PES, or know someone who has, please share your honest experience. Even critical feedback is appreciated — it’ll help a lot of us make smarter choices 🙏",
