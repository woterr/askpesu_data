  "content": "I'm still unclear about my career after graduating, so I thought of preparing for some of the more relevant fields in CS and have narrowed the options down to ML engineer and Data scientist. I'm not fully clear on what an ML engineer does, although it seems more research oriented and not like a typical job with a steady income, on the other, i've heard data science is becoming more obsolete because of ML. Which of the two is more feasible based on the industry today, also do recommend some other fields that you've found interesting.",
