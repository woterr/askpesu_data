    "I applied for MCA at PES last year, and I cleared the interview round and all that, but then I got to know there was a waitlist, it was WL 11 at that time, but the wired thing is, when I withdrew from the admission process I get to know not a single person surrendered a confirmed seat, I had no choice but to apply again next year. \n\nSo yeah, they overbook, and it sucks.\n└── Hey are u pursuing mca in Bangalore? I had some queries can I dm?\n    └── sure!!\n        └── hey, i have queries, can I dm you?",

    "I joined the college in management quota aiml... My parents forced me... Idk what to do... Is pes a torture house\n└── Wrong choice of branch + questionable college + superfluous fees. \n\nAll the best, you're going to need it.\n    └── Why wrong branch?\n        ├── He should have chosen cs , aiml is a kinda sketchy branch\n\nTbh,  PES isnt worth the management fee or the PESSAT fee\n\nOnly take PES if you are getting thru kcet.\n        │   └── i am getting Robotics and AI at BIT and CS-Data Science at RNSIT.

    "Wait what exactly happened ?\nWhat does overbook even mean yo ?\n└── Seats in aiml at rr : -36\n\nSuppose seats are 300, these guys admitted 400 people in the first round \n\nSo there are no seats left \n\nBasically, more admission than the number of seats\n    ├── Adding to this, the admission could have been also provided to management quota requests, thus making the count *more negative*\n    └── Any idea what's gonna happen to the 36 people ( do they have to give up their seats)?\n        └── Nah that would be shooting themselves in the foot. Their reputation will go further down.\n\nThey will most likely adjust their CET or diploma student quota.\n            └── they cant just change the cet quota right , which means they are just asking for someone to come and sue them .\n                └── Yeah, true. Honestly I really can't answer what PES is going to do from here but its a big mess\n                    └── i think since a lot of people converted from pessat to kcet quota last year , lot of empty seats were left in ec campus , that is after people got called to join rr campus cse since seats were left there too.\n\nig to avoid all this again , they overbooked so it would balance out later . lmao they screwed up ig",
