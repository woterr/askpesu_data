    "8th sem  internship is compulsory no matter how many credits u do\n└── Okayy",
    "internship credits needed to graduate are total - 6 credits.  \nso if you do one in 2nd year  summer and another in 3rd years summer, you get 4 credits.(summer is only 2 credits).  \nwhich means u still need 2 credits , so yes u need to do one more internship in 4th year(for 2 credits).\n\nHowever if u just do one internship in 4th year , you can get all 6 credits at once.\n├── For our batch (2027) we're allowed to claim 2 credits only for any one of the summers (after 4th sem or after 6th sem), not both, so we still have to do an internship in 4th year compulsorily (4/6 credits)\n│   └── Okay, thanks\n└── Okay, thanks",
    "I think you'll still be a few credits short. Each summer internship is worth 2 credits I believe.\n└── Okayy",
    "From What we were told, The 8th Sem Internship is compulsory. You can claim 2 credits in 2nd or 3rd Year intership. You can't claim 2 from each year. The minimum number of credits in the 8th sem internship is 4 credits\n└── Okayy, thanks"
