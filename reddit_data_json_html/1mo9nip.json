So any senior who have had mac, how did u work with it? Will i face any problems in 3rd or 4th year as well??\n Please answer, will be highly appreciated 👏 😩🙏\n[PS - I desperately want an mac and have been saving up for it, so please don't convince me against it😭😭]",

    "Been using the M1 air all 4 years and it carried everything without a sweat!   \nlove the machine",
    "Everything works - for CSE atleast. There are multiple workarounds which take 5-10 minutes more than the average windows user. But again the average windows user is fucking retarded, so your good to go. Plus mac is basically unix, which is a plus. \n\nAs far as linux on mac is concerned - you can use UTM or install asahi linux.\n\n  \nid suggest go for the 512gb variant, helps a lot.\n└── Ohhhh okay thanks man, yep going for 512 gb going one👏\n    └── yep cool",
    "Should u go for m4 pro rather than m4 air or air is sufficient for CSE\n└── I feel it's sufficient but if u have budget then go for the pro , it has nano textured display and stuff so yup its ur call ;)",
    "Yeah I'm buying a mac this weekend too. I'll probably just use emulators or linux for unsupported programs\n└── Oh same ,I am gonna buy this weekend. Yup u r right we can use emulators\n    └── don't rely on them more. one mistake and ur mac is gone.you can maybe borrow your roommate's laptop and do the work or labs are there\n        └── Ohhh okay thanks for the heads up🥲"
