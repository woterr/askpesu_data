    "Yes, I have been going for a few days now. The security does not say anything if you wear the temporary id.  \nWhen entering libraries, sometimes they may ask to scan it, just tell them it's temporary, and you'll get the proper one when you start your session next month.  \nFor wifi, I just took the credentials of a senior who I know; You can do this too.\n\nOr else try:  \nUsername - graviton01\n\nPassword - graviton01\n\ngraviton02 and graviton03 should work too\n\nSomeone said they were given these credentials in an old hackathon, and they still work. Haven't tried them myself, though.\n└── Ahh cool thnx alot, this was helpful .... \n    └── np, btw, if you just want to sit, avoid the libraries which have books, they will be stricter there. Security in the non-book lending libraries is pretty chill. You can try the 13th (Terrace) floor BE block one for example.\n        └── Okk",
    "yes you have access",
    "Once you get your ID card you can use it to access the library and borrow books.\n└── Can I not just sit in library and study with my own study material, is there any other place to do the same ?\n\nAnd yes I have got my college id card which is valid till September (I got it at the time of admission)\n    └── Yes you can sit in the Library"
