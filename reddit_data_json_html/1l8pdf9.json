  "content": "I’ve recently started doing LeetCode again. Back in my BCA days, I solved over 100 questions, but I’ve always struggled to stay consistent — usually giving up after 2-3 months and jumping to something else.\n\nThis time, I really want to stick with it for the next 2 years and build a strong habit. It’s been a week, and I’ve already solved 15 questions — so off to a decent start!\n\nI’m looking for a study buddy who’s on a similar journey. Someone I can solve problems with, share progress, help out, and also push each other to stay consistent.  \nI’m joining the MCA program at PES RR Campus this year\n\nIf you're interested, let’s grow together and keep each other accountable. Anyone in?",
