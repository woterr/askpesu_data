  "title": "Addressing the Rumours",
  "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI know most of you have already seen *the video*. It's been circulating for a while now, and while Iâ€™d love to clear things up with full transparency, I **wonâ€™t be posting it here** out of respect for the privacy of the individuals involved. (Yes, that includes myself. And, of course, the statue.)\n\nFor those who *somehow* havenâ€™t seen it yet, the footage in question allegedly depicts me engaging in **inappropriate** behavior with the Doreswamy statue in GJB, up the ramp. Let me address these rumors head-on:\n\nI was **not** engaging in any sort of *intimate*, *romantic*, or *otherwise questionable* activity with the statue. What you saw was **a structural integrity assessment**â€”nothing more. As a concerned member of the PES student body, I felt it was my duty to ensure that our statues are well-maintained and structurally sound. If my methods appeared... *thorough*, that is simply a testament to my commitment to the cause.\n\nNow, I understand that **certain angles** of the video, combined with my **unfortunate choice of hand placement**, may have led to some misunderstandings. I also acknowledge that my **facial expressions** (which were purely those of deep concentration) may have been misinterpreted. However, I **categorically deny** any allegations that this was an act of *passionate engagement* with the statue.\n\nSome of you have even suggested that this was **not** an isolated incident. Let me be perfectly clear: Any claims that I have been seen **visiting the statue at odd hours** are **completely unsubstantiated**. The idea that I was there on **Tuesday at 2:34 AM** is absurd, and frankly, I donâ€™t know why anyone would even bring up such a specific time.\n\nMoving forward, I will be conducting all future statue assessments **from a respectful distance** to avoid any further controversy. I hope this post clears up any misconceptions.\n\nThat said, I would *deeply appreciate* if people could stop making false allegations regarding my relationship with this 1 year old statue. Some of you are too creative, and it's getting out of hand\n\nSincerely,  \nyour friendly neighborhood statue inspector",
