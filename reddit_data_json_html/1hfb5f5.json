    "I don’t know if they changed the process, but back in my day, it was a fully screwed up process where we had to go online, file a lost and found report and obtain an FIR, and then submit that FIR to the office and pay some money for them to issue a new card. \n\nWasn’t fun losing my ID card for sure. Hope the process is changed now. Good luck to your “friend”\n└── Thanks for the info.....\nbtw which year ru referring to???\n    └── I remember losing my ID card in 2018, so some years back\n        └── Ohhkkk...thanks again",
    "Ask in ur dept office about it, they will tell, from what ik u need to file fir, pay 400-500 and then fill form\n└── Kk..thanks",
    "Step one: Don't lose it.\n\nStep 2: Go to ur HOD and inform. They'll tell what to do next. \n\nStep 3: Don't lose it...the second time round cause the security sometimes ask about it. And it gets you access to places.\n└── Thank u🙏🏻"
