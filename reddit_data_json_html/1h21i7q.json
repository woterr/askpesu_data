    "I was a TA in my 7th semester (Aug-Dec 2021). Got paid for it after my full time began around August 2022 lmao\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Even i did in aug-dec 2023 still didnâ€™t get paid\nâ””â”€â”€ If you dont mind answering \nHow much do TA's get paid,\nIs it diff for diff profs\n    â”œâ”€â”€ Yeah, different for different courses and profs, as well as the amount of work done.\n    â””â”€â”€ Thats peanuts!\nIts very less like cant even say :)\n        â””â”€â”€ Can't generalise. We got paid almost 10k back then. But I do know some RAs who got paid as low as 2k.",
    "No not yetðŸ˜­\nâ”œâ”€â”€ FYI was a TA from Jan - May 2024\nâ””â”€â”€ ðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒ",
    "Also could seniors add info related to becoming a TA.\n\n1.How do you approach the professor?\n2.Is it manageable workload considering placements, capstone,classes(online)?\n3.Is it worth the workload, what value does it add?\n4.How was your experience working under the professors,does it build a very good rapport or is it just limited to getting the work done?\n5.Any general suggestions\nâ””â”€â”€ I think the FAQs (and if not the FAQs, search this subreddit) answer all of these. They're answered by me only in the past\n    â””â”€â”€ Oh sry, I'll check that, thank you!",
    "Abroad we get paid. Here not so much...\nâ””â”€â”€ Yea true!\nTill now i havenâ€™t been paid.",
    "Does only CSE have TAs or even ECE ?\nâ””â”€â”€ No idea",
    "is it possible to bribe TA anonymously, give them some cash and increase assignment marks?\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Idk never heard of anything like thisâ€¦\nâ””â”€â”€ It wouldn't work well for you if caught."
