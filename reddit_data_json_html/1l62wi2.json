    "The rule is no **active** backlogs. It does not matter if you had a backlog in a previous semester; you will be eligible for placements as long as you have cleared it.\n└── Adding to this , some companies do allow you to sit even if you have backlog. its very less number of companies and mostly they are t2 or t3 but yes they do exist.",
    "It's not like that. There are some companies which set the criteria of 'NO HISTORY OF BACKLOGS'. But that's very few."
