    "Aiml in ec campus basically a participation trophy\n├── 😂\n└── Unless you willingly opt for it(much like me💀💀💀)\n\nTbf I want to continue with masters in the same field",
    "Is there any news about KCET cutoff for CSE / AIML?\n└── Only slight increase due to bms seat increase it ended at 1.7k this year",
    "I think now they want some more “reputation” thats why they didn’t convert pessat seats to management seats, also they’re gonna accept only jee mains/kcet, so thats also a point.",
    "lol I'm  2025 batch ,in pessat that yr ec campus cse used to close at 2k change. Ig cutoffs have taken a drastic drop because of the the intake increase and fees . Ofc it will affect the quality of students. Just because the college increase their intake doesn't mean the companies will hire more than usual , that depends on the job market and basic demand supply. So yes it will definitely affect placements stats atleast percentage placed wise.\n└── Fr 2026 batch here, our batch has 720 CSE + 180 Aiml + 720 CSE (EC campus) ngl the pressure for 2025 internships is real pain,feels like a race bcz of leetcode!",
    "What was the cutoff for ece in RR campus?",
    "I doubt it's that big of a deal since they're discontinuing PESSAT",
    "Even I feel it is a major concern\n├── As bms have drastically increased the seats it's cutoffs have increased and ig many people joining pes cs through pessat now get bms cs through kcet which is way more worth it considering the cost and a nearly equal college\n│   └── or is it possible that they chose pes ec through kcet because of the fees? hence they left the rr cse seats.\n│       └── That even last year they might have taken and ec campus cutoff is nearly the same through cet only bms has increased drastically\n└── Kcet and jee quota has not changed, plus number of seats increased in lots of colleges so that night have effected it.\n    └── Yeah in kcet mild increase happened due to rv ece and bms cs seats increase"
