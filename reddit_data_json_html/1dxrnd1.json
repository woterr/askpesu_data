    "Bro 1st year is a great time to keep CGPA high. The hardness will increase exponentially as sems go up. But still if u plan correctly and do enough hard work yes u can improve.\nâ””â”€â”€ Welp I still got good grades in comp and EPD , improved at math I just did really bad cus of subjects like physics , eee. So I am coping rn saying I am finally done with non cs subjects so I'll improve if I put in the hours.\n    â””â”€â”€ Does the first year require us to have a grasp of 11th and 12th concepts of Chem and Physics and Maths?\n        â””â”€â”€ Not much but don't come in with 0 recollection of facts either. For Maths, just remember calculus basics.",
