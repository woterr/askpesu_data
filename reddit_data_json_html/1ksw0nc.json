    "yes but you'll have to work extra hard early on, try to maintain a good cgpa, if you're able to manage cgpa then enroll in minor courses for other subjects too, as a lot of the good placements tend to go to those who tried to take up a job in a field they did a minor in, and try to maintain a decent network with your professors and seniors in your field\n\nmedian placements arent really AMAZING in pesu for eee, but if you're able to stand out from the crowd in some meaningful way, you can probably do really well after graduation",
