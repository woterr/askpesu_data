    "Its not only the extra money, u have to stay in patiala for 4 years vs Bengaluru.\nThat along with extra fees would be a deal breaker for me.\nAlso check if hostel fees are different.\nAlso hostel life is a bit mid here idk how it's in thapar tho.\nâ””â”€â”€ Thapar campus and hostels r insanely good...but then again why should I spend 6-7lacs more for thatðŸ˜­I guess PES would be the better choice",
    "I mean if you can spare the money, then Thapar fs. Those 7 lacks is the difference between amazing campus life and a shit campus life\nâ””â”€â”€ I understand...but for some reason I can't comprehend 7 lacs for campus lifeðŸ’€\n    â””â”€â”€ Its 4 years of your life, your final years without responsibilities. I get that 7 lacks is not a small amount of money and it can be kinda hard to justify. Either ways the choice is yours"
