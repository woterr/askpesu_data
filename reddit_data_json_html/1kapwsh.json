    "I still wonder what made PESU keep CN as a freaking 5 cred course when most of the faculty literally slacks off.  \nThey don't provide any notes/good slides/MCQs nothing.",
    "Firstly, jim kurose doesn't work at mit. \n\nAnd second, the videos of him presenting them are free on youtube\n└── Mb but besides the point unit 3 slides if they just put up Jim Kurose slides how can anyone understand. Later figured he has free yt lectures. And av summaries are teams presentation with the bloke teaching while showing a piece of paper from his phone.\n    └── Wdym unit 3, all slides are his. All units. Did they change that now?\n\nI'm not saying pes is giving us perfect materials, but you should've figured this out",
