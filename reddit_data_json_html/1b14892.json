    "&gt;There was nothing mentioned about branch prediction on pesu\n\nBruh have you even gone thru the slides?\n└── Yeah but it wasn't taught in our class and moreover no solved example was there\n    └── Bruh just open the anchor slides , there's a solved example for each and every case\n        └── No bruh it's not there\n            └── It's not thereeee !",
    "Fuck MPCA, now I fucking hate that subject. This shit partially feels like 1st sem physics (in the sense the course might be structured really bad). MPCA course itself is so fucking hard in which it takes so much time for me to understand a single concept.\n├── Hey i don't think so that the subject is difficult it's really easy just that the questions asked were horrible\n│   └── Ah yes, the questions are so retarded. Whoever made the questions might've been retarded. I'm calling them retarded because they don't understand our struggle and I find MPCA to be very confusing. That entire course itself is very confusing and difficult for me. So pesu academy will never help because slides and notes themselves are not proper.\n└── Full form of MPCA?\n    └── It's a course in 4th sem CS. It's called a microprocessor and computer architecture.\n        └── Thanks!"
