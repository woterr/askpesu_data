    "[clubs.pes.edu](http://clubs.pes.edu) isn't the most accurate website for looking up clubs since it is not updated frequently. The best source is to ask seniors.\n└── Hmm",
    "I dont think we have any currently, Maybe you can start a new finance club? Talk with HOD about it\n└── I'm in the first year, should I talk to the HOD of S and H?\n    ├── U can work with seniors to revive it.\n    └── no department HOD handle all this",
    "There's a finance club but it's a \"bba club\" not a university wide club.",
    "No clubs per say but there are events and hackathons for sure, stock market and trading hackathons, business proposal , auction related events and some other events are conducted every sem by management and commerce departments, its open for all.\n└── Oh damn okayy",
    "I heard there used to be a trading club until last year but I think its not there anymore\n└── Ohk"
