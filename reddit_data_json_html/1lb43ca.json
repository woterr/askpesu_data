    "A total of 25% can have scholarship. Only 5% constitutes of MRD and the remaining 20% of CNR\n└── Also what would be the base cutoff ? 8.5?\n    └── That's the minimum to be eligible. But 8.5 doesn't guarantee you a scholarship.\n        └── Yeah so 8.5 is minimum and then they take the top 25% for scholarships\n            └── yeah"
