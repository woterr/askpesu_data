    "First and second sem initially I did get lower grades, somehow managed to get it back on track once we switched to the proper streams as that was what I liked studying\nBut the effect those first 2 sem grades have shouldnt be taken lightly as they are credit packed and unless you do exceptionally well in the coming years its hard to maintain like a 8.5",
    "Yeah not in 2nd sem ,even worse in 3rd sem and finally in 4rth sem .One learning - \nLearn with your friends ,teach and question them and definitely solve textbook questions for harder subjects  ,slides aren't gonna cut it.\n\nComeback will only happen when you truly integrate the concept within yourself and remember them also (for exams)",
    "Imo most of the students do make a comeback after theyâ€™re familiar with ISAs and ESAsâ€¦I personally scored very low during my first sem and it made me realise that the only change I had to make was study regularly ðŸ˜…â€¦ The days I couldnâ€™t catch up, I made sure i completed it during the weekends.. basically itâ€™s a no big deal..",
    "Do your best in first sem, spoonfeeding you anything regarding studies stops after first year, everything is on ur own, make use of the spoonfeeding in 1st year and get good gpa",

    "3.9 CGPA to 6.9 cgpa with placement offer",
    "Sorry babu",
    "8.91 to 9.91 felt pretty good\nâ””â”€â”€ How is it a \"comeback\" if you started off with ~9 CGPA xD\n\nAnyway, that's great stuff man &lt;3\n    â”œâ”€â”€ Yeah tbh lol\n    â””â”€â”€ dude 9 to 10 is a comeback in its own sense",
