    "which canteen specifically? Gonna avoid it.\n└── The second one amongst the BE block stalls. Found that roach in the sauce. Really avoid it ya'll\n    ├── really hate that fucker\n    ├── Did you report it to him? One of the guys working there has a real bad attitude lmao\n    └── wait is this the one that sells chicken roll and paneer roll?",
    "\n\nIs it the 2nd shop infront on B block ?\n\nEven if it's not, do avoid that shop. He sells stale food😵‍💫",
    "which canteen???",
    "Looks like one of the BE block canteens",
    "Is it from the BE Block stalls?",
    "Please use a spoiler tag from next time.\n\nAlso damn, PES really wants people to work on their daily protein intake",
    "Wow, when did they start non veg samosa 🕵️",
    "Extra protein",
    "Extra protein. jk.\n\nWhy is everyone asking which canteen as if only that particular canteen serves samosaroach. If it wasn't in your samosa then it would've ended in others plate. Better try minimising the consumption from outside all together.",
    "Yummers ",
    "would be nice if you mentioned the canteen",
    "Taste kaha hai? Taste yahan hai",
    "Iski samosa m alloo yeh kya hai bc 💀",
    "Is this the same stall that sells shawarma?",
    "Was it tasty??\n└── Even without that roach, it was measly 3/10. The filling was jackshit nothing more than just ginger paste and mashed potato.",
    "So cool that's why it's famous",
    "🤮😭😭",
    "He doesn't even microwave them properly. Not that it matters with a whole ass worm inside",
    "Baked ones are arguably better than deep fried. You need to let them know we deserve better!",
