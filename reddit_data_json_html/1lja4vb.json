    "There is a main PESU Discord server, and a separate server for your batch. There is also a WhatsApp group for your entire batch. I do not think there is a specific campus+branch group, but I could be wrong. WhatsApp group links are banned on this subreddit, ask on PESU Discord and someone will direct you, or find the post, it can easily be searched on the incoming student channels."
