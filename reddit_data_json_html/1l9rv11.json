But then everyone has their own priorities.\nâ”‚       â”‚           â””â”€â”€ I have pretty good interest in both the streams and was okay with taking either of them which is why I picked the campus over the stream, I am also lucky enough to have actually gotten CSE in RR, I should've phrased my initial reply better to reflect that\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ Ur changing ur career over a fancier campus ðŸ˜­?\nâ”‚           â””â”€â”€ I should've phrased it better to reflect that I would make that choice if I had to, I am a CSE student in RR but I am also really interested in ECE so I wouldn't have minded taking that as my course in RR over EC and ECC is also a huge problem for travel for me personally which again would not make it practical for me to have had taken up\nâ””â”€â”€ Som ppl select college based on distance if that is an option",
