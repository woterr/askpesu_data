  "content": "One of the seniors mentioned that they had options to choose from for their 2-credit courses. But we just had the CIE orientation last week, which I think was common for everyone. We haven’t received any circular regarding course options yet. Does this mean we’ll only have CIE, or is PESU just delaying it?",
