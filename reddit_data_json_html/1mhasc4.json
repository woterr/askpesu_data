    "You can still do it in 6th sem (Summer internship) and 8th (regular internship). Relax. You have good chances to get internship during 6th sem. So be ready.\n└── do students do internships after 4th sem usually?\n    └── Yes.",
    "Don't worry you can do an internship during 8th sem also; You can do a 4 month internship in 8th and get all the credits.\nThe market situation is not so good, you will get less number of companies hiring for summer interns; They will come mostly during 6th.\n└── Is that the norm? How long do most people do the internship for in the 8th sem?\n    └── Most people who get fte+internship will have to do it for 6 months during the 8th sem even if you have done the summer internship (as most companies want you to work for 6 month with them).\nThe norm is you can earn internship credit in 2 ways, 2+6 or 0+8.\n        └── Tysm man",
    "Some good companies like JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, DE Shaw, hire for 6th sem summer internship around 4th sem itself. Keep an eye out for those. They usually have a very small registration window (&lt;1 day sometimes)\n\nPeople usually aren't very serious about DSA, system design, etc during this time so the competition is lesser.",
