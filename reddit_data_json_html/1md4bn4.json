    "I think one massive thing that's missed while calculating placement % is that many people hold multiple offers in different tiers.\nâ””â”€â”€ Ik but that adjusted also gives a decent %age placed cuz more people get tier 1 job offers so mostly they don't try any more hence %age placed would only change by many be -(3-5)%",
    "Ps- many of the seniors got ppo from apple I researched it on LinkedIn\nâ””â”€â”€ ALL of them(20) got PPO , 1 guy did not accept , as he had a better FTE offer.\n    â””â”€â”€ Damm better fte than apple ðŸ˜±",

Did Other clgs placements also suffer?\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Wait is this of all branches? Then it would make sense\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ All branch + ppos aren't incl in this if they were incl it would be higher / placement %age would also be higher if they were incl + off campus isn't incl\nâ””â”€â”€ Market is also kinda bad rn",
