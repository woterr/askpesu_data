    "No need to go to campus at all for classes. Only need to go for capstone and exams and placements\nâ””â”€â”€ How often is that? \n\nLike i know it'll be none if i don't go, but just generally to get a rough idea of the frequency\n    â””â”€â”€ Isa 1 - 2 or 3 times\n\nIsa 2 - 2 or 3 times \n\nEsa - 2 or 3 times\n\nCapstone - 4 reviews \n\nPlacements depends on u\n        â”œâ”€â”€ Dude the only thing I wanted to know about was placements ðŸ˜­. \n\nSay I've got an 8.5 gpa, and apply for every company under the sun, how often would I need to go. And are the OAs generally online, or in the assessment center\n        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Prob twice to thrice in the initial weeks\n        â””â”€â”€ What do you mean 4 reviews for capstone?Is it not 2 like 5th and 6th sem?\n            â””â”€â”€ I mean we had 4 in 6th sem as well so might be different for u guys"
