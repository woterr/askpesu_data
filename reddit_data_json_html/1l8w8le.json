    "We have semester wise Mini projects for semster courses.  \nWe also have a Capstone Project , which is a Big project component of your course starting from 5th sem.\n└── Can you elaborate a bit about mini projects a bit please\n    └── They are course oriented projects. In general you make groups of 2 to 4(based on the course instructions) and work on a project related to the course during the semester.  \nDifferent courses have different levels of project difficulties,scopes etc.\n        └── oh ok thank you"
