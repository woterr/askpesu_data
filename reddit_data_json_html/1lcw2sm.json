    "No income is required if you're GM, over ₹12 LPA, and claiming a normal merit seat..just proceed with counselling using your KCET application, 10th n 12th marksheets, study certificates, and other standard documents..income isn’t required unless you're aiming for quotas or concessions.",
    "Its not compulsory (for GM), if you are having any quota like SNQ or something. Then you ll need it."
