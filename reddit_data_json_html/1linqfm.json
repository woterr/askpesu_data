    "irrespective of the difficulty, all of us still study 1 night before the exam.  \nthis is your canon event, I shall not interfere",
    "Depends on u tbh.. I tried studying 1 day before exam in 1st sem... absolute shit show\nIn 2nd sem I started reading like 2 weeks before exam and my marks are way way better than 1st sem\nBut in the end it depends on u.. my friends who don't even read the day before exam also get decent marks so.. your wish",
    "I recommend finishing the syllabus for the test before the exams even begin, if that takes you just 2 weeks, so be it. Time isn't important, having a layer of the full syllabus already in your head before exams begin is important",
    "Getting a 9 cgpa in first year is not that hard. Pay attention in class and get ur concepts cleared. U need not study daily. Starting around 2 weeks before exam should be fine.",
    "This is josh, josh started studying the day of exam, Don't be like josh",
    "Study in class and make sure you cover the harder concepts before your exams begin so that you won't spend too much time learning them 1 day before exam (pro tip)",
    "js lock in gng"
