    "It's one of the easier and logic focused courses in the entire 4 years. Put some effort and you should get it. Just search each topic on YouTube and you should get more than enough videos explaining everything. \n\nGood luck\n└── Thank dude\nWill give this a shot\n    └── Adding to it, ensure you actually understand concepts and do not memorise. It will simply come back to bite you later.\n\nDAA forms the basis for your placement prep and is crucial to getting a good job.\n        └── would you recommend reading the prescribed textbook for this course? or would youtube videos and slides be better?\n            ├── Not sure. I didn't really use the textbook for DAA although the prescribed book is amazing. I primarily listened in class and practiced questions online.\n            └── Do anything that helps you understand the topic, it's sort of like maths. Once you start getting it, you've won."
