    "There is no specific way to study\nJust learn what you are learning properly and don’t cheat yourself\nIf yk that you studied all the subjects according to the syllabus and you can write the test w/o any issue you’ll be good\nAs per subject wise, my opinion for each subjects are like this :\nMath 1 and 2 : DO CLASSWORK problems 100% dont leave a single question also\nand if you have enough time do the question banks and assignments given by the teachers or pesuacademy\n\nPython and C : The slides aren’t really helpful, most of them have incomplete information\nKnow the syllabus and watch respective yt videos on whatever yt channel you feel comfortable with\n\nEPD : Slides are godly, do them and after that do pyqs \n\nEEE : This subject is like mostly numericals, do the ones in slides and in pesuacademy\n\nPhysics : Faisal slides &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\ndont leave a page also, do everything. God knows which corner they will ask a question\n\nChemistry : Slides from revu are pretty chill\nand numericals also in question bank and pyq are enough, cuz they mostly repeat the questions \n\nMechanical : Theres no other way than those slides, sooooo much theory and numericals also they wont change value also\n\nMechanics - Statics : Theres a list of questions that are to be solved, solve those and its enough\n\n\nFor references use my notes also : \nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IjaGpr_ad-KW2g9wl06h0rULCXOGcAN1\n├── Thank you,Where can we find previous year papers\n└── Can u pls share the list of q that is need to be solved for mechanics",
