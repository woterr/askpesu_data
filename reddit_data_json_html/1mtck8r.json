    "6.9 is quite low, not sure how many core companies hire with such low GPA, but anyway, check placement sheet for that. GPA is important for getting into core companies \n\nWhether you want to shift to IT, is in your interest. If you really like CS, you can shift to IT, take CSE Minors, although it does no guarantee a software due to reasons as mentioned in FAQs, but it does help. \n\nGood luck !\nâ””â”€â”€ Thanks, Can i dm\n    â””â”€â”€ Sure\n        â””â”€â”€ Unable to dm\n            â””â”€â”€ shot you a DM !"
