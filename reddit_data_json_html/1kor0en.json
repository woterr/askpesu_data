    "Yeah, I'm in AIML and even I think they did the Cs kids dirty lol. Our papers weren't easy (or atleast I didn't think they were) but they were certainly doable. They were also very in line with the pyqs, so historically speaking, our papers this year was what the standard used to be. Dk why they suddenly made it unreasonably tough this time 🤡",
    "Technically CSE HOD should make sure we are given paper on the same level as AIML guys, but well what can we as students really do?   \nIt makes no sense but you cant do anything with such incompetant peeps.\n└── Nah, they'd rather lecture us while praising the AIML kids as better students just because of their inflated GPA\n    └── Man our dept is beyond useless.   \nI heard from AIML friends that their HOD is actually doing some work to help their dept and here we are just sitting ducks smh\n        └── They'd definitely want to show a good placement record so expect that",
    "Moreover, after you see them correcting our paper using some ChatGPT answer key, you will lose hope over whatever you have studied till date. (Basically, you will feel useless about your efforts)",
    "It’s not only you even 6th sem\n├── do cse and aiml students have the same syllabus in 6th sem, also how many electives do cse and aiml have in common in 6th and 7th sem\n│   └── Compiler design (4 credit) and cloud computing (5 credit) are same for both AIML and cse like CN and OS in 4th the only core subject  change is Deep learning for AIML and \"Object Oriented Analysis and Design\" for CSE you can choose any elective from CSE ( i think so) not the other way CSE can't opt for AIML electives\n│       └── will the slides and notes also be the same for both cse and aiml for common subjects?\n│           └── Yeah\n└── lol ok",
    "Forget about CN ESA most of the time even for ISA they get chill papers compared to us. It's been like this from sem 3.If they are going to sit to placements with us it should be fair.This is a whole another level of discrimination \nSome AIML peeps may defend this but those who actually know how cs papers have been compared to theirs, they definitely know how it was for them vs us\n\nIm sure nothing will change unless we actually make the department know abt this,else we will again suffer for next 2 sems with low ass gpas\n\nIm not telling AIML ppl should also get hard papers,my point is both of them should get the same level of difficulty",
    "Lol can't help it bro \nAccept it and move on\nAshte brother\n└── True but we can't get off from the fact that we will be screwed when companies set initial cutoffs for placements\n    └── Right I understand that but we can't help it :(\n        └── i mean making a it a point would atleast reduce unfair discrimination in upcoming papers rather than doing nothing.. and accepting",
    "Then in that case idts we can compare the CGPA of 2 CS students also unless they were in the same cycle in first year... for eg: chem cycle ESA's were slightly harder than Phy cycle in sem1...\n└── That'd get normalised when you go to the other cycle\n    └── Yes... and also if it was harder they would apply relative grading enough to make any two cgpa's from any branch(CS,CS-AIML,ECE) comparable ig\n        └── Nope.\n\nIf you're still in your first year, you probably won't relate to this.\nThe difficulty of the papers and the bias in marking are so skewed that it's clearly visible.\n\nIt really comes down to the effort put in vs. the GPA you get.\nBeing in AIML easily gives you a GPA boost compared to what a typical CSE student would get.",
    "I'm from AIML and you're right it's pretty wild we got a copy paste paper. But it's not \"easy\" for us either. I've seen this multiple times in 3rd sem and now— whenever we get a tough paper for a subject, it's comparatively easier for you and when we get an easy one, it's comparatively harder for you. Also idk what others have to say but we don't get any special treatment or important questions before exams\n└── correct",
    "I don’t really agree with this, tbh. When we don’t study properly or feel unprepared, it *always* seems like others got an easier paper. It’s more of a mindset than actual fact. If you ask AIML folks, they’ll probably say  **CSE** papers looked easier to them too — it’s all about perspective.\n\nAlso, about the CN paper — not everyone even knew it was from last year’s ESA. And even if some questions were recycled, the paper was **challenging ... lengthy too..** not a free GPA boost. This semester’s ISAs weren’t exactly easy for us either. Every stream has its own struggles. Instead of comparing, let’s just focus on doing our best 🤝",
    "It even happened last year they got real high gpas and we got shit ones, in aiml they even get some questions right before as important",
    "Does anyone know who set the cse and aiml paper??",
    "I understand AIML got a recycled paper but just think to yourself, out of 500 kids in AIML, how many would open digital library with login creds and do that specific 2024 qp and go for the exam, not all 500 right?\n\nAlso, our CN ISAs were insanely hard and application based, idk how it was for CSE kids but me being a 9+ cg student struggled with that paper.\n\nIt's all relative for a course in the end because if you check your isa graphs, the graph is for every stream taking that course may it be cse or aiml.\n\nFrom whatever I've analysed, In 3rd sem, we had very hard application based papers for 4 credit courses and chill papers for 5 credit courses, and CSE had the opposite, so I think they know what they're doing. Never have I ever agreed with the difficulty on a subject's paper with a cse friend, mutually exclusive difficulty all the time\n├── it's not about who bothered checking last year’s paper, the issue is that you guys literally got a recycled paper when we got a much harder one. And this has been a consistent pattern since the 3rd sem so I dare say it isn't a coincidence.\n\n\nYou’re right about the relative grading part, but it’s ridiculous to make one branch’s paper significantly harder in the first place.\n\nImagine slogging through shitass subjects like CN and MPCA for days, forcing yourself to study crap that makes you question your existence, only to be rewarded with a paper so shitty even the toppers come out clueless. We walk out of nearly every single exam disappointed and demoralized, it's fucking exhausting.\n│   └── The recycled paper was available in the last 2 days only, our ISAs were horrendous, they fucked up 40% of our grade and gave us a chance in the 50%\n│       └── They didn't even give us a chance in the 50%😭\n└── It’s like all the shit u read is soooo useless in front of the actual paper\nFor CN this time , it was sooo very appln based , some questions genuinely had nothing to do with what we read in slides\nHow do u expect us to know all that??😭",
