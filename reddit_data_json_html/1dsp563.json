    "No need, a guy used to make notes in class on ipad in our 1st year and people including teachers gave pretty bad looks to him and apart from that also no need\n└── Wow that's brutal. I won't pick it up now.",
    "Do ipads have special features that u can use to make diagrams and visualisations or smt\n\n\nCoz u can use a pc/phone / physical notes\n├── If you want to pass engineering then use paper and pencil.\n└── I have no idea of that but I have heard that ipad is preferable for notes making\n    ├── Just use a pen and paper when necessary. An iPad won't improve anything\n    │   └── Alright!\n    └── There's an app called GoodNotes which is predominantly used by medical students. They have a lot of features that make the notes look visually appealing and help with memorising. That's why they buy iPads.\n\nFor CSE, all of us passed by watching YouTube videos to understand and apply the concepts. So save your money✌🏻 (ideally by not coming to PES in the first place 🤣)\n        └── I'm happy that I came thru kcet cos it saved me a lot of money but ye ipad notes does seem aesthetically pleasing hence why😃\nBtw when did you pass out?\n            └── Ah CET means it's fine. 2018-22 batch pass out, so 2 years ago\n                └── Ohh nice. Were online classes horrible or manageable?\n                    └── Straying away from this thread so DM and I'll help you out with any questions",
    "iPad is just overhyped. I would prefer making physical notes that’s wt I did. Few of my friends took it n all they did is binge watch, im not telling u would do that but i did not find it really useful.\n├── Ye ipad shouldn't become YouTube or Netflix machine.. I'll go with paper and pen\n└── Good !! \nTrust me slowly ull start enjoying making notes",
    "bro barely anyone writes notes , the content on pesuacademy combined with some youtube vids is enough for all the exams\n└── You are right but I think with notes is important and I understood ipad is not useful",
    "If you really want to organise notes, just use notion or obsidian app\n└── Yes I'm using notion for noteskeeping.\n    └── Cool, same here and I don't think you should buy an Ipad(waste of money) imo. Its still upto you tho if you badly want it go for it.\n        └── Nah I think I'm good with my laptop for notes making and iPads are indeed very costly"
