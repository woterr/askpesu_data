    "They generally release a form, few months before the PESU I/O courses start off. So then u can apply with a topic u are interested. you are to teach something simple only, not very complicated stuff as 1st year ppl may also attend ur class. \n\nand then they conduct 2 rounds of interview, after which a photo-shoot will be done and u will be allowed in"
