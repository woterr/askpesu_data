    "Airtel works better\nUse cloudwarp 1.1.1.1 vpn to access everything\nâ””â”€â”€ Bro they've blocked it .....",
    "Jio works better \nBut lowkey both are bad \nConnectivity in that area is bad \nYall just have to rely on WiFi\nâ””â”€â”€ How to access the blocked sites? And they ainâ€™t handing out wifi passwords until unless we get our ID CARD\n    â”œâ”€â”€ They gave us the WiFi passwords on the first day itself \nIdk why they are doing it differently now \nAs for the blocked sites we either used VPN or in the internet captive portal we used \nAdmin username and password \nWhich used to work back then \nI think they took it down now\n    â””â”€â”€ Dm for an insane tip.\n        â”œâ”€â”€ Heyy, mind giving me the tip too plejðŸ¥¹\n        â””â”€â”€ Yo ,can you share it with me too",
