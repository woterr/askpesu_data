    "I mean guys sure the upper management is really messed up and only address students to advertise their college but please there’s better ways to get solutions than this…. Please take care of your health",
    "Given that there is no other information available, I want to request everyone to not comment about the management, faculty etc before things are clear. Lets not point fingers before we have a clearer picture. All it does is brew a constant resentment against the University.\n└── \"PRIDE OF PESU\" yeah sure\n    └── He got that flair because he's helped thousands of students understand and go through PES. Shut up clown. ",
    "ngl this college is prolly responsible for it. How is it that it's ALWAYS PES?\n└── It's most likely due to the height of the buildings\n    └── Not really, even BMSCE has multiple 7 floor building, but we don't see those there ..",
    "Hey, any update? As to which year, and reason if known ?\n└── making rounds that its a first year guy , but not confirmed tho",

    "How messed up does a university need to be for bba students to take this step\n├── &gt;for bba students to take this step\n\nTheir degree is irrelevant in this situation.\n└── With this naive comment I am certain you are a first year, let me open your eyes, no course in the world is easy, you were thaught that commerce kids were dumb when u were in 10th guess what CA is one of the hardest exams in india probably right after upsc\nNo course is a cake walk so mentioning that to sound relevant is really a low move\nFyi I am a engineering student so I am not really defending my course or something\n    └── Fair enough i take that back",

    "It's kinda wild how someone can throw around mean comments left and right, but then gets all shaken up over hearing about a suicide. This isn't just a bit of irony; it's a huge red flag for how fragile and vulnerable they actually are deep down, hiding behind all that tough talk. It really shows a serious lack of empathy, not getting how damaging their words can be until something drastic happens. This should be a massive reality check, a moment to hit pause and think hard about changing. Learning to weigh our words and actually giving a damn about others isn't being soft; it's leveling up as a human.\n└── We'll it's reddit , so no body gives a rats ass what you speak here that's the whole point of your identity being hidden .\n    └── Just making it transparent who you are\nBehind whatever identity you choose. \nAt the end of the day you are a person and if you feel\nOkay being who you are, then it’s all good, but we both know you go to bed unhappy. Get some help.\n\nAlso you are very predictable so save yourself time bothering to respond\n        └── What even is your problem 😂, like what relation do you even have with this post ffs , get a life man , no wonder so many people cry about joblessness in India\n            └── Will do :) ⏰\n                └── 🐸"
