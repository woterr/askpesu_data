  "title": "[Question] Placement worries from a 3rd year student with low GPA",
  "content": "Hi, I currently have CG around 7.3 and in probably my most ideal 3rd year I can end up with a 7.8   \nI have noticed most people's GPA drops during this year due to various reasons and in many cases I've seen consistent people fall below 8, what happens to their placements? If they were chilling above 8 and then suddenly the 6th sem causes CG to fall to like 7.9 does it have major effects on their shortlisting or are there cutoffs at different points like 7.8 or 7.9?\n\nI do understand that internally after cutoff they will sort by GPA for shortlisting so either ways pushing your gpa even after a common cutoff is going to be helpful, just that I'm really nervous that not being above 8 will lead me to not being placed at all.\n\nFor people with CGPA around 7.5–7.8, what were your placement outcomes and which companies were you eligible for?",

    "Placements are purely \nLuck&gt;CGPA&gt;Skills \n\nIf you are below 8 Gpa \nIt’s not that you won’t get placed but it will be hard\n└── does hard mean an eventual placement if there is consistent effort on factors in my control like DSA-prep? Tier 1 or 2 either works for me.\n\nWhen you say it's hard you mean I have to be patient or that I'll mostly just have to go non-campus route?\n    └── Hard implies luck imo.\nI had a friend who had a 7+ gpa and got placed in August itself, while a friend of mine who had a 8.8 gpa got placed in Jan - Feb next year.\n\nJust hope you are lucky and get placed.\n\nAlso if you get an offer just take it.",
    "As someone in that position,\n\nI won’t say that things are rosy and sunshine,you will have trouble,lots of people just have the competitive edge over you.You had your chance to work hard and this is the best you’ve got.All you can hope for is luck and to do your best with what you can.\n\nThere really isn’t a point for you to think whether you’ll get placed or not,do your dsa,get your gpa up,do meaningful projects and network well.\n\nCgpa is usually 75% of the battle with placements and that’s just the harsh reality you’ve got to accept.\n\nI think the 4th years have had about 16 companies so far and only 2 have shortlisted students below 8 for an OA.Thats enough to put it into perspective for you.\n├── Why you getting down voted lol , rn they shortlisting 8+,8.5 as of now\n│   └── Can you please be more clear with stats?\n└── so from what I understand, under 8 an off-campus approach becomes something you HAVE to look into.\n\nOn an average what percentage of people do you think end up getting placed through college placements with a GPA around 7.5-7.8?\n\n&gt;There really isn’t a point for you to think whether you’ll get placed or not,do your dsa,get your gpa up,do meaningful projects and network well.\n\ndo you mean that in a \"fuck it what's the point thinking about it\" or in a \"you'll get placed don't worry\" way",
    "I’d say looking off campus would definitely be a plus,tier 1 opportunities might be really hard for you on campus.\n\nI’d say a solid chunk of people get placed,however placed with like a t1 job I don’t think many.I can’t really give you a percentage since we aren’t privy to the exact numbers.There’s a lot of internship opportunities that come by as well and you might get in there as well which might convert based on performance.\n\nI meant it in a “fuck it there’s no point thinking about it” way,if you’re worrying now odds are you’ll take your prep seriously and get placed."
