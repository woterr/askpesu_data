  "title": "[Question] Who do I submit the union bank account form to?",
  "content": "Hey there, recently received the CNR scholarship but hadn't opened a union bank account last sem. Went to the PESIT branch, where they gave me a form to fill and told me to submit the form to open the bank account at the mrd block. At the mrd block reception they told me to go to gjbc accounts, but then the accounts people told me to go back to mrd block where I was now told that they aren't collecting the form to open the bank account. Super confused abt the situation, would really appreciate it if any of yall knew who I could possibly contact for help, or where I could go to submit the form and open the bank account. Thanks.",

    "Yeah seems rather frustrating,the bank and the college are usually never on the same page.\n\nYou can just open a union bank account anywhere,there’s another branch on the road behind the PESIT branch if this one seems to prove troublesome.Once you open an account,give your account details (number,IFSC code,branch name etc) to the COE,which is at the basement of BE block.\n└── Ight thanks man appreciate the help",
