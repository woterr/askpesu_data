Everyone on this sub has been helping as much as they can. You need to realise that people are busy - either with their exams or their internships, or actual full-time work. It does not help that people post the same x vs y college every 2 days without even bothering to search for an existing answer.\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Well I did say do your own research with the s resources available at the sub ðŸ™‚ please read I know u are a graduate and I respect u for that but the guys commenting right k now are all giving false answers if u see their account they are just eyeing for yhe seat maybbe now u will say that I just want hear the answer that\"pes is better â€œ\nâ””â”€â”€ mods ka reply kaha aaya\n    â””â”€â”€ Go through the faqs and pros cons of pesu pinned by the mods *mr owl* those should be enough for the decision placement sheet is also available a.. on reddit"
