    "They reimburse the conference fees for one author, travel fees are not reimbursed. If you have the option to present virtually, you're expected to take it.\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ If you want an S grade, conferences should be 10th edition and above or published in a journal.\n\nIf you want an A grade, I believe you need to have published in a 5th to 10th edition conference. \n\nB is 1st to 5th. \n\nC is if you don't publish. Its the lowest grade you can get.\n    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ So even if you don't come with something working at the end of 4th year, you would still end up completing the credits and getting the degree?",
    "College pay for the publication fees and if it is an international conference college gives you some part of travel expenses as well to attend that conference but not for domestic , if you want a S and A grade you are supposed to publish in an ieee conference and which has good scopus index \n\nThis was how it worked when I was in final year don‚Äôt know if anything has been changed"
