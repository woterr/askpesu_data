  "content": "Last week, I lost my ID card on campus. I tried searching for it but couldn't find it. I asked the receptionist, and they told me they hadn't received any lost ID cards. They suggested I check with the administrator's office in Room 016, but it is always closed whenever I go there. I also asked the accounting department about the procedure to apply for a new ID, but they did not respond clearly. Can someone please help me with this?",
