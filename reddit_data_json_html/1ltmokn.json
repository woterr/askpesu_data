  "content": "Hi everyone,  \nI’ve been scheduled for script review between 4th and 9th July, and the notice mentions that it has to be done on campus.\n\nHowever, I’m not from Bangalore, and traveling all the way just for the review is a bit difficult for me. I wanted to check if there’s any alternative way to review it online or get it via email.\n\nHas anyone contacted the faculty about this or been allowed any other option in similar situations? Any help or suggestions would be really appreciated. ",
