    "Why take hostel if you don't like others coming into your spaceðŸ˜­ I feel like it's a given\nâ””â”€â”€ I'm from Delhi dude\nDon't have any other place to stay\nPlus parents are the ones who put me in it\nAnd they specifically requested a single room, but they were like \"not available for first years\"\n    â”œâ”€â”€ Room no\n    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ U from hostel too?\n    â”œâ”€â”€ Ah.. Well that sucks but you just need to learn to adjust/get used to it :')\n    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ðŸ˜”\n    â””â”€â”€ ayo which hostel and which room, from Delhi NCR too\n        â””â”€â”€ Unit 1 \nU?\n            â””â”€â”€ u in rr campus?\n                â””â”€â”€ Yeah\n                    â””â”€â”€ Which is unit 1?\n                        â””â”€â”€ Wait, u a girl or boy?",
    "U will adapt eventually nobody started loving hostel life in the 1st month itself\nâ””â”€â”€ I like hostel life, my roomie, not so much\n    â””â”€â”€ Then if u have some good friends u can stay in their room apart from sleeping anol . U could also try and request for room change with any of ur friends who wants to be ur roommate too. Tell ur roommate if u don't like something abt him , trust me it becomes easier if u tell the other person, during my 1st year I didn't like my roomie at all in the 1st month but we became good friends eventually",

    "stop being an introvert, problem solved\nâ””â”€â”€ ðŸ™‚ Wah *slow claps* such an amazing solution! Why didn't I think of that?\n    â””â”€â”€ from the way you type, I can tell ur an introvert, it genuinely ain't hard to stop being one, im def getting downvoted for this\n        â”œâ”€â”€ Okay grandma\n        â””â”€â”€ it doesnt work like that , are you retarded?  \nSearch up the definition of introvert , that's not something you can change and \"stop\" being one , you know you're wrong and yet you type it out without even thinking once. \"im def getting downvotedðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ª\"\n            â””â”€â”€ its my opinion man\n                â””â”€â”€ being an introvert is related to psychology it can't be your \"opinion\" , it's science based"
