    "Yeah, yeah, 2 weeks are left for ISA and 4 weeks for ESA and u want to study DSA now \n\nBEST OF LUCK\n└── Bro what\nIf ur talking abt first sem then we got isa 2 from 6th Jan. And esa from 16th.",
    "Bro please study for isa and esa, your first year cgpa is important. And you need C for DSA, how do you plan on doing it when you havent even started 2nd sem where they teach the basics. You'll have plenty of time to worry about dsa during your summer break.\n└── I like your username\n    └── Thanks. I created my 50th reddit account while was stuffing my face with momos in some random restaurant on a lonely night.\n        └── Understandable",
    "why would you want to waste time on a topic which you'll learn next year? If you're free then just learn something out of the syllabus maybe?",
