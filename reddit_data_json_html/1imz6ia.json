I have tried to make new friends but everybody are in their own groups that they prefer. Is this how my college life is gonna end. It's affecting me a bit too much lately that i don't even have proper friends in college. Is it just me who's going through this?\n\n\nEdit: we made a loneliness cult guys, dm if u wanna join🤧",

    "Are you me?",
    "I feel you, all these years I also had to go through times where I would be a bit lonely. It would be nice if we all sharing the same feelings of loneliness could meet at college one day, maybe it might be kinda awkward, but I think it's worth giving a shot.\n└── yeah shd make a \"we all feel lonely\" gc\n    └── If you're serious about doing so, add me too",
    "Buddy, I had loads of friends during college time, had a good but not great and now after college time, every one of them has gone different ways and paths, during college time, I was thinking ki maybe he or she would be there for me in hard time but no one was their seriously no one, at the end of the day, sabko bas apni fikar rehti hai I am alone, jese hi placement mili, gyab hogye and even placement se phle bhi no one was telling anything to each other because I thought dosti mein sab kuch btate hai be it worse or acha, so Dost bnao ya an bnao kya hi farak pdta hai :)\n└── this is so true",
    "i also used to feel the same way the first 2 months...i switched many friend groups and tried to find people who i vibe with....the first 6-7 weeks i felt exactly how u did...but dont overthink about this...give it some time and slowly and surely u will start to find people who want to have a genuine frndship with you....just dont put yourself in a shell and disconnect yourself from others...just keep talking to people and slowly u will find gud frnds...dont overthink about stuff and go for it thats what matters the most\n└── Glad you found your crowd",

    "It's quite common to feel in this way even I had nobody when I joined the college. I was introvert when I joined pesu which was also a major reason for not getting the girl whom i loved the most.  I didn't express to  her and it ended abruptly without any clarity. After this phase I literally joined few clubs like music club, rotaract,aikya etc where I met many people and got some friends I became extremely extrovert.  But in end of the day everybody got job in different fields or companies and few of them decided to pursue higher education but still I made lot of memories especially in Sutta Gully which I will cherish in my life. Also I am grateful for whatever happened in my life. I would like to suggest you to join some clubs in college try to participate in more events try to meet new people start conversation with them. Make memories and Enjoy your life...👍",
    "Bro I’ll be dead ass, it’s just like that in Pesu, and a lot more feel like this. I’ve never had this much trouble finding a group in any other institution . A lot of people are just distant here, you can either wait it out and eventually find a few people you fw like I did or give up. I tried to force conversations a few times but it’s really not worth it.",
    "It doesn't matter if you do or not.  I was lucky to find one person who became my friend. Don't force yourself to be a part of a group if you're not being valued.",
    "Nah buddy, we are there",
    "Woe is the hour\nI miss a love I've never had\nA perpetual downpour\nTo be in this group id be glad",
    "you're not alone 🫂",
    "me in pes. tbh i might have been this way throught out my life and it was somehow okay at the end. The others truly accepted me. but in uni nobody seems to give more than one shit. just get rolled over",
    "im also lon ely pls friends im in ec campus",
    "Its better to be alone than be with people who don't understand you.",
    "omg this is so real. did y'll end up making that group?"
