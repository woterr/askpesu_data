    "I think it's better to arrange your original 10th class marksheet to avoid any further consequences, but if you can't then you can try the copy of digilocker one\n\nAnd Yes u need 2 copies of everything\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Ohh thanks a lot\nâ””â”€â”€ 2 copies of migration certificate,  class 12th marksheet,  class 10 marksheet , adhaar and pan card ???\n    â””â”€â”€ Yeah, 2 copies of every document would be a safe bet. It doesn't take anything.\nBut u can make copies of documents in banglore as well man, any shop ðŸ¤·"
