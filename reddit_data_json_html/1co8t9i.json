My friends who wrote it told me the reality of the exam a couple of days ago and now I know I stand no chance.\nI've studied 12th chem phy and a bit of maths  and in 11th I did chem and phy but only a few imp chapters. I'll probably get around 65 marks.\nTmmrw I'm just going to go and start blind guessing bullshit. I'll add this exam to my list of exams I flunked. Let's see what happens next. Thanks for all the doubts this subreddit answer.",

    "Out of Personal experience, let me tell you... I thought I fked up my Pessat too and I had zero hopes. \nBut when the ranks were released I was actually surprised. \nAnd let me reassure you, I'm an average student and when I say fuxked up I fuxked up.\n└── There were no negative marking back then. We can safely assume 10-15 of your guesses must’ve been correct. We can’t even guess shit and there’s always the probability that our answers are wrong\n    └── bro relax now! tomorrow is comedk dont take stress till tomorrow\n        └── Didn't study anything for comedk too",
    "how was ur exam bro u were too tensed\n└── The exam is fucking jee mains level\nWhy tf is a  private college entrance test this tuff?\nHalf the questions are from deleted chapters and sometimes it's printed wrong too \nAtleast I should have been able to copy from sum1 but the guy sitting in front of me just randomly ticked and left on the spot at 2 hrs and 30 mins\n    └── which shift\n        └── Today's 2nd\n            └── Usss bro it was so tough hopefully there’s normalization\n                └── Hopefully it's easy"
