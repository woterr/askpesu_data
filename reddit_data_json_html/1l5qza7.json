    "Roughly 30 seats are allocated for lateral entry people. The cutoff for CSE ends at 1100 rank(roughly).\nYou have to clear the M1 and M2(0 credit course for which you only write ESA). Other than that you have to clear EVS and Constitution (1 credit each).\n\nYou'll have extra C , python classes for one week and M1 and M2 classes throughout the year. \n\nHope this helps, you can DM if you want further info\n└── Hey what's the fees structure for dcet students like in  kea+university including both and also nearest staying options(like in budget)\n    └── It's 1,30,000 Kea+uni fees.\nYou'll find a lot of pgs near rrc and ecc"
