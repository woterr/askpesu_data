How do they keep track of how many people got placed , does it correctly count the number of people who got placed given people can hold 1 offer in each tier?",

    "It’s pretty accurate. The people maintaining it are well connected and many times the offer email even comes to the whole batch. They do also try to check people who rejected offer etc. or got offered higher tier. Actually the numbers are slightly higher than in the sheet I’d say."
