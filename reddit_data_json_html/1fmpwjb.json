    "The other mods can look into your request. I don't really have the permissions to do so. Regardless, having a combination of (year x branch x campus) will lead to too many combinations, we will need to simplify it.\n└── For 1st year rr campus cse we can use like\n\n1RRCSE (YEAR * CAMPUS * BRANCH)\n    └── lmfao you realize ur method doesnt change the number of combinations right\n        └── Bruh, I don't care with the num of combos xd, just tell the mods to give an editable flair, we can set our flair in this way or smtg\n            └── but I feel it's pointless it's obvious that a cse related query is going to be answered by a cse senior"
