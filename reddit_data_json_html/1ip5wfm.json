  "content": "Another day, another reminder that I’m painfully single. People keep saying “just wait, the right guy will come along” but at this point, I think he took one look at me and filed for a restraining order.\n\nIt’s always the same thing. Some initial interest, a few good conversations, and then suddenly they realize I’m not into casual flings or half-hearted situationships. And just like that, they vanish, no explanation, no drama, just a peaceful exit like they were never here. Maybe I’m too reserved, maybe I expect too much, or maybe I was simply built for character development and not romance.\n\nMeanwhile, everyone around me is getting into relationships like it’s the easiest thing in the world, and I’m just here waiting and dying alone.",
