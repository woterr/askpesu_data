    "You should have met him before the final isa marks display. Now he won't update it, as it's already the result's day.\n├── yea. and its kinda OP's fault for not following instructions\n│   └── Yeah. Tough luck, but these instructions are always made clear before ISA week. Now it's too late. Just take the L and move on.\n└── I have met him but he dint update\n    ├── You have to meet him again and again until he updates, otherwise he will definitely forget it.\n    └── Like I have met him before the results only he told he will update even after results I told him he told he will still update ",
    "Since the results haven't dropped yet take a chance and go and meet him today"
