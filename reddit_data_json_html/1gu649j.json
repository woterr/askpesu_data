    "Getting an 8+ requires you to at the very least, get an 8.0 grade point in every course, which translates to a B grade in every course. B grade in every course means getting a 70+/100 in every course in your overall score of ISA+ESA+assignment. It's hard to predict using a single ISA score.\n\nGetting an 8+ isn't that difficult since you can effectively lose 30 marks out of 100 and still get it. Similarly, getting a 9 GPA means getting 80+ in every course. You can play around with the score for each ISA/ESA and figure out how much you need to score, given that these will be scaled. \n\nNext time, read the FAQs. The GPA question has this explained in detail and even has a GPA calculator to automate things like this.",
    "Homie remember the golden rule, if everyone fucked the exam, no one did. \nAlso it’s fine man. I’ve graduated this year and I can’t remember a single thing I studied for these stupid exams because they don’t translate into what you’ll do eventually either ways. Just be consistent and do your best and you’ll be sorted.",
    "Yes you do get SGPA 8-8.5 if you grind hard in every subject.\n\nBut Bruh let me be honest , CGPA doesn’t even matter except the thing is to be eligible for placements.\n\nIk the whole point is abt the placements but yea it doesn’t mean if u have higher GPA you will get a best job, other words if u have a less GPA doesn’t mean you will end up with a mediocre job.\n\n\nIt all depends on various factors like your skills and most importantly LUCK 🍀 factor should help you.\n\nYou will understand better once the placements starts for you!\n\nATB:)\n└── what about higher studies GPA is very important imo...\n    └── Yea :)",
    "even i am cooked , dw lets hope chem/phy is better.",

    "I got 16 in isa 1 and still got B grade in math.(With an sgpa above 8.5 with S grade in Chem and mech,you can absolutely get above 8 sgpa still). ISA 1 gives you a good idea of how to prepare in the future, all is not lost, just focus on what’s in front of you for now, trust me you’ll be just fine, all the best for your remaining isa\n└── so wts your current CGPA??\n    └── 8.66",
    "If its that bad you may need to write it again as backlog. Study properly and don't make the same mistake.\n└── So if we get very less marks in isa1 will I have to retake the test or what?\n    └── u have 2 do real well in subsequent isas n esa to make up. if you screw isa 2theres no way to get high gpa even if u study.\n        └── Real well in the sense wt range of score do I need to score?! Is it 30+ or 35+?",
    "Man even I need an answer to this..but what happens if scoring 30+ in other subjects is not possible in this isa..won't we get 8.5gpa atleast?!?",
    "Chill, u can make up for it ",
    "These juniors really need to chill out ,after just their first paper they're stressed out they got whole semesters ahead\n└── We all were there at some point, just that they're unloading it on this platform ://\n    └── I agree with you but this whole subreddit's now filled with rants and cries for help all the time ,idk how I feel about these new batches anymore\n        └── Lame shitposts and repetitive questions are annoying I agree, but I don't see any harm in ranting about exams. Exams in this college are not very easy and I can understand why newcomers may feel overwhelmed. Maybe because this is an anonymous platform they felt they could freely talk about it here?\n            ├── Definitely, the reason why mods go easy on them. Unlike r/bangalore ughh.\n            └── Sure but they could sit and study instead too\n                └── Ok dude. I doubt spending 2 minutes on a three line reddit post would massively disrupt someone's study schedule. If you're so bothered by a post, why not downvote and move on?"
