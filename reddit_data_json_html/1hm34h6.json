    "From my experience, the 8th sem Special Topic is extremely peaceful. I took “Introduction to Software Testing” (not sure if it’s still there). Literally just going through the slides 1 day before the exam type subject. If it’s still online on the weekends like ours was, even more peaceful. Just login and sleep. \n\nSo I wouldn’t worry about it even if it’s mandatory now.",
    "No, only those who can't get a paid internship needs too.",
    "For 26' passouts  it's gonna be different right ?",
    "Only if you do not have enough credits to graduate (160) after accounting for all internship credits and credits through other means.\n├── I thought so too but here it says we need 2 credits from special topic\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/383c228hv09e1.png?width=671&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7944c983bfec4721d69617f4f3f2e576ab207263\n│   └── yes, looks like it mandatory now, but do not worry, it will be online and only on weekends, afaik\n│       └── What bout the people who got placed in other cities? It makes no sense to come back for a 60 minute isa no?? Is there an alternative\n│           └── okay, in those cases, I am not sure what they will do\n└── https://preview.redd.it/uls9z6p1x09e1.png?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2702621991275d1eb660a1643ff9aed9be2cf0c\n\nI think they've changed it. Looking at point 4, it seems like there's compulsory 2 credits special topic in 8th sem. Not sure"
