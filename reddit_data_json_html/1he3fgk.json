FYI, google \"PESU CSE notes GitHub\" and you'll find a repository their notes that helped everyone in the 2022 batch pass ESAs. \n\nu/abaksy look how they've massacred you :(\n│           └── Oh I'm really sorry\n\nI didn't realise it's Aronya Anna🙏🏼\n│               └── Issok lmao, I wanted only because I worked with Go for 2 years and I have an interest in distributed systems (Go is also one of my favourite languages 🙂)\n│                   └── Oh I see, [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10T5HzErzKGrIlI7FW4qCpsaNbou-5HMD/edit?usp=drivesdk&amp;ouid=115092938925708009314&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true) was the syllabus for our batch\n├── Thanks\n└── A bit of extra info: CIE L1 and L2 were actually considered as special topics you could opt for. So you still have 2 credits of special topic, it's just that your choice is already decided lmao"
