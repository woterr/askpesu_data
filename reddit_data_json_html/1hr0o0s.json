  "content": "I really don't know what's wrong with all the people who are shitting on Rowlet on the other post. He merely said that whatever went down yesterday was wrong. I don't see what's wrong in that. Sure, you're at that age where doing things like this seen fun, but also have the balls to accept what you did was wrong after all the fun y'all had from throwing a bed.\n\nTo all the people who are saying things like \"it ain't that deep\", know that you guys are promoting and defending public vandalism. This is exactly what the vandals who break damage buses and cars during strikes say.\n\nY'all asking Rowlet to grow up, blud y'all the ones who've to grow up. What do you even mean by \"this was common in my parents time, I don't see what's wrong\". Oh you don't wanna get me started on what else was common in your parents' time :D\n\nIf you guys feel so right about it, then maybe you should have done it at your home, with your own bed. Hypocrites \n\nThe next post is gonna be about how the hostel &amp; PES rules are strict as fuck lmfao. No shit sherlock. Y'all are the exact reason why we can never have fun things",

    "Some comments even brought racism into it like bruh, calling you out is not racism?",
    "Rowlett though had a valid point, maybe his usage of words might’ve offended others. I don’t think what he’s said is wrong. Bringing racism and all that nonsense against him doesn’t make sense at all. He just tried to make a point that taking joy from vandalism isn’t the right thing. \n\nYes, I do agree being a fresher that he shouldn’t have called the entire batch that… but *just cuz he called us that doesn’t make us without a head, does it?*",
    "The amount of people defending vandalism is insane. Next time, they will start breaking glasses in the name of 'fun'.",
    "See vandalism is wrong, but rowlet blamed the whole generation for something a few kids did.   \nFirstly: rowlet himself is only 5-6yrs elder then us freshers, idk why he acts like he is 30yrs elder then us.   \nSecondly: Why does he act like his \"generation\" did not to do all this. Boys hostels have been doing messed up things since generations, at least ragging is a lot less in the newer batches.   \nI think its not just this generation but most of us Indians have zero respect for property that does not belong to us, u can see it in all age groups.   \nBut yes rowlet's points stand.\n├── Ragging was nil afaik till '25 batch . how's it now\n│   └── its nil now too.\n└── \nLike you’ve concluded your comment, he didn’t say anything wrong. The way of conveying might’ve been wrong \n\nThough Rowlett might be 5-6 years older than us, he is 30 years wiser than us\n    └── brother i am on supporting rowlet too.   \nand my point is the same, the way rowlet conveyed it is kinda wrong.",
    "wasnt his intention in my opinion, and all of us dont have to keep dragging on stuff till it applies to a narrative we want. Tbh I agreed a lot when he said its \"tough love\" to us juniors.   \nend this on mutual respect",
    "agreed!! \nimmature and stupid behavior",
    "Y'all are more offended that he said \"this generation\" more than the vandalism and degenerate behaviour itself lmfao grow up children.",
    "rowlett aint letting u hit lil bro\n├── Didn't let me hit and I've been friends with him for almost 6 years 😔\n└── lies",
    "Yeah hes absolutely correct but his wording is absolute garbage. Instead of saying the people who did the actual vandalism is fucked in the head he called the whole batch fucked in the head. Then he goes on to say that when he says you \"all\" are retards he dosent mean the whole batch. Its hard to agree with someone who antagonizes you woudnt you agree?",
    "Someone please tell me, what happened?",
    "What vandalism happened?",
    "CONTROVERSY 🔥🔥 HELL YEAH",
    "Idk about the incident but I have stopped reasoning with juniors. People seem to get worser every year",
    "Every year a new bunch of wankers come in to commit such foolery. Then there are other bunch of wankers, supporting it in the name of \"being cool\". Sure you are. Rowlet-owl got out of this shit hole long ago, so am I this year 🙏🏼🙏🏼👍🏼👍🏼.\n└── “You’ll miss your college days” it’s awesome being able toto breathe while going to have breakfast in my office as opposed toto being crammed like sardines in front of BE block"
