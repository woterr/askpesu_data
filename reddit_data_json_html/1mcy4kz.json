    "isn't this bad-?\n└── None of them were great\n    ├── some were good from the list like laavisha , saranya and arvind.  \nalso most of them left because of management pressure i think.  \nMany of these profs were asked to teach subjects not in their domain and also  were assigned AI/ML related subjects\n    │   └── Bruh lakshmeesha of all people teaches ml, bro just used to skip slides of tough topics, he is a good guy but not for ml\n    │       └── he taught ipcv well , afaik he revived that elective although only 20 odd ppl ppl chose the elective.  \nbut i also agree many of them did not like him teaching subjects like DA and ML\n    ├── A lot of them were incredibly senior teachers(Bharathi, Alpha and Annapurna) who were integral members of the CSE Department. The S&amp;H Department teachers were also very good(Udoshi, Sachna, Lavisha), I remember Sachna ma'am especially because she did such a good job of teaching a subject almost everyone was afraid of. \n\nArvind was also very knowledgeable. Unfortunately, he had a pretty long background in industry and I don't think teaching a bunch of unruly students was something he enjoyed. \n\nDon't know/haven't heard good things about the others(Saranya, Swati Shah, Rohith Vaidya(he was very kind and approachable though))\n    ├── Udhosi was good\n    └── Wasn't udoshi the goat 🐐\n        ├── he was , but he had some weird attitude.   \nalways kept reminding us every week about how he never took 1 day leave in his career.\n        └── i heard he was somehow involved during the suicide of the kid last year",
