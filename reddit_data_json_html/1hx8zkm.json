  "title": "Canteen guys served us chicken instead of paneer ",
  "content": "\n\n4th floor, EC campus, btw.\n\nWe went early to order food and stood there for 20 minutes despite there being barely a crowd. Finally, the guy showed up with two plates, yelled our token number, said one was paneer and the other gobi, and gave me the paneer. By now, it was already hella crowded, so I just took the plate quickly and made my way out of the crowd. It was completely covered in gravy and didnt look different from the paneer we usually order, so we just assumed that's what it was.\n\nFriend and I took a bite and instantly spat it out; didnt seem like paneer, we suspected it was meat. She and I are vegetarians, so obviously, we were quite startled. One of our other friends who eats meat tried it and confirmed it indeed was. We went back to the guy and informed him. He was quite rude about it until I fought with him and showed him the payment on my phone. Only THEN did he apologize and give us the paneer, and then brushed it off as if nothing happened.\n\nI understand there's a huge crowd during breaks, so there must have been some sort of miscommunication. But please be careful while ordering in this canteen (or just any other canteen considering the shitty hygiene). Unlike me and many others, if you have the privilege of enjoying home cooked meals, minimize or completely avoid eating at the canteen.\n\n\n",

I feel no remorse, ngl I'd roast that shit nice and ARGHHðŸ‘¹ðŸ‘¹ that shit up. Ykwim?",
    "Don't go there, come to the OG pixel canteen. The cashier and the other staff are very friendly. Sometimes there'll be a crowd, but you can take food and sit near the basketball court. So peaceful man. Idk why ppl go to 4th floor canteen\nâ””â”€â”€ Zor zor se logo ko scheme batade",
    "Wtaf. The kitchen in 4th floor is pretty new but what the fuck. I'd be pissed if that happened to me. Just go to APU fam(it's the canteen next to the basketball court). They give food way faster and veg items there are pretty nice as well",
    "4th floor canteen, my friend got a cockroach in his sandwich.",
    "Also they use the same wok for cooking veg and non veg chinese items.\nâ””â”€â”€ I am aware, and to be honest, it's a fucking college canteen, so I can't expect them to take the hassle of separate vessels and shit. But I didn't expect them to actually serve us chicken\n    â””â”€â”€ That's why I would suggest getting home cooked food, if you're a day scholar.",
    "At least you are getting a dead cockroach",
    "Wow, thanks for this.",
    "Lucky u are",
    "If it's an honest mistake there isn't much you can do .",
    "Why doesn't this happen to non vegetarians?\nâ””â”€â”€ I dont fucking know man, maybe it does happen. This post is about exposing the canteen for the negligent shithole it is, not debating veg vs non-veg. Take this bullshit elsewhere."
