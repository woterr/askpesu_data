  "content": "Okay so this was actually kind of weird.\n\nI'm just standing there at the end of the Baskin robbins stall, minding my business, when this older girl — like, clearly a senior — comes up and starts talking to me out of nowhere. At first I thought she maybe needed directions or lost her friends or something. Nope. She was trying to chat. Like, actually chat.\n\nShe starts asking me what year I'm in, and immediately I’m like… red flag? Why does that even matter? I tell her I’m a first year, thinking that would kind of end the convo, and she just got all awkward and dipped.\n\nWhich… honestly, thank you?\n\nSuper weird energy overall. Felt like I was getting interviewed for something I did not sign up for. 10/10 would not recommend. Not sticking for longer time from next event onwards.",
