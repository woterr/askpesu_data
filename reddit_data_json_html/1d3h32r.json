  "content": "Ignore this post, the room got taken by some other tenant  \n  \nI used to be a 3rd year in the boys hostel at PES, but now I'm moving out. I found a really nice 2BHK near PES here [https://maps.app.goo.gl/2mFnKBPSRpLq8eNz8](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2mFnKBPSRpLq8eNz8) .  \nThe owner said that the total rent would be 9.5k per month which seems like a really sweet deal, and with a roommate it would be 4.75k for each person. The house seems to have capacity for 4 people, 2 per bedroom, but one roommate is quite cost effective already. This sounded too good to be true and I wondered why people hadn't snatched it yet, but the owner, who lives below, drove it hard into my head that this was a peaceful residential area so they wanted no drinking, smoking, or noise.  \nDo let me know through comments or dms if you are interested or want any extra information. Please reply fast because I'm worried about this house getting taken by another customer so I'll have to lock this house in a day myself.  \n(Pics can be seen if you click on the post)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/noeqa1f7ce3d1.jpg?width=1040&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d6d44829c759baaf29fe1d7cad88d8f99ca254f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m4dmsr78ce3d1.jpg?width=1040&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f1dd0b5d6fdff638b065328cad3b629dd149f42\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9s2x7zf9ce3d1.jpg?width=1040&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae58a483482125c1c93e1dddb39473113d8c3577\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/idggdif9ce3d1.jpg?width=1040&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4ed39f4982e1bcb88db0abe1fb2ae0cc536e628\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7y1vfjf9ce3d1.jpg?width=1040&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5463ace2fb5cbf04392632efa2591c02010c50bd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wh0u3ff9ce3d1.jpg?width=1040&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9668cf313616bcd8c247ae954d92ffcb81cc1d54\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xj7smef9ce3d1.jpg?width=1040&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9cde3adea7b00df68e52ba8a6d0cb5641829efe2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d2lnwef9ce3d1.jpg?width=1040&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=521a35f4a640b0e39bb7f15881127abbfaa6c13c",

    "How on earth are u getting that for 9.5k?!?\n└── I'm surprised myself, I wondered if there was some particular problem with the house, but it just appears that the owner is selective or something, and he hasn't advertised this anywhere except on a poster",
    "Place looks terrible.\n└── Most of this is the owner's stuff, and he'll move it out if you want. Painting hasn't been done, but if you want the painting you'll lose some money from your deposit"
