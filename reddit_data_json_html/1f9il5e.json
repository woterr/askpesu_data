    "many of the staff at ecc have good contacts with higher education from foreign and indian unis for mtech\nand they will help you out if you approach them if you wanna write gate\n└── Just ecc? Or rr as well? What abt for cse ?",
    "Ok thanks, do you have any idea like how many students prep for gate and go for mtech in iits/iisc each year",
    "Placements were not good this year because the market is down all over the world. It should mostly be stabilized by the time you ppl graduate.  Everyone writes GATE and stuff but most people just write GRE and go abroad for their MTech. I'm also from ECE EC and one of my friends got into IITM through GATE and 2 or 3 others got into NIT in my batch I think. There's around 120 people in my batch. You can do the math",
    "Oh I see\nThanks"
