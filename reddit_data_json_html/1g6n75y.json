    "Depends on the department, topic and panel. Assuming your topic is very new and isn’t backed with enough published results (or you haven’t kept your guide in the loop)……and your panel has some hidden agenda against you, I would assume they will torture you till ESA project review and tell you to start all over again from the next semester.\n└── In that case what grade does one end up with\n    └── C or D mostly. I don’t know anyone who has failed.",
    "They'll listen to you. I mean they have to right. But if its really bad...pay attention to feedback and improve. It really depends on your guide and how strict they are.\n└── It went well. Thanks",
    "Yes they can reject and then ask you to talk to your mentor for better idea"
