Some of you are pretty great kids, I've spoken to quite a few both here, on discord, as well as WhatsApp. But there will always be bad apples. And if you don't call out the bad apples, you're as much part of the problem as the problem poses. \n\nI have nothing against the parents who worked hard to send their kids here. But trust me, vandalising property tarnishes their efforts more than it annoys me.\n│                       ├── PESU 4+ senior here, I just wanted to share my perspective. \n\nWhile your point was technically valid, the way it was phrased could have been better. Using terms like “entire generation is fucked up” comes across as generalizing and unfairly blaming everyone for the actions of a few. Words like “entire” weren’t necessary in this context. There’s no denying that their actions were wrong, but perhaps choosing more precise words next time would convey your message more effectively. Just a thought :)\n│                       └── Yeah these students are ridiculous, and the fools got caught on camera too, what do they think will happen next.\n├── U r a reddit mod 🤣\n│   ├── I pity you if you think that's all I am\n│   │   └── So you're also a discord mod??\n│   │       └── Some of y'all act like you don't know who I am.\n│   │           ├── Ily and everything youve done for this subreddit man I was joking 🥲\n\nThis is absolutely typical boys hostel shit, I agree some juniors are lame af but pretty sure people living in hostels were doing stuff like this decades ago. This is actually tame. My dad tells me how is roommates set his bed on fire 30 yrs ago.\n│   │           │   └── I'm not stopping everyone from having fun in the hostel. It's after all the best years of your life. \n\nBut there's a thin line between going crazy and being a nuisance. Destroying property, vandalising, causing damage, especially to things *you* are paying for is stupid. Plus from whatever I've heard of the warden, they're definitely going to get to you for something like this, given the fact that they have a video of it too.\n\nY'all just keep giving the PESU management to be more of a dick to you all and then proceed to complain that they aren't nice to you.\n│   │           │       ├── I don't even stay in the boys hostel 😭\n│   │           │       └── Ok dude u r the ideal person who ever exists. american decency u have. u hate how most of indians act ok ok u dont have to show ur racism here.\n│   │           │           ├── Racism? Hate for Indians? Wtf? \n\nI'm grateful that my parents raised me well enough to know the difference between having fun and destroying private property. I'm sorry your parents could not do the same. \n\nAnd if vandalising is what you define as \"Indian decency\" and \"how most Indians act\", then the disdain I show towards you all is justified. I don't hate India or Indians, this country will always be my home. But I definitely hate the way you all normalise acts like these.\n│   │           │           │   └── Womp womp going at parents the best u can do anyways seeing how edgy u are\n│   │           │           ├── How does racism even come into picture here?

But fun has its limits no? What if I broke into your house and broke your TV in the name of fun?\n\nThe other issue is that people literally give the management a list of reasons to hate them and then complain on discord/reddit/my DMs that the management is being hard on them. Hypocritical much? \n\nSure, go out and have fun for new year's. But don't be a dick to others.\n│       └── What will calling them out do? Will they suddenly become good boys and never do this again? This is an exaggeration but it's like calling out terrorists for killing innocent people.\n Your words fall on deaf ears, tbh I don't think there even are ears your words can reach. Also no one is defending this, just laughing at it, best thing to do is laugh,  just say it's wrong and ignore, not call our entire batch mentally challenged\n│           └── &gt; just say it's wrong\n\nAnd tell me, how many comments before mine actually did this?\n│               └── Oh ur such a good boy pointing out it's wrong. Want a candy? You didn't even say it's bad u just said  \"Looks like  this entire generation is a little fucked in their head\" Uve only started saying vandalising property is bad AFTER uve gotten called out. Your original comment just called every fresher \"fucked in the head\" which is pretty ambiguous wouldn't you say?\n│                   └── &gt;Oh ur such a good boy pointing out it's wrong. Want a candy?\n\nYour sarcasm only speaks about your character. Just goes to show that irrespective of how much you say in your comments that \"it was wrong\", you clearly enjoyed the vandalism and approved of it. If you all really think that doing so was okay, there is something inherently wrong. If you really thought what they did was incorrect, why didn't you speak up? Or do you really think that breaking others' property is okay? \n\n&gt;Your original comment just called every fresher \"fucked in the head\" which is pretty ambiguous wouldn't you say?\n\nPeople breaking property, everyone here celebrating it and nobody here pointing out the wrongfulness of the act. Tell me now, this along with the countless other examples over the past half-year, do you all really think that your seniors would think highly of your batch? Sure, the disdain might be a bit exaggerated but I do not think it is misplaced. We do not hate all of you, but the things a few of you do make us dislike most of you.\n│                       └── Yes I enjoyed it, why should I speak out about something I cannot change. People have offed themselves on campus and reddit posts about it do ABSOLUTELY nothing. It seems my being sarcastic about your holier than thou act talks about my bad character. Uve been in pes for 4 years and u think one tiny comment on a reddit post will make some clowns change their behaviour? Stop being so delusional 😂\nCountless other examples? Oh please name 10 examples  of this vandalism level things that freshers have done. \"We do not hate all of you, but the things a few of you do make us dislike most of you.\" Ok I hate all humans because a few of them do horrific acts. Please speak with logic\n│                           └── &gt;Yes I enjoyed it\n\nSorry, I am not engaging in any more conversation after this exchange. I'm always up for constructive discussions but not when the other person derives pleasure out of something like vandalism. Maybe once you start working and actually start paying for things you buy, you will find it less funny to throw those things out of a balcony. Its easy to find humour in things when you aren't responsible.\n\n&gt;u think one tiny comment on a reddit post will make some clowns change their behaviour?\n\nThem changing their ways is up to them, not me - I am not responsible for the people they choose to be. Calling people out for doing the wrong thing is what I was raised and taught to do, and I've done so. I've done my bit. Whether they choose to be better humans is their call.\n\n&gt;Oh please name 10 examples of this vandalism level things that freshers have done\n\nI am not referring to vandalism when I refer to past events. I am referring to *all* the inappropriate posts, comments and exchanges that have taken place across various platforms. You would be surprised to see the number of NSFW posts/messages that the moderators both here and on discord have deleted. Yet, we still entertain questions and doubts from you all and I try to answer as many questions as my time allows me to. But as I said in a different comment: you guys keep giving us reasons to judge you all.\n\nAnyway, as I said, I do not wish to argue with someone who would allow such acts to happen. Hope you find more clarity soon and I wish you all the best for your life at PES and career ahead.\n\nHave a good day.\n│                               └── I'm sick of ur goody two shoes act, holier than thou act. Stop acting like ur some saint. I never allowed such acts to happen and never will. The people in the video will get their punishment in due time. Ur making up some image of me in ur mind because I found idiots throwing a bed funny. Ur making up some delusions that I'm deriving pleasure off them throwing it off while I'm laughing at the sheer stupidity of the people in the video. I am 100% clear on what I think while I'm 0% clear on what bs ur cooking up in your head. Have a good life\n├── Same generation as you!!😑😑\n│   └── Too young to be a millennial, too old to belong to Gen Z :cri:\n├── Lol such things have been happening in hostels since our dad's times. Maybe u haven't experienced hostel Life at all , I understand why u don't find it funny, but it's surely not a new thing happening only in this generation , there used to be ragging and even more insane shit earlier. Imo this isn't even 10% of all that\n│   └── I'm aware that far worse things have happened in hostels and these aren't new. In fact these are very tame compared to what used to happen.\n\nHowever, you cannot say that just because *worse* things used to happen, it is completely okay for *bad* things to happen. You cannot normalise acts of vandalism. What's next? School shootings are happening in the US, must be totally okay to do the same here?\n\nIf something is wrong, it is wrong. Does not matter *how* wrong. And don't forget that these are students who are dependent on their parent's money for hostel. They are damaging things their parents are paying for. Have a little respect for their money, at the very least. Go destroy things your are paying for with your own hard earned money, you will see that you won't be able to go through with it.\n│       └── Completely agree but u can't just blame it on 1 generation that was my point \n│           └── Did not say that. There are bad apples in every generation. What's important is to know what they did was wrong.\n│               └── U just straightaway blamed the entire generation as I can see from ur first comment, as if ur gen people behaved like saints. Anyways no point of arguing more over this. Happy new year\n│                   └── Happy new year to you too, have a blessed 2025!\n├── Bruh, you’re just typing out long paragraphs trying to justify yourself like you’re in some kind of court trial. The thing is, it’s your opinion. If you didn’t like it, you could’ve just said, ‘This is lame’ or ‘This is wrong’ or something like that. But calling the entire batch of freshers ‘fucked in the head’ based on the actions of a few students just shows how presumptuous you are about them. Most people here aren’t enjoying or applauding them for their actions, it’s just funny how stupid they are. They’ll surely get punished by the management. They’re still freshers and don’t have a clear idea of the consequences, and they’ll be the ones to suffer.\n\nWhy do you care so much, acting like some kind of vigilante? Putting out your opinion isn’t wrong, but generalizing this to the entire batch just makes it seem like you think you’re the only mature person who rises against bad behaviour.\n│   └── 1. It's appalling how not a single comment did what you asked, neither before my original comment nor after. Clearly, nobody pointed out how this was wrong. That is why I care. These are kids who obviously do not know what they are doing. As a senior if you or I don't attend the very least try to show them the right path, we wouldn't be good seniors. \n2. Presumptuous? Absolutely. There are many reasons that justify so. Maybe one day (and if possible), I'll show you the cleanup we need to do of all the inappropriate and mindless content posted by this batch in various posts, comments and messages across different platforms. You don't get to see it because we try our best to clean them up before it gets activity. From weird NSFW content to declarations of violence, there is something of everything. So yes, there *is* is a prevailing negative opinion about this batch. As I said in a different comment: the dislike is a little exaggerated but it's definitely not misplaced. We don't hate everyone obviously, but it's hard to like everyone. \n3. Long paragraphs are justified, given that most of these comments went after my character and even called me out as a racist (?). If you think me calling them retards was the last straw, then I should have called it and turned my back on this batch months ago when the freshers started calling me all sorts of things. But I didn't, I continued out of goodwill and I guess that's the price I paid for being nice\n│       └── I’ve seen some of the recent posts, and honestly, some of them are just plain redundant and stupid. Seeing how people replied to your comment—especially throwing around words like ‘racist’—felt completely unnecessary. I can imagine how frustrating it must be for you as a mod to deal with stuff like this. But let’s be real, no matter what you say, they’re just going to gang up on you anyway, so it’s not worth stressing over. You can’t change them—let the management deal with it. I’m pretty sure they’re already aware of what’s going on.\n\nThat said, this subreddit is actually a great place. I’ve resolved quite a few issues here myself, even back when I was a fresher. Keeping it running smoothly is important, and as a mod, you’ve got the power to make that happen. Honestly, I have no idea how you even find the time or patience for this. I can’t imagine managing something like this after I graduate.\n\nAt the end of the day, all you can do is keep maintaining the subreddit and doing your part. You’re not going to change everyone, especially when they’re not willing to listen. \nAnyways Happy New Year, and thanks for everything you’ve done here. A lot of students, including me, have benefited from your efforts.\n│           └── Yep, you're right. \n\nAnd no problem, always happy to help fellow juniors. Happy New Year to you as well!\n└── there there lil Rowley bird, calling the entire batch a lil fucked in the head is a little retarded isn't it? if you genuinely have so much hate towards our batch why do you bother helping us out, can't be outta goodwill if hate on the batch is it just because you're lonely asf or because it's your ego to be the \"pride of pesu\" you just wanna act like our saviour and want us to dickride your puny achievements. why stay in a place full of mentally fucked lads when you could just leave?\n    └── It has always been out of goodwill. The same reason I take time out from my schedule to help you all, or even fit in a visit to PES to meet the people from your batch who want to talk to me. If this isn't respect for your batch, idk what is. \n\nAs I said in an earlier comment: I did not ask for the \"Pride of PESU\" status (which FYI, juniors like you called me). I never consider my advice or suggestions to be the best ones. You're always free to do what's best for you. I just share my experience and insights. They may or may not help you. \n\nMaybe you're right. I should just leave. Since all I asked for in return was mutual respect for the help and support I provide, unfortunately I do not get the same on my DMs and previous comments. If you all don't need my help, I'll just stop helping out here.\n        └── l'm not from this \"batch\", i just find your egoistic and cocky reply very harsh on these freshers\n            └── So much that you created an account today just to post this eh? Lovely.\n\nAnyway, you did not address any of my actual points and are just picking at a factual assumption I made. People like you always love to point fingers and ask questions but have no response when you actually get valid responses.\n\nAnd its a massive shame that this entire post has turned more into picking apart my comments about freshers acting retarded instead of actually calling out the freshers doing something retarded. Not even one comment after me (or before) has questioned why this was done. Speaks a lot about your maturity and priorities.\n                └── since there are people from every batch here, none of them objected to it as well, are you trying to call every batch retarded now? maybe the entire college is retarded and the only sane dignified and mature person here is you.\nyou are just a pretentious brat.\nand as for the freshers throwing the bed off; it aint that deep 😭\n                    └── Definitely the most mature person on this comment thread given that nobody else seems to object to what was done. Don't see how I'm pretentious given that a lot about my life is transparent, I never mince my words and you can always look up the person I am and judge for yourself. I've never pretended to be someone I'm not, my words and opinions are always my own and I always accept it when my facts/suggestions/advice is wrong. \n\nAnd I'm sorry but you cannot possibly justify vandalism and say \"it ain't that deep\". You are simply encouraging worse, if not similar behaviour. You cannot damage property that doesn't belong to you and say \"lols bro\". Howd you find it if someone entered your room and threw your bed out?\n\nAs I said previously, these are students still dependent on their parents' money for hostel amenities. Atleast respect the money your parents are putting in for your education. Once you start earning on your own, I'd love to see how many of you would find it \"not deep\" to throw the stuff you've bought with your earnings out from your balcony. There is nothing funny about breaking private property. \n\nIf you're their senior as you claim to be , maybe try setting a better example by helping them differentiate between right and wrong.\n                        └── i can't believe you find throwing a bed off so serious, you wouldn't have survived college if you were born a decade ago, the things I've heard from my parents and his colleagues;nah America has turned you soft and yes I'm setting an example by helping them realise they can't be bullied into not having fun as kids by some wannabe whitewashed egoistic senior\n                            └── Here, addressed the same point earlier about previous generations: https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/s/xf8H5aXFvo\n\nI'm sorry but I was raised better than to throw things my parents paid for out from the balcony or vandalise something else in the name of fun. I am not sure how you or the others can normalise something as serious as damaging private property.\n\n&gt; you find throwing a bed off so serious\n\nYes, I find it serious because I understood the financial privilege I came from and I'm aware that there are millions in our country who don't have what you and I do. My parents sacrificed a lot to support my dreams, and I'm grateful for everything they've provided. So destroying property has never been \"fun\" for me. The very thought of that would be disrespectful to everything they've done for me. \n\nIf you see nothing wrong in it, you are simply too young and immature to realise the privilege you come from and the value of money. Wait until you start earning and you will then realise how it feels to destroy your own property. Or even worse, when you work your ass off to buy someone something they need and they break it for \"fun\". \n\n&gt; bullied into not having fun\n\nI never said people aren't allowed to have fun. By all means, these are your years to enjoy and we've been in your shoes too. But there's a fine line between having fun and being a nuisance. Breaking property isn't the only way to have fun. \n\nAnd as I said, if you all don't want my help anymore on this sub, happy to oblige. It was all out of goodwill for juniors. If all you guys are gonna do is weird/inappropriate stuff which we seniors have to put up with and yet expect us to help you out, or assassinate my character because you think I shouldn't have called you put on something like this, then sure. You aren't really going to get any support or help from me or most of the other seniors.\n                                └── True🙏🙏",
