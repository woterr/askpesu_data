    "I was expecting 7.5 and easily got 8 lol. It's the new grading scheme, the minimum marks have been reduced to 35 and there is an 11-mark difference. So people who got 75+ easily got A grade which would have harder under the older grading scheme where u got a B.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Is this confirmed? That 35 is passing grade (E) and S is 90 and there is 11 mark diff for every grade i.e., 79 is A, 68 is B, 57 is C and 46 is D?\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ This was what was told to us during the semester orientation so if it's true.Â \nâ””â”€â”€ 11 marks difference?",
    "Pes either does this or no relative at allðŸ’€",
    "Imagine if this is the calm before the storm and a major fuck-you from PES is on its way\nâ””â”€â”€ Hahaha anything is possible at this point",
    "Bro ppl here have a problem if they get good results also, last sem literally people were complaining about bad results, plz pick a side ðŸ™†",
    "Why tf do u care abt others results. Just be happy if u have scored well if u are not obsessed with scholarship . We are just 1 sem away from placements so why don't u just stay happy with the gpa increaseÂ \nâ””â”€â”€ Yep. You just need above 9 and you can sit for all companies placement.\n    â”œâ”€â”€ but that cutoff depends on how many people they want to shortlist right? so if everybody's gpa increases won't the cutoff increase as well?\n    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ But they have ruined our results too earlier , so everything balances out if u consider cgpa and still very few people would have gpa&gt;9\n    â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ okay yeah fair enough\n    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ I don't really think so. It depends on the company tbh. Usually they just send OA to everyone who applied. Some only want the top 100 and so on.\n    â””â”€â”€ bro why 7.5 female cse good DSA is it tough ?\n        â””â”€â”€ If you have good DSA skills then passing OA is peaceful. 7.5 cgpa is pretty hit or miss though. Most tier 1 companies do above 8 or 8.5 . Some do above 7 but it's pretty uncommon nowadays.\n\nCompanies will come to hire only female candidates. You can try them out for better chances although I heard that the OA's are really hard.\n            â””â”€â”€ I quailed for an internship with PPO 31LPA with 6.6 cgpa last sem on campus\n                â””â”€â”€ If you already have a PPO, then you don't have to worry about placements ðŸ˜­\n                    â””â”€â”€ Are you 3rd year ?\n                        â””â”€â”€ Yes, I am (see flair)",
    "What do you guys think about the cnr cutoffs this time is a 8.95 possible",
    "Juking the stats for the placementsÂ ",
    "bell curve tuning about to happen next sem xD.\nâ””â”€â”€ What does this mean, will they mark strictly  next sem?\n    â””â”€â”€ Can't say for sure, but it happened to us in 4th sem. and 5th sem was ðŸ’€.",
    "what could be the cutoffs for cnr and mrd",
    "Is it relative now? We had absolute grading and sone relative adjustment shit, but I think you can check how the grading is done for the percentage on the back side of the grade card, but I think there might be some round off in play, for the grades to improve that high.",
    "Sometimes due to some malfunction this happens. I think the threshold is low in which you don't need to worry."
