  "content": "Dear coffee-enjoying human of the 4th Floor, I humbly apologize for the unexpected aerial assault that befell your shirt earlier today. It was not an act of malice but a tragic accident born from high-flying stress and poor aim. You see, life as a pigeon at ECC has become increasingly chaotic, grills everywhere, crumbs scarce, and open canteens practically inviting us like it's an Airbnb for birds. I was merely navigating the urban sky maze when natureâ€™s call turned into your fashion disaster. Please know it was never personal,my gastrointestinal outburst was purely circumstantial. May your detergent be strong, your coffee untainted in the future, and may the management finally acknowledge that we pigeons aren't just freeloading feathery fiends, we're desperate squatters in a poorly planned aviary. Sincerely sorry (and slightly embarrassed)",
