    "15 july is the last date to surrender the seat.  \nmeans in round 2 there is no go back. you won't get your money back.  \neither take the seat or leave it.\n\nso if u have JEE rank card generated then attend the counselling on 20 july with required DD and documents.\n└── What about people who registered after round 1 , window  to upload scorecard is still closed\n    └── Same doubt bro.. any update?",
