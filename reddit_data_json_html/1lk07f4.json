    "well tbh we never made notes lol ...\n└── don't do what this guy did keeds",
    "Really depends on the professor atleast for first year",
    "Most of them dont allow in 1st year, ur allowed to use laptop/any device only in C and python class in the first year but if you get some chill prof u can do anything. From 2nd year onwards you can use anything you want(some profs are exceptions tho)",
    "Only some allow , Most of the teachers who allow are the ones using to code something. Like C/Python/DS/WT",
    "for first year apart from python and c you cant take notes for anything on laptop. \n\nunless you pay attention in evs and constitution classes, and you take notes in that like a maniac",
    "As long as u don’t like your laptop u can take notes🫁🫀🏍️🗣️",
    "you can use ipad in class for taking notes\n├── though\\*\\*\n└── Are all professors chill with that?",
    "Ask nicely and beforehand and most professors should be okay with it. Especially if you're Sitting on the first bench",
    "Laptop depends on prof, but you can use a tablet if you have one",
    "It depends on the teacher."
