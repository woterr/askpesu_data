I dont know what to study at this point :(  Please help ",

    "45% of the weightage of the marks is given to classwork problems, and most of the remaining problems in the paper are pretty close to the class work problems level. if you do those classwork problems properly, or just mug the steps and answers for all those questions in fact, i think you’ll do just fine\n└── Pls help!  \nI have got a backlog in maths 2 in sem2 the registrations for july backlog were closed before sem 2 results came.
