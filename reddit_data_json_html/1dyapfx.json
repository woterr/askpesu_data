    "Explore different programming languages and choose one. Learn basics of that language clearly.\nOnce u are comfortable with the language then start DSA. DSA is very for placements. Also most of the people just study Computer Networks and Operating System for exam purpose in their Semesters. But understand the concepts very deeply Cuz CN and OS are also important for placements. I also suggest to start WEB dev.\n\nAll the best !!\n└── Thank you so much",
