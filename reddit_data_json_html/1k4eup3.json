    "yo you gota clarify if its 153/200 or 153/230\n\nIn each case:-\n\n153/200 - You'll need around 31+ in ISA2 average and around 82+ in ESA's to get A grade in all subjects\n\n153/230 - 36 avg in isa2's and 84+ in all esa's for around 9.0ish\n\n(considered around 9-10 in all internals )\n└── did you consider the lab marks for 5 credit courses? if no then add 20 to the total and divide by 1.2",
    "short answer : yes\n\nlong answer : depends\n└── That was such a long answer",
