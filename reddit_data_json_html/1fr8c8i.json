    "I mean, what happens if you miss an isa? You get zero on it",
    "Calm down\nYou'll be awarded zero marks (and marked absent), you can appear for isa 2 and esa \nAnd final grade will be based on zero(isa1) + isa2 + esa\nSo relax they won't fail you",
    "Wdym u slept through ur alarm?",
    "I think you are not a day scholar if you have been a day scholar this thing wouldn't have happened in your life.\n└── That depends on a lot of shit, like did he forget the exam or was sleeping so yeah, because being a hosteler he would have went home for some urgent shit else he will never miss an exam I have seen so many days scholars missing exams"
