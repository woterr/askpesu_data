    "I remember this app being circulated even in my first year, glad to see it is still there lmao\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Yaa free Netflix it was supposed to give ðŸ˜‚.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ But in my class it was serious, a girl opened it during math class, and she started crying bitterly, coz she couldn't stop it...\nâ””â”€â”€ Glad ah?",
    "Lol this happened in my class, and thankfully  the teacher was a ds teacher , she knew it wasn't his  faultðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜­,but i still dont get it, doesnt the app require some settings permissions to override do not disturb?\nâ””â”€â”€ Playing media doesn't really depend on Do Not Disturb. All it does is keep increasing the volume to max and starts moaning like shit. I fished through the app's files and realised that the app doesn't even have an Indian origin, it's Chinese. The scripts were compiled .Lua files, so i couldn't read them.\n\nEdit: Who's a ds teacher?\n    â”œâ”€â”€ Data structures teacher, ds is a course in 2nd year\n    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Oo okay\n    â””â”€â”€ I think you can open lua files in an editor. Lua is a programming language\n        â””â”€â”€ I know it dude, but the content in the Lua files are encoded in base 64. When I decrypt them, it just returns random non-renderable characters..",
    "Bruh someone sent this in my college's groups too, under the title of 'phys midsem marks' lol"
