    "AFAIK if you change your type of seat they only refund excess amount or ask for the makeup amount. You dont have to pay again just have need all your documents.\n└── So I am allowed to change like that?\n    └── Yup also if you dont like your branch again later you can change in 2nd year.\n        └── I mean from different campus of pesu to different course is it possible ? Initially through pesu counsel and then through kea if I get through\n            └── Ya as long as its pes university and not pes college of engineering there are no issues with all this stuff. Idk if you have to pay to kea or pes for that seat but if its kea then theyll refund 5L and u need to pay the new fees probably (im not through kcet). But dont worry pes always gives back due money of admission pretty fast. I got mine back within a few weeks I think.\n                └── Thanks"
