    "What exactly are you struggling with?\n└── Details of my father are getting copied in my mothers , like whatever o put in my father's detail they get copied directly. I tried chaging my mothers after a few seconds it goes back to normal\n    └── Try manually re-entering your mothers details?\n\n(I filled it out too and didn't come across this problem)\n        └── I tried that already more than 10 times\n            └── Contact their support team/helpline then\n                └── Did"
