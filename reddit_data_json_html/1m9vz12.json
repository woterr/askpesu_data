    "If you are getting core CSE in pes ec, then honestly you should put only rvce CSE and pes CSE above that; Nothing else. The cse+something , branches pretty new in all colleges, so there is not much record of how the graduated batches have performed in terms of placement. Also, they are still at the beginning stages. So if you are thinking about giving a priority to CSE+with something over CSE just give a thought about it.\n├── I got pes ecity cse too did exactly that\n├── I personally told OP exactly this on dm a day ago. Oh well.\n└── good luck with \\~2200 CSE students only",
    "Only put rr cse and rvce cse above ecc cse.\nBms and msrit are shit.\n└── but bmsce placements seem good this year is choosing pes ecc any good?\n    └── I would take pes over bms any day.\nEven ecc has good coding culture and shit.\nPlus a much better syllabus than vtu.",
    "If u want less academic pressure and more freedom, pes rr all the way",
    "Be Patient . Wait till the 3rd Round No Matter What .  \nYou can add like RVCE(CSE) , RVCE(AIML) , RVCE(ECE)\\[if interested\\] , PESU RR(CSE) above the PES EC(CSE)\n\nSJCE , Mysore is also pretty good now a days . If you are interested , that is an option too .\n└── SJCE they didn't publish placements of last 2 years are you sure\n    ├── 100% brother . I've got many seniors and also classmates who've studied/studying there\n    └── As I've heard , the coding culture is crazy in SJCE\n        └── okk I got JSSSTU in first round so ima proceed ig although I did think of putting bmsce"
