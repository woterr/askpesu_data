    "Just a suggestion: please work extra hard in Sushmaâ€™s class. She may come across as a tough person but sheâ€™s actually worser. She canâ€™t teach for shit ðŸ˜­. Never connect with her personally, sheâ€™ll gossip with you till your ears bleedðŸ˜­\nâ””â”€â”€ \\+1 can confirm. Was my prof for information security. Had the worst time with her.",
    "Sushma + Anand deadly combo. You will be facing hell for one semester. Both are retards, they think that they are experts but in reality they aren't.",
    "Chetana is very sweet n friendly. Has decent knowledge. Anand is also approachable, he has good tips regarding best practices in industry n stuff like that. Also a good teacher for DSA. Long as u don't bother them too much, they won't trouble you.",
    "Gayathri is rlyy good. She teaches well and doesnt rly care what you do in class so you wont have any problems with her",
    "can personally attest for chetana, listen in her class and do what she tells u to do, S grade guaranteed"
