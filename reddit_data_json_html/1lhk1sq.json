  "content": "I have my Mechanics ESA tommorow. So naturally, I was looking for a way to kill time. Ended up drawing a few manga panels. Yes, it's on the back of my Mechanics notebook. I don't know what I was thinking when I drew it (was definitely high on something). I just made a panel layout and drew whatever would fit in each panel. It ended up looking pretty good for a mindless, time pass sketch. I thought the title \"Dream Crushed (Dore-Ä«mu Kurusshu)\" was pretty fitting lol. Posting it here, so it may be engrained in the PESU Memes Hall fo Fame.\n\nP.S.: Best of luck to everyone who has ESAs ongoing right now!",

    "This is great! \n\nA suggestion to make the Japanese look better since the rest of it looks fire. For ãƒ‰ãƒªãƒ¼ãƒ ã‚¯ãƒ©ãƒƒã‚·ãƒ¥, the ãƒƒ and ãƒ¥ are small kana so they should be a bit smaller and slightly below the other characters. \n\nAnd for Speedbird-ãƒ¯ãƒ³ (wan), it looks like youâ€™ve written ãƒ¯ã‚½ (waso) instead. You can make the curve slightly flatter (ãƒ³ instead ã‚½) and your name is perfect.\nâ””â”€â”€ Thank you for pointing that out. I am not familiar with the Japanese writing system. I just used Google Translate and tried my best to copy the characters. I'll be sure to take note of that.\n    â”œâ”€â”€ No worries then. You actually did a superb job just from copying. Quite a challenging writing system for sure.\n    â””â”€â”€ Drop a yt tutorial with your goated skills"
