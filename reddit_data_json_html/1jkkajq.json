    "8/10 for food. Biriyani hits the spot ngl. It's a banger 🗣️💥💯\nThe only drawback is if you could wait without turning into a dried mummified skeleton by the time your food reaches you, prolly you're good to go. \nHail to the pixel biriyani 🗣️💥💯👍",
    "Pes ec campus pixel canteen shawarma is the best!!\n└── With za bebsi 👍\n(We don't have bebsi in pixel )\n    ├── iconic references\n    └── Eat with tropicana mixed fruit juice ☠️",
    "It's decent...you only can know.",
    "EC campus pixel canteen, food truck and the mrd student center cafeteria are good,\nPixel ain't the most aesthetic place tho.\n├── what do u even get in food truck\n│   └── Bun samosa, parota etc\nAlso they sell those sugarless cool drinks.\n└── Not aesthetic but the best place for food ! (No offence to food truck). Special mention of pixel chai!!. It's literally the best chai u can get - (iykyk)\nMrd canteen is very neat and pizza is great ! 😃"
