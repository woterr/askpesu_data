    "&gt;a third one just took place 10 mins back\n\nThere isn't much information on this yet: there is also news coming out that it was just an accident. Best to not discuss or speculate until we hear more valid information. \n\nYou're jumping on the s\\*icide bandwagon without any evidence just to stir up hate against the university because apparently its looks cool for this generation to do so.\n├── I don't have anything personal against the university and I'm not trying to look cool or anything, it's better that I'm wrong but what abt the rest of the suicides at pes they were definitely covered up by the university right?\n│   └── If the information was made public and acknowledged by PES, it isn't called covering up. Know the difference.\n\nAll previous incidents were known to the public mere hours after it happened. There was news coverage on them within 24 hours, which included PES' statements. None of this is \"covering up\". \n\nIt would have been covered up if PES did not acknowledge it or actually hushed the matter over.\n│       └── Stop the dickriding🗣️🗣️\n\n\n&gt;All previous incidents were known to the public mere hours after it happened. There was news coverage on them within 24 hours, which included PES' statements. None of this is \"covering up\". \n\nSurvivorship bias\nThey failed to cover up the last one, they released press statements once the situation was out of hand. \n\nWe shouldn't jump to conslusions yes, but if it is a suicide then Pes will obviously try to cover this shit up, they'd be retarded not to.\n│           ├── Exactly. There have been 2 suicides in my campus already and PES hasn't given us an official statement saying they're sorry or changed anything at all. They're just trying to forget about it and move in because it affects their brand and reputation. I don't see a point in defending their actions. The only reason I got to know was through my frnds. Shouldn't PES at least say ok this has happened, let's try to find out why and change some stuff or smtg? No. We haven't even been asked if there's anything bothering us and the mentor program is still worthless. At least this one they can't change into an accident because it'll look even worse on the college if a student had an accident because of their poor infrastructure. 4 suicides in less than 1 year is horrible man\n│           │   └── sorry for what ?\n│           ├── This is peak dick riding😭 just because one person has a good opinion on this clg doesn't mean others also follow the same. Future students that want to join should know abt such cases before they take admission because this clg asks fees the second they offer seat, it is a business and last thing students need is more toxicity for another 4 years of their life\n│           │   └── You're mistaken if you think I have only good opinions on this University. I criticise and praise where necessary. I stay as objective and neutral as I can in all my answers and don't let emotions get in the way. Go through my answers. You'll always find both sides of the argument (and sometimes, most of them negative ones). \n\nCurrently there are way too many that blindly hate this place without concrete reasons. Showing off your hate for this place on social media doesn't make you look cool. Stop making this subreddit an echo chamber. Most of you just hate PES from day 1 without them having done anything to you.\n\nSecondly, nobody mentioned about not notifying prospective students about these incidents. But you're making it sound like all people do here is suffer. Every University is a business and PES is no different. This place makes a lot of bad decisions but it also gets a lot of things right which most colleges don't.\n│           │       └── &gt;  \nCurrently there are way too many that blindly hate this place without concrete reasons. Showing off your hate for this place on social media doesn't make you look cool. Stop making this subreddit an echo chamber. Most of you just hate PES from day 1 without them having done anything to you.\n\nBest paragraph ever written on this subreddit.\n│           └── You're strongly opinionated out of hate for the university that they will always try to cover up any incident because you think they're the \"bad people\". PES surely deserves criticism for the bad decisions, but there are way too many blinded out of emotion that this place is downright hell on earth.\n\nI'm in no way a blind supporter of everything PES does. If you think all I do is ride on PESU's dick, you can check out all the past criticism I've posted about PES. It's all publicly accessible for you to see.\n│               └── Gonna agree with you buddy, the uni is not all good or all bad. \n\nIt seems like the teachers here love to go on a power trip, thus causing these things.\n├── Here u go https://www.reddit.com/r/bangalore/s/b0B6ll8vgZ\n└── And now that its been confirmed, was it wrong to jump on the bandwagon when clearly this was caused by pes?\n    └── Still not enough information to conclude it was on PES. \n\nAnd lmao wtf is wrong with you. You're literally advocating for \"guilty until proven innocent\". Regardless of what the outcome is, whether it's for this incident or any other, never jump to conclusions. It's always best to wait for all the information to be released before processing it and making an informed decision on who is at fault. \n\nIt's not guilty unless proven innocent, it's the other way round.\n        ├── Bro how much is pes paying u da seriously u know how their business works u aren't their lawyer to argue with us from a legal standpoint, if you were in that kids place they would have done the same bs to u that time will u defend them?? If u check the link I sent the student has jumped from the same spot that ANOTHER kid recently had! Legit the same spot !! And he's done it cuz they didn't let him write an exam cuz he's late even though some leniency wouldn't have killed them, they continued classes after a fucking kid has died in front of them no remorse nothing don't be as cold hearted as corporate mfs you don't gain shit by defending their actions which has led to 4 fucking deaths\n        │   └── &gt;u aren't their lawyer to argue with us from a legal standpoint,\n\nFirstly, you aren't even a student here. I know PES better than you ever will. So stop being a clown and pulling accusations out of your ass. You're just here to stir up drama.\n\n&gt;And he's done it cuz they didn't let him write an exam cuz he's late even though some leniency wouldn't have killed them,\n\nThe rule states that you are not permitted more than 30 mins after the exam begins. This 30 mins *is* the leniency. How much more leniency do you expect in a 3 hour exam? An exam hall isn't your home where you can walk in whenever you feel like. You should be grateful that PES even *has* a leniency period of 30 mins.\n\nYou gave the JEE Mains this year right? Would love to see you walk up to your exam center 30 mins after the exam begins and then demand the security personnel to let you in. Do you think you would have been allowed to give the exam, knowing that a full year of effort is wasted? Would you blame yourself for arriving late or the security for not letting you in?\n\nHowever, as I stated: we do not have enough information to decide who is at fault. To actually know that, we need to know *how* late the student arrived. If they arrived &lt;30 mins before the exam, then I agree, action must be taken. But as of now, there is no info on this.\n\n&gt;you don't gain shit by defending their actions\n\nYou are right. That is why if you read my past comments about PES, I have been critical where due. As recently as a week or so ago when I posted why PES is not worth it, or a few months ago when I have posted numerous negative comments about the mismanagement, poor faculty etc at this university. I have always remained neutral and unbiased when it comes to giving feedback about PES, you would know this if you were regular on this subreddit.\n        │       └── Rowlet Ullu(owl), dont u u know that 3 professors working in PESU were chargesheeted by police in aditya prrabhu's case. PESU could not cover it up since many people knows what happenned on that day !!! proof is with police.\n        └── Here’s a glazed donut, last time it happened even the mother of the victims called out that they were actively trying to cover it up? And did they take any action against the person who mistreated the kid? NO, so they are actively complicit especially since this is the 3rd this year.\n            └── What you are saying has nothing to do with my comment. Maybe comprehend better.\n\nI was asked if it was wrong to jump to conclusions, to which I replied saying it is never right to jump to any conclusions without having the full details. If hypothetically today you were falsely accused of something you did not do, would you be okay with everyone jumping to the conclusion that you did it? Or would you rather be innocent until proven guilty?\n\nFYI - I fully agree that PES shit themselves with the Aditya Prabhu incident. Never denied it anywhere. Everything about it could have been handled better.\n                └── When there is a record of something happening once and when we know that they haven’t done anything to fix it, it is guilty until proven innocent. When a murderer is found in a suspicious position again it is always assumed that he is involved, the whole point of any offenders list like a sex offenders list is this, the uni is too powerful to be convicted but we sure as hell know that they have a record of pushing students to take such measures and also of trying to cover it up. So yes they are guilty until proven innocent and here we already know that they are guilty, an entire class room saw the boy jump and everyone know that he was denied writing the exam right before this happened, you are just riding at this point.\n                    └── Forgive me but I am someone who believes in having all the facts and making an informed decision before deciding who the culprit is. You are of course, free to have your own opinion on the matter.\n\n&gt;here we already know that they are guilty, an entire class room saw the boy jump and everyone know that he was denied writing the exam right before this happened\n\nI will iterate: we do not have enough information to decide this. We do not know *how* late the student arrived. That is what will actually determine who is at fault.\n\nCheck the ESA instructions which are always, before any ESA, emailed/sent over notifications. There is a clause that mentions that you will not be permitted 30 mins after the start time. If the student arrived within the stipulated time, I agree ([and have commented numerous times on another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/1crqziu/comment/l40w1a9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)), that the faculty is at fault and there should be consequences.\n\nHowever, if the student did arrive 30 mins after the start time, is the faculty at fault for carrying out his responsibility? Or is the student responsible for arriving late? If one day you arrived late for a job interview at the company of your dreams and they ended up skipping you, would you hold yourself responsible for being late, or would you blame the recruiter/company for being strict?\n                        └── Rowlet Ullu, you not having information does NOT mean that rest of the people also dont have information. what are you going to get by trying to argue with all of us who have more information that PESU was covering all these suicides up?",

    "just a doubt ? How is a suicide from 10 min ago ( as you said ) being covered up ?\n└── https://www.instagram.com/p/C68es6LsU8O/\n    ├── OMG 😰\n    └── The link is four hour old. Your post is 9 hr old. In your own word , it happened 10 min before your post and they were trying to cover up\n        └── You can clearly see they cleaned up the scene as soon as it happened, do you see any news outlets covering this? A suicide attempt is no small thing either and there's been 4 suicides in total but if you've read the comments here the university has never acknowledged it till they literally had no choice the first time it happened it made headlines but the remaining times it didn't it's literally being covered up to save the college's image\n            └── The second one wasnt related to the college right ? Idk about the third one , ik only three. correct me if i am wrong .  I was confused with this post coz you mentioned it happened 10 mins ago and they were tryna cover up \n\nanyway whats happening is bad . If what i read is true  which is there was an error in the pesuacademy or something, university is probably is to blame in this case unlike the other case where the fault was with the guy who took his phone . \n\nIf the pesuacademy fact is true , i dont see why you couldnt just tell the chairperson and get your test . \n\nas rude as it is , suicide is cowardly . Especially with these reasons",
    "what a fuckall place man, disgusted to study here",
    "There is no point spreading information, this was done last two times too, only and i am saying this again, only way to make it stop is all pf you students standing together and fighting this, protesting until an action is taken, if ten of you protest they can kick you out, may be 20 too but not in 100s if all of you do it together they will have to address the issue. Unless you do that, this will keep continuing.",
    "How legitimate is this info!?\n└── The student jumped during college hours there was atleast an entire class that witnessed the suicide attempt with their own eyes",
    "It's sus",
    "Any way uk the person names ? Or anything that might be helpful strict action have to been taken against the college what about the parents",
    "Guys just fucking stop. At this point it’s not the college it’s the fucking students who are not mature enough to take on certain things. If someone decides to take their life because they can’t keep up with COLLEGE pressure then I’m sorry to say but they are just pussies. I’m 19 years old and made the decision to go abroad for studies and have been living by myself for almost a year now, making a living alongside getting good grades at university. If the kids at PES say that their college puts too much pressure on them then they have no idea what life can do. Never has the any thought relating to suicide ever crossed my mind even at my lowest. So the next time someone tries to say they are facing college pressure please take a good look around with your fucking eyes. You have no idea how easy your life is if the only “pressure” on you is by your college/university.\n├── if you've never related to suicide, please consider yourself extremely lucky, and know that not everybody is as lucky as you. there could be a million reasons for somebody to take this step, reasons that you may not be able to think of or comprehend (again, lucky for you). I think for a person to take their own life is by no means an easy decision, and it is definitely not our (your) position to judge somebody for it. if you do not have anything good or comforting to say (I don't think your comment does either of these), sometimes it's much easier and better to just shut up :)\n│   └── Damn! GG dude\n├── &gt; I’m 19 years old and made the decision to go abroad for studies\n\nWhy d f are you in this sub?\n└── See you got a point. But teenagers these days are depressed for something or another and their mental health is ruined. College in particular peers/ faculty might just be the point which makes it a saturation or too much to take. \nAlso your point of going abroad to study was also your choice and you sound sort of complaining about it.\nI might be totally wrong in this case.\nBut the baseline is no one knows about the happenings of another's life until we are put in their shoes.\nLet's not be judgemental. \nNo one life is perfect, all of us have hardships be it at work place or home or educational institution or anywhere on Earth.\nIt's the way we deal with it that matters.\nPS: On an ending note, just watch the suicide scenario in 3 idiots.",
