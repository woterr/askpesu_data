  "content": "Earlier when we'd go to important dates section, it showed a possible 2nd round in July 2025 but now it is removed. Looks like it won't happen. This is so bad, didn't even get the chance to appear and lost 1200 rs too. Also in some other post on the sub, someone did comment that very less seats were surrendered so 2nd round has been cancelled, which kinda validates. Tough luck, i have :)",

    "normally it gets postponed like a million times (happened with my batch too) but a 2nd round will definitely happened and probably after kcet 1st round",
    "actually we can actually sue them if they do that , we can say that we missed admission to other college because of this , also we paid money for second round\n├── If the round is canceled they will refund your money\n│   └── it is cancelled but i doubt they will refund because they can say it is for round 1\n│       └── What ,the fee??\n│           └── yes\n│               └── Nh the y wont\n└── all the best suing",
    "15 july last date h surrender krne ke liye, probably uske baad jitni seats bachegi uske hisab se karwayenge 2nd round.\n└── it's for kcet students, my parent's friend who spoke with management told so",
    "It is happening on 20th July I got the message\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l1w1e6ur12cf1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a273b387d7a77fcef638d09567886174c1888e7d\n\nUpvote 🙏🏻\n└── Wow",
    "confirmed not happening ?",
    "15 july last date h surrender krne ke liye, probably uske baad jitni seats bachegi uske hisab se karwayenge 2nd round.\n└── I read somewhere ki 1 round of jee counseling ki seat jo surrender ho gyi hai wo kcet counseling me consider krenge\n    └── Nahi aisa nahi krenge woh kabhi v, kcet ki seats 40% h sayad aur fee kam lgta h kcet se admission lene pe, woh log khud kyu apna loss karayenge. Aur aisa hota toh round 1 of jee mains ke baad kyu open krte round 2 ke liye registration through jee mains.\n        └── Round 2 mein PES has already declared merit list based on KCET score. So the second round admission will happen on PESU KCET ranking and not based PESU JEE ranking.\n.The seats for PESU KCET ranking will come from the seats surrendered by round 1 candidates ( PESU JEE RANKERS). This category has 45% seats.\n\nAnother 40% seats are allocated for KCET KEA ranking.The admission for these seats are done by Govt.i.e KEA\n            └── yes you're right",
    "No way",
    "it's not because very less seats surrendered, they had included both cet and jee as ways of entering now they are using cet rank card instead\n└── Then why did they open applications for JEE again after round 1?\n    └── because they previously decided to hold a round 2 but now instead decided to use only cet rank cards, idk why",
