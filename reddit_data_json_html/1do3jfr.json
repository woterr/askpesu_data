    "You can find placement stats for 2024, 2023 and 2022 batches here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/1ct5ujc/comment/l49p42j/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/1ct5ujc/comment/l49p42j/)\n\nThese are maintained by students and are mostly accurate - you will see that these are similar to the metrics advertised by PES. I know the people who maintained them for every batch so I can vouch for these being fairly accurate.",
    "Pes University is known for not giving too much information on placements statistics so i don't think there's many ways to find out\n└── it's true tho isn't it? why are you being downvoted lol. this goes for mostly all pvt colleges but except the student provided data pes indeed doesn't share any kind of statistics on their website.\n    └── Yeah lmao idk why it got downvoted, find me any piece of information PES themselves have given about their placements and I'll downvote it myself"
