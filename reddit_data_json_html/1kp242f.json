    "Core subjects remain same as cse but electives change according to a senior I talked with .\n└── Can you tell me which subjects are the core subjects\n    └── Software engineering, DBMS , ML\n        └── Thank you!!\n            └── Since the core courses are the same, it would be easier for you to look up the syllabus on the PES website. I believe they still have it out up there (although it'll be an old syllabus)",
    "Yo bro, I'm wondering if the syllabus for cse ,and aiml in 1st year(1st sem and 2nd sem) same?? I'm joining pesu this year, and it's really help a lot, considering I might change branch (based on experience) , all I want is y/n answer if possible, thank you\n└── Yes"
