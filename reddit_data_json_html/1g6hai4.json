    "About 5 months (Jan-May, Aug-Dec) https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/s/xJZABkuelc\n\nPicked it from the FAQs :)\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Wait a min cllg started in aug wth? Bruh how far back is the 3 rd round kcet batch?\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ No it didn't, it's been delayed this year. \n\nMy answer is specifically if the session starts and ends on time. Read the answer.\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ Got it thanks bro\nâ”œâ”€â”€ will there be a shuffle in classes after 1st sem?\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Yep. Once after 1st, another one after 2nd.\nâ”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ THANK THE HEAVENS\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ Will there be a shuffle in classes after the first sem? U sure?\nâ”‚           â””â”€â”€ Usually happens when KCET students join after PESSAT. Given it happened this time, there should be shuffling.\nâ”‚               â””â”€â”€ This is too bad. I actually found a good group of friends, man. I guess we will separate if this happens. T_T\nâ””â”€â”€ And 3 if you get hit by a pandemic :)",
    "13 weeks\nâ””â”€â”€ So by Jan this first sem will end?\n    â””â”€â”€ Yes by jan end.Â \n        â””â”€â”€ will there be a shuffle after 1st sem?\n            â””â”€â”€ Yes. Just a minor shuffle to accommodate the kcet guys. Right now they are in seperate sections.Â \n                â””â”€â”€ do u think the kcet peeps feel out of place that time?ðŸ˜­\n                    â””â”€â”€ You will feel out of place if you constantly keep thinking about it and don't put in an effort to get along",
