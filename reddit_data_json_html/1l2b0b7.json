    "You will need to take a call based on the ongoing projects, if they match your interests and profs. Or if you cannot find their ongoing projects, look at their past work. \n\nAlso revisiting this earlier discussion: https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/s/hEqVBdv0Yj\n\nI have submitted a research proposal for which I would be the mentor (if people are interested and they approve it). You'll know it's me once you see the proposal (I think, idk how it works right now)."
