    "Things might have changed since my time, but in my year, like 10-15% of the batch got a 3rd year campus internship (companies like GS, Flipkart, Microsoft, Akamai, etc from what I remember). Probably like 6-7% of the batch got a full time offer from these internships, thatâ€™s it. Not all of these companies even gave PPOs. So everyone else was sitting for placements when the time came. \n\nAll the same companies came again later, so nothing to worry about. Start prepping DSA now so you can ace it once internship+full time placements begin\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Now it's a blood bath for internship, I remember last year we got asked Partition DP stuff so many times in OAs\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Now the situation is crazy; Hardly 1-2% get internships on campus and most of them won't even get converted also\nâ””â”€â”€ Could i DM you? If you don't mind\n    â””â”€â”€ Sure. Feel free"
