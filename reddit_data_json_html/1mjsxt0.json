    "It *is* exactly that. Although, they don't really care if you show up or not. Usually you only get summoned if your grades are really poor.",
    "Its not compulsory to attend",
    "They do have a ptm, but it’s not like the ones in schools, it’s not compulsory ( usually they send invites to your parents mail id)",
    "U don't have to attend if u don't want to",
    "It's scheduled but it's not mandatory we attend. I never attended",
    "My parents are the type of people who'd probably go either way lol.\n└── Tbh it's not wrong for the teachers to meet our parents, the only problem is when they don't see us as adults and treat us like children"
