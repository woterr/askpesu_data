    "Pes isn't that strict about dress code u can wear anything below knee length ....the only time they are strict about dress code is during exam time\n└── Alright, thanks a lot",
    "As long as it's a decent dress no one will care. I showed up in jeans and teeshirts with a jacket (in cold months)\n\nNo crop tops...some teachers will scold. \n\nNo sleevless for the same reason, no tight clothes"
