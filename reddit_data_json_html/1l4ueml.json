    "I think there is. Ask on the main discord server. Someone can share the link to your batch discord server on that. There have been previous discussions on this so I am pretty sure it exists.\n└── I can't talk in the main discord server without the PES login credentials which I don't have. \n    └── You can post in Ask a Senior or the other channels part of the incoming students forum. All of those channels are accessible.\n\nI'm asking you to post there asking about your batch server. I believe there's already a discussion there."
