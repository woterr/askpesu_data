  "content": "I was thinking of going for reval for a few subjects but before applying I just wanted to know if they took rel grading in any of those. I have to go for reval directly this time as I am in my hometown directly and can't see my score. The 1st years (B.Tech) who went for script review recently, could you please comment down the total you got in 100 (ISA+assignment+ESA) along with the grade in Math and Mechanical ? ",
