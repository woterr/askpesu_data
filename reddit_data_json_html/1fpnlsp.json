    "Your teachers will probably send you a pdf of the textbook, it’s easy enough to find if they don’t and you can xerox that if you want or just use it as a pdf",
    "Don't buy any book, it's pointless. Focusing in the class is all you need.",
    "srk iyengar is good imo for 1st sem.. but don't buy it, just borrow it from the lib\n└── I went to the library today to borrow books... apparently u can't borrow till we get new id cards\n    └── They'll be giving them out next week according to what I heard",
    "honestly for the first year....you dont need any textbooks just refer to the slides provided and assignments in the pesuacademy website....they are more than enough",
    "Practice CW problems diligently which teacher would do in class and Question bank uploaded in pesuacademy and could use Higher Engineering mathematics by BS Grewal . You would hardly need to solve  textbook . CW problems are more than enough\n└── I have locked the seat and am waiting for the second round extended results to be out. I don't have login access to pesuacademy. I thought I would sit at home and practice some meth cuz I am hella weak.\n    ├── Pesu changes syllabus every year here and there. Better wait for college to begin .\nThough you can start practicing partial Differentiation\n    └── Just download bs Grewal textbook for maths and rest all subjects pesu Academy slides."
