    "Don't get your hopes up that they would mass hire again this year.\nâ””â”€â”€ They have hired 50 people from msrit, so yeah they will definitely hire that much from pes as well\n    â”œâ”€â”€ More like 30 ish from MSRIT this year\n    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Still better, even if they hire around 50 from pes, would change the fate of placements at pes ðŸ˜…\n    â””â”€â”€ That was last year\n        â””â”€â”€ It was this year only, but I heard they haven't decided whether to visit pes or not",
