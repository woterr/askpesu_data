    "1. Laptop. \nBuy one suitable for your course and your budget. Ideally with good battery life and support. A LGBTQ friendly industrial oven that sounds like a Honda redlining at 34kmph when you try to do anything is going to lose it's charm after a while.\n\nI'm not too into laptops, I'm sure people are here to help.\n\n2. Bag\nGet one laptop bag that can also carry stuff for an overnighter.\n\n3. Books \nIdk if they still provide a multisubject notebook, but if they do, it should mostly cover a semester of notes.\nAll your textbooks are available online, unless you're that someone adamant on getting physical copies. You get second hand books.\n\nAnd maybe a pen.\n└── Thx",
    "Aside from whatever is already mentioned, you'll also need a scientific calculator. The most popular choice here is the Casio 991ex model. Supports everything you'll need for the math courses as well as a few other ones.",
