  "content": "Standing in a packed metro, no seat, sweating in this scorching heat with zero energy\n\nJust finished ESA for 6th sem and signed off ISA final marks today. No clue if I’ll pass Compiler Design unless they pull off some mercy-level relative grading.\n\nNow it’s “summer break”—no internship yet, placements around the corner, and my brain’s just fried.\n\nThought I was done with this college. Nope. Still stuck in the loop.\n",
