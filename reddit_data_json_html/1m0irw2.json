Paying hefty fees and still not getting a .edu email IDsl?\n│   ├── Such is life\n\n![gif](giphy|6sxe09T4u3bjgATWlm)\n│   │   └── https://i.redd.it/ul1g0hbjr1df1.gif\n│   └── Also, I heard that once you finish your degree in PES, they are deleting the accounts.   \n\n\nI remember a senior regretting saving all his important links in his edu mail, and finally, his access to that account was revoked after he graduated\n│       └── Yup. You will lose access to it sometime after you graduate. Its only a temporary bonus.\n│           └── Will they give a warning before it happens? I still have a lot of stuff on my pes gdrive\n│               └── Nope. One day, you will try to log in and be like:\n\n![gif](giphy|3o72F8t9TDi2xVnxOE)\n\n(you won't even be able to log in)\n│                   └── Imagine someone who has kept important data on that lmao\n└── Do they provide it to Btech students?\n    └── They used to",
