    "bruh this isnt vtu\n└── Wdym\n    └── I think he means that in vtu colleges pyqs are repeated directly in the papers but not here\n        └── I heard this was the case here too, which was why we don't get access to previous year esa papers.\n            └── lol the only use of pyqs here is to get some practice and feel of the level of questions asked. Every year brand new questions are framed. You have to study the entire syllabus properly if you want to stand a chance at scoring 80+ in esa here",
