    "You can't pick a random prof. You need to mention what your research interests are and then someone can guide you to the relevant profs. This isn't a game where you throw everything at the wall and hope something sticks.",
    "Dr. Gowri could be a good person to seek out and ask for help.  Check with Prof. Sathya prasad (CIE), Prof. Aditya or Vadiraja (from the IoT Team - 11th Flr) if they can help."
