    "How is related to placements?\n└── High GPA = Better chance at getting shortlisted\n    └── not true, depends on skills, resume etc,,\n        └── the entry criteria for 80 % of the companies is cgpa",
    "Just focus in class. I got 9.6 it was new to me also I usually get around 9 the only difference is 3rd sem subjects are fun if you study in class. Yes even ddco ((T_T)). Afll solve everything ddco and webt start preparing weeks before mcse and dsa are easy.",
    "For AFLL, Prakash sir's notes helped me a lot. Anurag's notes for WT, and slides/QB for MCSE. Textbook is a must for DDCO. Slides were enough for DSA, along with the codes our teacher gave in class.\n\nListening in class and solving/coding along with the teacher, and some revision starting a week before, were enough for me to get a 9.5+\n└── Do you have any links to the ones you mentioned?",
