    "Lyrics:  \nY'all gully smokers, hiding like stress won't phase ya?\n\nYâ€™all embarrassed of 'em, thatâ€™s not right, that ain't how mama raised us.\n\nTake that mask off, I wanna see what's under them achievements\n\nWhy believe you? Ain't seen nothin' special from your campus\n\n'Cause you lied about your clubs, you lied about their sponsorships\n\nYou lied about Placements, faked it to secure your place.\n\nYou hide about Shubham, you hide about management\n\nThey all pussy, he paid 'em off just to save face.\n\nYou lied about campus life, you lied about your AT, huh\n\nYou lied about Aditya Prabhu, 60Cr could keep it low\n\nYou lied about campus when you ainâ€™t got the size to show\n\nFuck main campus, you gonna rot in PES",
