    "The market is correcting itself slowly but calling it significantly improved would be exaggerating. There are more roles out there now than a year ago and many well-known MNCs have slowly resumed actively hiring. Many companies are also moving their workforce to different (cheaper) locations like India. There are multiple open positions now. But it still isn't the same as it used to be a few years ago. \n\nPlus, the number of applicants to these roles has also been exponentially increasing every year so competition is also at an all-time high. So while you could say the market has improved, your chances are probably still about the same because everyone is trying to get into these positions.\n├── do you have any clue what percentage of 2024 batch got placed?\n│   └── There was a picture that went around on discord. You will have better luck asking there.\n└── 2028 tak sab theeeo ho jayea"
