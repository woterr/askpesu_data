  "content": "So I've noticed for a while that the placements for the 2025 batch have been going on even now with some tier 1 companies still coming for recruitment. I was confused as to how this work.\n\nLike aren't we supposed to be doing internships between the Jan-June period. Those who get it through placements do it in their respective companies but the rest have to be doing it in PESU labs right? (and prepare for the placements at the same time). So let's say I get in one of these companies in March and they want me to work. Can I leave the PESU internship or have to complete it. And would working from March to June be sufficient for the credits?",

    "i think u need to complete minimum 3 months to get the credits from any internship.   \nlets say u complete 3 months, get the internship credits. then u can switch to your company one from PESU labs.  \nif u dont want to continue  in PES Labs , you can switch to the company and intern for 3 months.\nâ””â”€â”€ Got it. Also is it every year that these companies keep coming this late even after one graduates? Like I didn't think they'd come till July\n    â””â”€â”€ yeah they come , but they are usually tier 3 companies.\n        â””â”€â”€ https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SnSNM_GnuTwIJ0oI3bHt9nAnDQXfqwIhT8JHEwq727g/edit?gid=0#gid=0\n\nThis is the sheet I was referring to. Saw quite a few tier 1 companies here.\n            â””â”€â”€ I meant to say tier 3 companies come at the end , some exceptions ofc"
