    "Choose what really interests you, since you mentioned that your main priority is job. Its relatively harder to get a job with ece as not many ece specific companies visit the college for placements and syllabus is tougher. But you can change your branch to cse after 1st year if there are seats available and your cgpa meets the cutoff which would be about 9 cgpa. You can also take up cse minor courses but it will get too hectic. Otherwise you can opt for cse at bvb",
