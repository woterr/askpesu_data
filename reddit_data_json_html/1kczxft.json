    "Shilpa ruined the subject for you guys... It's a beautiful subject, one of my favorites. \n\nIt's too late for ISA but I'd suggest going through the textbook and staying as far as possible from those atrocious slides",

    "Guys me as a senior i understand your frustration esa will be way worse we literally got 1.5 days you guys atleast have 2.5 days study, properly and just get out of that shit hole after that you will start feeling light in the 5 and 6 th semesters, so yeah just get out of it the only time my gpa went down from 8.7 to 8.17 was 4th"
