  "content": "Many a times, teachers dont give attendance to students just because they didnt answer the question correctly or were talking with some or forgot to answer their attendance immediatly, (happened to me where, i didnt get attendence because i answer my attendece just a second late). Do you think its right for teachers to use attendence as levrage ? or do you think its just a power trip? when many of us are stressed about even maintaining 75 and not getting attendece even after attending class is fkd up. \n\n(just asking yall opinion, sorry if u disagree.)",
