    "I guess PES provides bus facilities as given in the website.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dn38kwoi4f6f1.jpeg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fcd98dcbb67150aee3f08e6004a331d0260b85c0\nâ””â”€â”€ Nahh you can buy a vehicle rather than opting bus and are they serious with that amount\n    â””â”€â”€ True ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­",
    "if you have travel time like 1 to 2 hours or even more , its better to take hostel or pg. You ll get exhausted after coming to home. For bus info [check here](https://pes.edu/admissions/transportation/)\nâ””â”€â”€ Leaving my local for a clg nahh.But thanks for the info I'll check that",
    "After admission process I saw the transportation fees.its better u opt for some other mode of transport 1st year and buy a vehicle for the remaining years it's too expensive.\nâ””â”€â”€ yes i was shocked after seeing the bus fee"
