    "There's no objective difference between campuses. Same degree, same placements, similar peers. Check the FAQs for the other subjective difference. EC has more open spaces, better tech clubs, but RR has better infra, bigger fests (although I'll add in that you can always attend fests at any campus), more clubs (not better though). At the end of the day, both campuses will provide you with the same opportunities and degree. What will differ is the experience. Also, campus life depends largely on what you make of it, your socialising abilities, and how you adapt to PES. People come in here expecting a college life from a Hollywood movie and get disappointed. If you can't make friends, constantly think about the fact that you could've been in some other campus/college or don't make the most of what you have, you'll never be happy anywhere. The grass always looks greener on the other side. \n\nBesides, the campus is going to affect you for 3 years; the branch you choose today sticks with for your life. Now which is more important?",
    "Wdym you cant survive ec campus bro? YOU HAVENT EVEN JOINED ?",
    "This really boils down to what you expect from your \"college life\". Regardless of which campus you end up in, you will still have to deal with the fact that you're in PES. It's going to be academically rigorous, and most of the time you'll be cussing the college out rather than your campus. \n\nIt's already been answered in the FAQ's, but there is quite literally no difference in the campuses. RR has more intake, so sure you might find your crowd there, but it doesn't mean that EC has a \"bad\" crowd. The buildings are newer in RR, so if the college life you are picturing involves looking at fancy buildings, go ahead, take whichever course you get there. \n\nEven if you don't get the chance to switch to the course you want now, at the end of the first year, you'll be allowed to switch courses/campuses based on your cgpa. If you truly hated the experience you got at EC, you can just shift then lol (shifting to RR-CSE is incredibly tough though) . Choose what you're interested in, don't make a decision purely because the reality didn't match your expectations :)",
    "Bruh what's so bad?",
    "If you aren't passionate about cse, take ece rr.

    "Yes i suggest you should drop pes, even rr campus, the bald guy won't tell you this but I will, maramma institute of technology is better, they teach you everything about cloud in the cloud and about artificial intelligence all from the basics of artificial colouring and preservatives, maramma institute of technology has 100% in campus placement as a security guard, something pes can't provide for you, also the crowd is perfect, there is no crowd, u can sleep all day and still get placed and be the topper of the University, how cool is that? \nIt's not a jail as well like someone else was mention about EC , maramma institute of technology has open sky classrooms since the roof is unfinished and they teach you about weather forecasting and prediction models real time using windows XP running chat gpt on internet explorer, i strongly suggest maramama institute of technology to be the one for you\n└── bro got offended 🥀, I'm sorry if it hurt your sentiments but I come from a very strong festing and munning background and i really felt like i would be hampered of a lot of joys this has brought to me. again I'm apologetic for my tone.\n    └── \"munning\" there's no such word called munning, pata nahi with that vocabulary kya mun karta hai tu, par theek hai, this is not bihar that you can conduct your \"mun\" in every galli about what ghutka stains can be used to colour walls, usko mun nahi kehte\n\n\n\"Festing\" both campus have only 1 fest, koi special nahi hai tu, and both campus can visit each other's fest\n\nYou visit the campus when everyone is on their holidays and say \"bad crowd\" then bring up \"munning\" out of nowhere \n\n\nAlso if you are seriously into extra curriculars more than studies i suggest u don't join either of the campus, pes is not for you, u will barely have time after the assignments extra classes and back to back tests isas etc. student of the year movie nahi hai college life\n        └── yo wait if you are from ecc do you mind if I dm you??\n            └── Was* , and ok"
