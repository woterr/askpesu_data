    "I took IoT in my 5th sem. It's easy theory stuff with less syllabus. The slides are newly made by PESU IoT and it covered all the required stuff for ISAs and ESA. It's an easy A/S grade if you can remember some theory well.\n\nFaculty for it in ECC is Vinodha ma'am. You wouldn't need a lot of help from teacher for this subject tho.\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Thank you so much, this was so helpful!\n    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ No problem üëç"
