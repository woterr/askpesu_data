  "title": "[Admission] Photograph Upload problem in PESU App",
  "content": "For the new students through JEE Quota , the form wasn't visible on the website so people said go in PESU app and click \"Student Grievance\" to gain access to the form.. which I did .. but thanks to the excellent app it didn't let me upload my passport photo itself .. so I had to submit form without it. Now they said my application is incomplete because of no photo, and I can't access the form back by same method. Is anybody going through the same here and have found a solution to it ? ",

    "I just changed my profile picture on the app to the passport size photo and emailed the support, they said it's been updated\n├── I did that the same day but still today I got a \"photo reminder\". Maybe it is taking time for them to respond to my email\n└── How to change the profile picture bro please tell"
