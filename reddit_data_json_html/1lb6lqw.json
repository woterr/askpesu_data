  "content": "So i'll be most likely joining PES CSE (EC campus) this year. I have a lot of interest in cybersecurity and i know that theres no specialization course offered at PESU. But i saw something like Information Security and forensics during the ppt played during counselling. Is it the same or its completely different? \n\nAdditional ques : 1)are tabs allowed inside the class because i'll be most likely making notes on it and are the professors chill with it?\n\n2) How is sports at the campus as i love to play football in the evening. Will i get time to for extracurriculars as I know PESU is academically rigorous",

    "PES does have a security related specialisation as part of core CS. Look into the electives it offers (scroll this sub or ask an incoming 3rd year on the sub/discord). You're probably referring to the ISFCR research lab. I wasn't a part of this, so someone with experience can talk about it. \n\n1. Depends on the prof. In first year, it mostly won't be permitted.\n2. Depends on you and your time management skills.\n├── Thank you very much for the info\n└── Can we take notes on laptop or notebooks a re needed?",
    "I'm from aiml but can confirm that there is a specialization called cyber security and connected systems offered to both cse and aiml\n└── Pls check dm"
