    "My org prefers hiring people in technical clubs, especially HSP and ACM.\n\nAlso,  it exposes you too a solid alumni network, and helps you socialize. \n\nHelping run events also helps you make contacts with your juniors. \n\nYes, there will be politics, but you can ignore most of the drama as long as you are not in the core.\n├── So how should I join the club. I am more interested in Hsp but I don't know how to join\n│   └── registrations are closed :(\n│       └── Yeah sad\n└── does clubs effect placements , internship offers and higher studies \n\nso is it like companies who come for hiring prefer students who have been in a technical club rather than one who has not\n    └── My stint in the various clubs has given me a great network of people (something very important in our field), and also some fairly good company which will spur you to learn more!\n\nSo, there is a correlation between being in the marquee clubs (esp. in the technical domains) and having better outcomes. \n\nMy org, (and my manager) prefer such people, because they have a demonstrated interest in what they do, and are not just doing it for the money.",
    "Registrations for most clubs has ended afaik. U could go and ask in the WhatsApp grp which ones open tho.\n└── 1 is open till 23 so I an considering that club\n    └── waw fr? which one?\n        └── Aicodingclub"
