  "content": "**Hello** r/PESU **‚Äì newcomers, seniors, and my fellow batchmates,**\n\nI come to you today with a story.\n\nA story from a long, long time ago, yet one so scarring that I remember every detail as if it happened yesterday.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt was a cold June morning when I got a DM on Discord from my homie:  \n**\"Results are out.\"**\n\nThat night, I opened the provisional results on pesuacademy. And like most others on results day, I was deeply disappointed.\n\nEven in subjects I had studied for *years*, I received poor grades.  \nI discussed it with my friends, and immediately, something felt off.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUsually, for *most* subjects in *most* semesters, the grade curve is skewed toward an A, with maybe a couple hundred students scoring S grades.But this time, Things were different.\n\nIn one subject, the curve skewed toward a B, and only six people scored an S.\n\nSurely, this couldn‚Äôt be right.\n\nEven the smartest people I know, folks who always ace everything, got poor grades. They all advised me to go for ESA reviews.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo I opened my wallet.  \nA fly flew out.\n\nBut I coughed up the currency from my already-dwindling resources, and went ahead with the reviews.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Review Day.**  \nMy jaw dropped.\n\nThe answers were *wrong.*  \nAnd not just one or two, I found five or six that were clearly incorrect.\n\nAnd I don‚Äôt say this out of ego. I fully understand the irony of an undergrad calling out a team of PhD professors, but some of these mistakes were *inexcusable*.\n\nI remember one clearly: it was a Dijkstra algorithm question.  \nTheir answer was 14.\n\nBut I, being a human with working eyes, traced out a path of **13**.  \nI went home, re-solved the problem, still got 13.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMind you, this wasn‚Äôt some advanced AI algorithm.  \nIn CS, a basic graph problem with 10 nodes isn‚Äôt rocket science.  \nIt‚Äôs like solving a maze from the back of a Classmate notebook, even a kid could do it.\n\nAnd that was just *one* question.  \nThere were many more like it.\n\nYou can imagine my shock when I realized:  \nA team of \\~20 PhD professors couldn't correctly solve an undergrad-level paper that **they themselves set**.\n\nThey really will give *anyone* a degree these days, wont they?\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThey say incompetence has no emotion.  \nBut among the PESU faculty, even *shame* seems to be in short supply.\n\nStill, I did the obvious thing, I forked up *even more* of ***my money*** to send my paper for re-evaluation.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTwo weeks passed. No update.\n\nI eventually found, from a friend, that the fuckass mobile app shows outdated data unless you update it via Play Store.  \nApparently, these PhD *computer science* professors can‚Äôt implement a backwards-compatible API.\n\nAnd guess what?  \nNo change in my grade.\n\nOut of 30 people I asked, **not a single** grade had changed.\n\nIt really did feel like Jawahar just **stole my money**.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \nI tried talking to professors.\n\nAll I got was:\n\n&gt;‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt do anything about it.‚Äù\n\nAnd that‚Äôs when it hit me.  \nI am but a speck of dust in this tsunami of destruction through indifference.  \nI cannot stop it, and I cannot change it.  \nI cannot save my juniors from it.  \nAll I can do is warn the newcomers:\n\n&gt;The institution does **not** care about you, or fairness, for that matter\n\n**To the Reddit mods considering removing this post**:  \nI'm not criticizing the college or its processes maliciously.  \nI *fully understand* how hard it is to correct 1000+ papers with zero mistakes.\n\nAll I'm saying is, you, the reader, and probably my junior, need to understand this:  \nThese numbers? They‚Äôre **somewhat arbitrary**.\n\nOf course, Try your best to maintain a good GPA. But if you can‚Äôt,  \n**Don‚Äôt punish yourself.**\n\nThis system fails even the smartest people.  \nAnd often, your failure might not even be your fault.\n\n**I love you.**  \nTake care. üíô",
