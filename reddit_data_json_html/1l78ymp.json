    "It takes roughly 2 weeks and you need to check the same old results page to see if there are any changes. Will your grade change or not, now that's something I cannot comment on, nobody knows really. All we can do is hope and pray.\n└── Backlog results also reflect in old results ? Or there will seperate results for it ?\n    └── This I don't know"
