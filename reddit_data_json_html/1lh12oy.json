    "If you have a backlog , you Have to clear it Before 6th sem /3rd year end , You have 4 attempts to clear it.  \nIf you clear it , your gpa will be adjusted according to your new grade and the semester you clear the backlog , you will see the new grade along with that semster's subjects.  \nResume is built by you, So you dont have to show that u have a backlog if you have. But while sitting during placements , mention u have a backlog if you do. Some companies wont let u sit if you have backlog. \n\nPlacemnets start 7th sem , so ideally when your 6th sem results come , make sure you have no backlogs by then.\n\nAll the best\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Silly question but what happens if you fail in the 4th attempt as well?\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Your computer has virus sir.\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Afaik , there was unlimited attempts when i studied in pesu. 4 attempts criteria is introduced just recently. i think they mostly will allow you to write again lol. anyway extra bucks for them for another attempt.\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ Does it show anywhere? Like on the app or website that this subject had backlog\nâ”‚           â””â”€â”€ in app and website yes, once you clear it . it will show the new grade\nâ”‚               â””â”€â”€ Like when I sit for placement of degree or report card will it show backlog\nâ”‚                   â””â”€â”€ If you clear it , it wont show in your degree , it wont affect your placements. your report card/ grade card will have the backlog in the semester you have backlog, the semester you clear it , you will get a new grade at the end of that semester's grade card.\nâ””â”€â”€ if you get a backlog does it mean you're barred from all scholarships for the rest of your time at the college?\n    â””â”€â”€ no u can still perform well in the next sem and get one scholarship , although getting the highest scholarship would be unlikely."
