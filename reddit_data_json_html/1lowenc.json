  "content": "Same as the title. I'm super into robotics and everything but I pretty much have 0 knowledge. I know a little bit of designing and I have what you would call \"surface level knowledge\" on ROS Humble. I've done a little bit of modelling too.\nIf someone could give me like a checklist or roadmap of sorts, on what kind of projects/work I should have prepared and what I should learn, before applying to the club the next semester. \nFor context I've just finished my first semester and I have a little over a month of vacation. \n \nP.S: I have also registered for a skill enhancement course this summer. It's a week long course titled \"Python Bootcamp\" or smtg.\nI also know a little bit of matlab (apart from college syllabus ofc).",

    "Your resume looks strong enough, alter it to show that ure interested in robotics, other than that, show a lot of passion that ure willing to work on their projects and allocate a lot of time on it. I'm a technical member of the club and we usually look for people who r willing to learn, not people who know a lot.\n├── How to get into this club from 3rd sem ?\n└── Can I dm you?",
    "Keep an eye out for their recruitments by following instagram page. You already seem to be on an alright path. There's no set roadmap (research on what all you can do at your capabilities and resources, lots of subreddits, forums, books, etc. there), and the willingness to work and learn is more important."
