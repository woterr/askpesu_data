    "Idk if there is any change currently but according to last year counselling except 10k the rest of the amount will be refunded",
    "Go for both attempts no harm in that if u get any seat in first round take it if by the time of second round u don't get the desired seat in different college attend the second round by this time most of the people give up hope and seats will be free and there is no additional fees only 10 k gets cut",
    "Getting a cse seat in the 2nd round is nearly impossible as not that many students give up their seats...but then since it's only jee and kcet scores now...myt be diff \nAnd if u do take ur seat back, all ur fees will be returned except for 10k.",
