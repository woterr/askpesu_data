  "content": "Hi PES friends, I am an alumnus from PESIT. We have recently launched an app to help people find company for meals. We all recognize that we have a loneliness epidemic. Especially once you graduate and start working. It's hard to meet people, especially the people with like mindedness. This causes many of us to be in situations where we eat alone although we don't like to. We want to try new restaurants and new cuisines but can't find company who has same eating preferences. \n\nSo we made Solono app. Solono helps you add meal requests and let others repond to it. You can choose to match with someone from interested people and have a meal with them while having good conversations. \n\nWe really hope this brings us a bit closer leading to new friendships, professional networks and even relationships. Hope you all download and enjoy the app. \n\nDownload link on the website. [www.solonoapp.com](http://www.solonoapp.com) ",
