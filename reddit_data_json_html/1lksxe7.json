    "Trash\nFirst decide if u want cse or ece\nThen take decision on college.\nBranch is wayy more important than college.\nAlso ecc cse is basically the same as rr cse so I would suggest u put it above msrit cse\nIk cse cutoffs are low for ecc in kcet for some reason but I don't understand this heard mentality.",
    "Ec campus so low whyyyyy\nâ””â”€â”€ Forgot about it so I wrote it last it would be below bmsce\n    â”œâ”€â”€ Ec cse is same as rr cse\n    â””â”€â”€ But aren't both rr and ec almost the same?",
    "Regardless of your interest in specializations, always put core CSE above all other specializations. There is nothing special about these specializations they merely exist to increase intake into CS. Especially here in PES, the syllabus between cs and aiml vaires only for the electives offered in 5th and 6th sem. Core CS always has access to electives related to AIML but AIML doesnt have access to all core CS electives. So be wise and put core CS above all.",
    "SIT Tumkur is the best. Pes is just IIT BLR SIT is IIT Karnataka ðŸ¥°\nâ””â”€â”€ Nah, lol. SIT has horrible coding culture and trash peer group  \nhonestly, tumkur feels dead",
    "Keep BMSCE at 2. Push RVCE to 4 assuming that you prefer CSE. Rest is perfect."
