    "Not sure why you aren't believing the comments which day that you're going to have a hard time. If all you want is validation, you shouldn't have asked a question. \n\nHere's the harsh truth - your GPA is low. It barely meets the eligibility criteria to sit for placements. You're not really in an advantageous position here. Most companies will filter you out at some stage or the other. If you aren't filtered out to write the test, they'll filter you while shortlisting for interviews. And about the examples you quote - they're exceptions, a handful among the hundreds with a low CGPA who are struggling to land a single offer. Remember that there are kids with a 9+ GPA struggling in the current market. \n\nThe question is, are you in those exceptions you quote about, or are you in that handful? Only you can answer that. Not saying you don't have a shot - but you're going to have a very uphill struggle. There's no point living in your daydream that you're going to have it all easy. The sooner you wake up and realise that instead of countering facts, the better for you. Good luck.",
    "Not massively cooked since youâ€™re a female but please get it above 7 asap at any cost.\nâ””â”€â”€ Ya i just want to be placed even if T3\n    â””â”€â”€ It can happen. I had 6.5 and I currently have a 1L internship (hoping it converts)ðŸ¤ž\n        â””â”€â”€ Thankyou so much this came in a moment i needed the most how much DSA did you do ? Iâ€™ve currently done till greedy\n            â””â”€â”€ Please donâ€™t let my comment make you complacent and distract you from the fact that anything below 7 is dangerous. I still consider my selection a miracle. \nAs for DSA, frankly I didnâ€™t have to do much as i had exceptional co curriculars that helped me get a product-tech role.",
