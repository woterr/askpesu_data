    "Nope, no respite for u this time with numericals, only 3-4 max\n└── 😭",
    "50% - Important theory topics  \n20% - Numericals from important topics like scheduling  \n30% - Miscellaneous and not so intuitive to answer type questions\n└── are the misc ques hard??\n    └── By miscellaneous, I mean the random topics that are there which you won't really expect to come in ESA as a 6-7M. Like I remember a question on UFS/NFS (idr exactly) came to draw the diagram of it and explain. In the slides there was only a diagram at 240p for it and no explanation for it given anywhere lmao. But they did ask that.\n\nOn top of it, we had only 1 day gap to prepare for OS ESA💀 Everybody got cooked badly\n        ├── did they ask any coding, like for message sharing and file system system calls?\n        │   └── Yeah there were 2-3 questions coding related. Those are part of the 30% miscellaneous questions.\n        └── Are the slides enough or would we need to read the tb as well\n            └── I mean you can't read the tb at this point of time💀. Just do the slides properly.",
    "Glance through Aronya(🙏🏼) notes\n\nNumericals will be asked for sure, LRU Paging/ another paging. Scheduling based questions for sure\n\nCoding is kinda unpredictable, make sure to cover up buffers code and semaphores and deadlock handling",
    "I am telling you guys just go through everything and they could ask anything from any corner no important questions bullshit and also be thorough with your numericals they will be there , and it is going to be tough get through it 5 and 6 sem chill life\n└── &gt;5 and 6 sem chill life\n\nUmm i actually heard that it's the other way?\n    └── Yeah I assumed the opposite since we'd have capstone and internship tests...\n        └── Subjects are more manageable if u take electives wisely nothing  else chill Abt it though\n            └── Is it overall worse than 2nd year?\n                ├── Nope the subject complexity is lower than 2nd year apart from cd in 6th sem but workload is higher due to capstone , dsa etc\n                └── Workload is definitely higher (capstone + placement prep + internship). Toughness depends on what kind of electives you take up. Only 1-3 of the core courses in 3rd year are challenging, they're more straightforward (but still vast)",
    "Wouldn’t be surprised if they ask numericals on topics we couldn’t have even imagined had numericals\n└── My biggest fear is that they’ll not ask numericals and suddenly start asking theory for 8 marks 😭"
