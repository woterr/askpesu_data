  "content": "Does anyone has any email id or any contact no. Of one of the higher authorities in The college? I have sent the documents through courier, the last date of surrender is 7th July and 9th July is the 1st Iteration Of Bits, there is a small chance i might get msc so any help in extension of seat surrendering date would be helpful, i was reading they charge 2k per day if crossed the surrender date please if any senior or anyone can help me regarding this that would be really appreciated. Mailing admission authority wouldn’t be so beneficial since they just have basic knowledge i have to get to higher authorities and i can’t visit college rn i am in delhi so please it’s important i don’t wanna lose on pes incase things goes sideways in bits please seniors",
