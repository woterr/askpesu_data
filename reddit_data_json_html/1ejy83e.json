    "It's not difficult but the teacher will make it. Read the text books from the start of the semester and it'll be the most interesting year ever\n└── what textbooks?\n    └── The recommended textbooks. At the start of the semester, you get a document titled 'course plan' or something along those lines. It tells you which section of the course is taken from which section in what textbook. Some courses have one textbook, some have multiple. You'll find free pdfs online for these textbooks or if you prefer, you can get a hard copy from the library\n        ├── Adding to this: Not sure if it still happens but the campus mart used to sell photocopies of these books at cheap rates and at the end of the semester they used to buy back these copies. Many students who preferred a hard copy but did not want to invest in the book used to opt for these.\n        ├── oh kk makes sense\n        └── Can we borrow it from library for a few weeks and take it home?\n            └── Yeah u can and u can renew it too as many times u want"
