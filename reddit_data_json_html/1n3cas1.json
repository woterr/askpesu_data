    "Wait you guys got mail???\nâ””â”€â”€ Only CSE people got it seems \n\nThat's so fucking unfair man. Fuck pes if this is true\n    â”œâ”€â”€ You do realise it's company that sets the rules and the placement cell follows it\n    â””â”€â”€ No bro it's for circut branches. I got the mail. I am ece\n        â””â”€â”€ yeah my bad I asked around and some people just did not get it even some cse/ai people did not get it seems\n            â””â”€â”€ Yeah bro in middle some company mail till today I not got those",
    "Is this bait or they actually sent mail?",
    "Imagine bro like ibm fails to be the life saver\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Have a bad feeling\nâ””â”€â”€ Hopefully they take atleast 50",
    "Any seniors with less than 8gpa who got placed in ibm?",
    "when did you get the mail",
    "Are the online assessments common for all roles or role-specific? I mainly code in Java, but noticed some JDs mention C/C++/Python, so I was wondering if itâ€™s still fine to apply with Java as my strength. \n(With respect to IBM)\nâ””â”€â”€ Same doubt here,nearly 6 of them had c/c++\n    â””â”€â”€ True, but I think as long as weâ€™re strong in problem solving and passing all the test cases, the language shouldnâ€™t matter much. Still, maybe worth checking with seniors who sat for IBM last year?"
