    "I'm going to say what I know about mechanical boostrap since I helped conducting it past 2 years. Don't need to carry anything. it'll take place in the parking lot. First you'll be shown some informational videos (boring, just to extend time). Next there are cars and bikes which is kept and some seniors will explain about the vehicles internals and running and give you guys the opportunity to do some basic work on them. This activity is honestly fun and a change of pace, so I suggest you attend it. Idk if the boostrap is the exact same this year as well tho but should be similar\nâ””â”€â”€ Is it different for other branches or same for all?",
