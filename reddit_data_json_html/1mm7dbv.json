    "ML can be a little tricky, read from slides, some YouTube videos if it’s confusing etc. overall it’s manageable, but may not be the highest scoring.\nSE is just memorising, if you have bad memory start early lol. The questions in the ISA are pretty straightforward.\nDBMS is by far the easiest, slides are your bible. \nIf you have a good teacher(Mahitha,Nagasundari) listen in class, that’s half your prep done.\n└── Thanks a lot !!"
