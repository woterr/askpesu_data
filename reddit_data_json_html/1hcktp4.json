    "I really do hope we have relative grading. My isa 2 marks are really bad\n└── Exactly, apparently aiml and ece might not have cuz our  branch strength is only 380 something\n    ├── It depends on the course and how the batch performs in it. Relative grading is applied on a per-course basis.\n    │   └── As long as it depends on the marks its fine, cuz pretty much no one got above 33 in isa\n    │       └── It depends on the overall score that's obtained. Can't predict with just ISA marks. Plus, PES isn't transparent about these things either.\n    │           └── Yeah, only if they could display everything properly\n    └── I don't think it is dependent on the strength of the batch\n        └── I dont know. A senior told that their ece didnt have relative grading cuz of strength\n            └── Oh but isn't that very stupid? Doesn't average matter the most? But then again we can never know.\n                └── If the highest total score in the entire batch is below 95/100 (including both ISAs and ESA) there’s likely to be some form of relative grading—at least, that’s what the chancellor guy said. However, they’re highly unpredictable, so just be prepared for anything.\n                    └── Ohh I am honestly not expecting much from them. But if what the chancellor said is true then we'll get relative grading unless someone ends up scoring 100/100 in the esa, because barely any people got 35 plus in both the isas",
    "Bruh when are CSE results coming? I just wanna get it over with lol\n└── i have a feeling that these fools will release results 12 hours before webtech exam to mess with us.\n    └── Yeah totally can happen lol  \nour WT teacher told me they have all finished correcting 2 days before itself"
