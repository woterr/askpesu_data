  "content": "I don't have a backup so hear me out carefully i'm gonna explain the timeline\n\nAround April 20th: We visited to college and they said apply for pessat there's no direct admission but I asked if I failed the pessat interview what can I do she said \"come back to me ill sort it out\" (im guessing management seat)\n\nMay 13th: I gave my interview but I had technical issues like the interviewer couldn't hear me and my camera and mic kept getting stuck she asked me a few questions then gave up and told me to leave \n\nMay 15th: Got message that I was rejected I emailed the admission office for a second interview after telling about my situation they said nothing can be done and they can't give a second interview\n\nMay 18th?: Then my friend said just filled the form again and I filled it halfway and left it just before the payment but I left it half filled with the original number I gave for my first interview\n\nMay 20th: I randomly got a call from college to finish filling the registrations and then when they heard my voice they recognized me and asked didn't I book the slot for 13th then she asked did I attend that interview I said no by mistake I wasnt thinking clearly then she said ok fine just finish the registration and fill the form and do the interview again\n I filled a brand new form with a new number and email just in case so i'll count as a new applicant \n\nMay 21st : I booked the slot again for june 3rd \n\nMy doubts are: \n1) Should I go directly to college and ask them to \"sort it out\"\n2) But won't they find out I filled the slot again and refuse to take my interview or smth or not give me a seat in general (even management?)\n3) Should I wait for the confirmation call from the new number (they normally call you after booking a slot) but this might take a few days should I wait or go now itself? will this cause any issues?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
