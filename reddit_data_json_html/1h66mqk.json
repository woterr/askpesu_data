    "They donâ€™t come for placements to our college. Microsoft used to at some point but they stopped several years back.",
    "not a faang but microsoft came this year\nâ””â”€â”€ i think amazon also came? i was seeing the 2025 data and i see both microsoft and amazon has hired pesu students",
    "Check out LinkedIn, you will find plenty of PES alumni currently working at Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Google. I personally know many from my own circle who are working at these companies, all after graduating college. The placement sheet might not be fully updated - LinkedIn would be more accurate.\nâ””â”€â”€ but how many of those were college placements and how many were off campus?\n    â””â”€â”€ Everyone working full time at Apple and Amazon have been through placements. People at Google were not exactly from placements, but rather a college program by Google (I've forgotten the name now) that later shortlisted people. Only MS did not visit.",
    "Only Apple came for our batch :)",
    "Microsoft stopped on campus / off campus hiring altogether, except for IITs and a few other colleges. They mainly hire through the Microsoft engage program, which is a project + 2 month internship program. They use to come for that earlier when I was a student.\n-Source: I work at Microsoft"
