    "If placements are your priority and you do not care much about college life then PES is literally your calling lmao\n├── Ok thank you 👍\n└── hi sry to hijack comments but im very confused rn.  \ni got 13xx and everybody is saying dont waste rank in pes, go for bms,   \nim only looking for decent/not too shit placements and nice college life  \nif u know any bms seniors can u pls link them to me  \nsorry again\n    ├── You can look up current BMSCE students as well as alumni on LinkedIn. Or post on their subreddit.\n    │   └── linkedin might work, the subreddit nobody really replies , anyway thanks!\n    │       └── Bro same I'm in exact 💯 same situation rn😭. I have got ECE in  PES RR through Pessat. I'll get ECE or AIML in BMS through Comedk. Everybody in my family wants me to go for PES. But I have a strong gut feeling that I'll face hell there. My school life was strict af.......and my mental health is fucked up. I don't want to relive it again. Also that doesn't mean I can compromise on placements. Bms is itself and amazing college with a better homely environment and good placements. That's all I want😭. After paying a visit to both PES and BMS I'm more convinced. A senior from PES was like everything is good here blah blah\n........but I'm never looking back at it again.......\n\n\nIdk bro just tell me what you'll choose \n    └── Pes placements are way better than bms so they're prolly trying to reduce the cutoffs lol",
    "Most of the companies do visit both the colleges, competition is pretty high in PES with the massive batch strength, it’s a double edged sword ( can motivate you to work harder or can find it hard to compete). If you are ready to work your ass off be in the top 20 percentile then only join PES or else go for BMS\n├── Ok thank you 👍\n└── BMS CSE intake very high, check latest #",
    "pes if academics are ur priority if college life then bms\n└── Bro what is college life plis explain how pes is lacking in that department\n    └── its damn strict bro, the clubs are not that great, sports are non existent for people who want to casually play.\n        └── Bro ur kidding abt sports part right? \nWhich campus is this I want atleast casual badminton and I'm not some state player or some shit.\n\nAnd strict as in? Some examples from ur experience u give plis\n            ├── even i am fresher bro, just talking from what i have heard.\n            └── for example although EC campus has a full sized cricket ground, only the team uses it and i heard even they barely play.   \nIt seems the football ground can be used tho\n                └── Yeah this is what I was talking abt. Casual players can't play in the ground or what?\n                    └── idk bro, but cricket tho i am damn sure only team is allowed, ig its so that the pitch doesn't get spoiled.",
    "PES Main Campus or EC Campus dude?\n├── Main campus\n│   └── Placements-wise, it's a no-brainer dude, and the fact that you're getting them both through KCET makes it an even easier decision to make. PES on top :)))\n│       ├── Ok thanks a lot 👍🫡\n│       └── Is pes placements really that better than bmsce when you take into consideration only cse?\n├── is there much difference between both?\n│   └── nah bro, main thing is placements are same for both, teaching doesnt matter as both are bad\n│       └── How are you sure about the bms placements cus they don't release them but according to a rti filed in 2021 , the cs placements was around 10 11 lpa.\n│           └── i was replying to the question abt difference between Both the campus of PES.\n└── how is it diff from EC campus i got in thru pessat and prolly gonna take cs there tf is it something bad or sumn"
