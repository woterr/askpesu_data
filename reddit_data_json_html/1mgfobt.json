    "I was stuck in a terrible PG on this very street—horrible food, worse vibes. Lasted 3 months before I had enough and moved to a flat.\n└── oh! btw, do you know if there are any flats available for rent near the college? also, any good cook contacts you’d recommend? would be super helpful\n    └── Check dm"
