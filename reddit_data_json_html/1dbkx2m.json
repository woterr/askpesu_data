Idk what happened but I got confused during fee payment and paid 23k which was mentioned above . Because of that I am excluded from claiming scholarship. I would receive nearly 50k a year. Currently I am 1st year . What should I do. The vc was like u didn't had confidence in you and after getting good grade you paid extra 10k",

    "Nothing can be done, pay that 10k extra from 2nd year onwards.\n\nFor kcet students, scholarship is a gamble.. \n\nAlso just to let you know I havent received 3rd sem scholarship yet.. And I am in 5th sem now\n├── which department?\n│   └── ECE\n└── Help me understand this. If I join PES through PESSAT (already have a seat, hoping to get a seat someplace better), will I have any issues with scholarship? I'm banking on the fact that I wouldn't have to pay atleast 40% of the fees.\n    └── No..you guys have royal treatment XD\n        └── True af",
