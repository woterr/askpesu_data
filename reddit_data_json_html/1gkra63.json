    "When I was in first year they didn't flag folks below 60 ,I personally had 65-68 in first sem and didn't have to give even a medical record.\n\nAlso it depends a lot on department, what I've seen is CSE is chill regarding attendance whereas ECE ,EEE Mech are worst\nâ””â”€â”€ ohhh, im in my second year now (cse) I had to sign an affidavit in my first sem for having 69ish ðŸ˜­\n    â””â”€â”€ You just got the forbidden number",
    "Anything above 70, go to your teacher and ask them, they'll mostly give",
    "It depends on how strict said teacher is. No idea how they mark attendance. If the teacher is lenient they might ask you to do something to make up...but if its strict just do what they say, like attend remaining classes to make up.",
    "try to get it above 75\ntheyâ€™re hella stingy with it"
