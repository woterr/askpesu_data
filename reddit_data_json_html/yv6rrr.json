I am currently in my Third Semester of ECE. it has been tough to cover up due to multiple projects, Assignments, quizzes, etc., \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow to improve upon the grades, at least In ISA-5 and ESA?  \n\n\n*P.S: Generally I prefer to complete one or more of the following for any exam -* \n\n*a.  Study from the textbook, make my own notes, and simultaneously try to comprehend stuff from it as well.*\n\n*b.  Do the assignments and QB from PESU academy.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt would be great if someone suggests me some measures on how to improve my scores In ISAs &amp; ESA.",
