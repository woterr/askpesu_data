  "content": "\nI’ve had a rough start with a GPA of 6.54 in my first two semesters. I’ve improved since then, getting 8.5 in 3rd sem and 8.9 in 4th sem. But even if I keep doing well, my overall GPA won’t reach 8.5.\n\nIs there anything I can do to make up for this — like projects, internships, or certifications? I want to know if I still have a shot at good placements ",
