  "content": "I thought PES was a good university till I read this subreddit. I am really shocked reading so many negative reviews. Should I even consider joining it? I scored 92.43 percentile in jee jan attempt. I scored worse in april attempt due to health issues. I belong to general category so I am not sure if I will qualify for advance. I am writing comedk,viteee,aeee,ugee,bitsat along with pessat. Are vit and amrita better than PES? I heard that vit is a scam and the college life is terrible so I am not hopeful about that too. Atp I feel like I don't have much options. Is the high fees worth it? Will I get a good placement in PES if I take CSE? Or should I take a drop and try jee,ugee and bitsat again next year? I am so lost. Any guidance would be appreciated.",

    "Pes is 100% better than joining vit/ Amrita. They aren't worth staying in hostel for. If you aren't getting any national institute, go for pes.",
    "So here's my opinion: don't finalise PES (or any college) until all your entrances are done. Focus on what's left and give your best and then decide. \n\nPES isn't worth it through PESSAT anymore. There are similar/better colleges which cost about the same. PES is good but it isn't anywhere close to the reputation it has outside. Only once you enter do you actually see the college for what it is. However, every college has its share of problems. The major advantages of PES are it's placements and syllabus, everything else is pretty average at best. So if you're looking to just get a job at the end of your degree and nothing else, this place will fulfill your requirements. \n\nTo summarise, PES isn't bad by any means but it definitely isn't the \"gates of heaven\" that some people think it is lmao. But it's definitely better than Amrita or VIT IMO.\n\nI've documented the rest of the pros and cons of PES in the FAQs: https://bit.ly/pesu-faq.\n└── Do u think the placements will improve? U said that cse 2024 placements weren't tht gud cuz of recession.\n    └── Ideally yes, it will take 2-3 years to get back to what it was.\n        └── Northie here........ for me is it worth.... 4.8 lpa just for  tution fees definitely quite high....... nothing getting in jee main\n            └── Not worth via PESSAT. Join only if you don't have any other comparable options at lower costs.",
    "[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/s/q3Lh5IVTtM) is a list of pros and cons of PESU by u/rowlet-owl\n└── Tho at that time the seats were less today the seats have significantly increased is that's connto\n    └── I keep the comment updated every 6 months or so. So it still applies. For example: earlier the cons included the 5 ISA system, that's been removed now.\n        └── What should I consider VIT SRM KIIT PES ?",
    "Reddit users are an extremely small section of people with some specific views. Do talk to people outside of reddit as well. \nAny education institution has good and bad things. Maybe only the bad things are getting more highlighted here. \nI have studied at PESIT long ago. I know quite a lot of students who have studied there over the years. Almost all of us have overwhelmingly good opinion about the quality of education there and the placement opportunities. \nMy personal recommendation would be to join PES, if you have an opportunity. \nAlso, do talk to students currently studying there, the alumni, etc (and not just rely on reddit here).\n├── This is true af\n└── ya ik every college has its pros and cons. Ik a couple of guys from ece they graduated 4 yrs ago and they have average jobs now but they said its a gud college. I am interested in taking cse so idk if the placements scenario will improve .I saw in this subreedit that 2024 cse placements weren't gud but thts bcz of recession. I won't make my decision soley based on reddit. I was just asking for insights. Idk how to reach out to students currently studying here so reddit was my only option.\n    └── The discord server opens up for new incoming students only after PESSAT. Once that's done you can freely interact with current students. For now, ask on this sub.\n        └── oh I don't have discord but I will make an account.

    "I just searched it up and the fee is like 4.8 lakhs isn't it way more compared to vit\n└── idk isn't it almost the same as vit? If I go to vit I have to pay hostel fees. I can go by metro to pes. I am more concerned about which college has better placements.\n    └── well i checked mfs are mentioning 4.8 lakhs for btech 💀\n        └── ya but for colleges like rv and bms it is like 10 lakhs and 7.5 lakhs per annum for cs specializations. Other colleges in my area aren't tht gud.\n            └── that's for management quota otherwise its not more than 3 lakhs anywhere\n                └── But the cutoff for general category is like 500 in kcet and comedk for cse.
