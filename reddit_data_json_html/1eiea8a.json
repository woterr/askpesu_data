    "lol ur friendships are weak af , im sorry but they r not ur friends\nâ””â”€â”€ Maybe ur right, somewhere there must have been my fault too in this, coz the people who had agreed to do capstone with me, now they dont want to do it, due to this i can see my friendships been affected ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥²",
    "This is my greatest fear. When it is time for me to make a capstone team, I can see my friends going with other people they know and I would be left alone ðŸ˜­\nâ””â”€â”€ Yes, even i feel the same ðŸ¥²ðŸ’€",
    "Prioritise common research goals/interests while choosing teammates and it will work out far better. Don't choose friends as capstone teammates unless they share the same goals. At the end of the day, you want not only yourself to do well but also your friends to do well in capstone. If it requires you to work in different teams, its something you will have to do.\nâ””â”€â”€ Okay, will follow the same, thank you",
    "Don't make teams with your friends, keep your work friends and friend friends separate."
