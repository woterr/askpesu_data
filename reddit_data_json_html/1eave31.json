    "Last year they took 22/32k. 22k if u don't want scholarship, extra 10k if u want to avail scholarship.                                    But keep in mind,once u pay extra 10k now, u have to pay that for next 3 years too.If u don't pay now, then u can never pay again and can't avail scholarship\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Oh ok thanks \nSo they pay for the scholarships of the top 5% with the money from the rest ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Yes..thatâ€™s how they have been scamming everyone one of us !\nâ””â”€â”€ Does this 22/32k fall under the \"miscellaneous fees mentioned by this [user](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/s/R3WALJqpE6)\n    â””â”€â”€ Yeah it does,u pay some of the misc fee through KEA now and remaining 22/32k directly to uni\n        â””â”€â”€ So 1.57 total and is it same for all  4 years?\n            â””â”€â”€ Idk how much ull be paying via KEA this year [this image](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/s/x8ILTG890w) has the fee structure of previous year.For us it was either 1.18/1.28( Through KEA - 96.5K, Directly to pes - 22/32k). Fee will be the same for 4 years\n                â””â”€â”€ Oh ok",
    "Wait what ?!! They have given that private/ deemed University can claim upto 20,000 rs per student as the other fees right, so how can they claim more than that ??"
