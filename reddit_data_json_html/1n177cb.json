  "content": "So I currently have a 3ish year old laptop, works fine for most tasks, its a 11th Gen i3, with 8gb ram. So i am in ECE 2nd year right now, i was wondering if i could push 2 more years with this laptop, because I will anyway get a better one after a get a job. I was planning to buy one last year, but decided to push as there was ntn much to do, was wondering if i could do the same? Because like till now, i have never used my laptop seriously, never needed a better laptop, except prolly during hackathon. Will it change in the coming days?",

    "Yes, you can manage 2 more years",
    "Bro nxt year u have to download vm box or linux for which u have to do partion on ur laptop , so it  might cause a lag and blue screen might appear, but some of my friend have same laptop it's good to buy new if u cash or else it ok\n└── Nah, I dont mind buying a new laptop, but then if it is worth it and needed i will buy, i just dont want to buy just coz. But the problem is idk if my memory is expandable in this laptop, can i push it with 8gigs? or just fak it and go for a new laptop?\n    └── Increase ur ram it will be fine",
    "I think you can upgrade your ram to 12 or 16 GB if it is expandable. I have the same specs and doing that made it a little bit faster.",
    "Yes you can , upgrade the ram to 16gb and boot/dual boot Linux (ubuntu or mint ) , the topper in my class used his decade old laptop for the entirety of the course"
