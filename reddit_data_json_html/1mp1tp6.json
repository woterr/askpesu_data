  "title": "[Question] Info regarding BCA at RR Campus",
  "content": "Hi all, asking a question on behalf of a relative wanting to admit his son here at RR Campus. Tried to look up online about any info I could find about the BCA department but couldn't find a lot beyond the Shiksha and Collegedunia AI generated aah stats.   \n  \nCould anyone from the department answer the following questions:  \n1. Is it still possible to get admission now?  \n2. What are classes like? As in the faculty, quality of teaching and the subjects.  \n3. I'm aware of PESU being a hectic college in general for BTech at least but is it the same for BCA?  \n4. What are the placements like? What is the gap in quality of placements b/w BTech and BCA?  \n5. Are there scholarships like the CNR and MRD scholarships in BTech?\n\nAny advice pertaining to the department would be appreciated as well. As they don't have a lot of good options atm they've decided to enroll him into PESU and dropping a year isn't really an option. Please help, thanks in advance.",

    "1) No \n2)You can say it's pretty decent\n3) Maybe\n4) BCA is relatively new, the current batch is the third batch of BCA and about the placement it won't come near to btech no matter what colleges you choose\n5) Yes\n└── Thanks!",
