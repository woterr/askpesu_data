    "Bring black pens, pencil (optional), transparent water bottle if you need and most importantly ID Card and Calculator!\n└── Along with the calculator, also make sure to know *how to use* it. So many used to turn up to our tests and struggle to find certain modes\n    └── oh yeah this happened to me for the avions club test, i got my first scientific calculator on that very day and i could not figure out how to get answers in decimal format instead of fractions 😭",
    "Don't forget to write only one question in a page , and bubble the question number on top of the page . Last year I did this mistake and lost marks\n└── Ik I'm very late but what about the subsequent pages of the same answer? I forgot to mark them, am i cooked? 😭🙏\n    └── The papers would have been checked till now , can't say anything",
