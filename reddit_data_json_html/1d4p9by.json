  "content": "Hi people of the internet, I haven't had a single backlog till date, but I am afraid I will end up with one in this sem. My internals as it stands is 23 out of 50 and the average is 33 out of 50. I'm not sure how much I have written in the ESA, it's likely that I'll get very little marks. In the event that I fail, what are my options as placement season is ahead of us. The lowest I've gotten is a D when I am sure I scored not more than 40 out of 100 in web technology. \nJust hoping I get an E and pass. Can I persue a project in ifscr while I have a backlog?",
