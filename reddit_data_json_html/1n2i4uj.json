  "content": "I‚Äôm in 5th sem ECE, and I‚Äôm more inclined towards preparing only for core ECE companies. I know that very few core companies come for placements, but I still want to focus on them. What I‚Äôm confused about is ‚Äî what exactly do they ask in their pre-placement tests? Like how CS students grind DSA and Leetcode, what are the domains and topics we need to prepare for our OAs? Any guidance would be really helpful because I‚Äôm honestly feeling quite lost and scared about what to study and where to study from.",

    "revise all core concepts and subjects mainly, that's the main thing, there wont be / very less coding in ECE core role OAs but MCQs and all very commonly asked. Learn about op-amps, and other core concepts, CMOS, VLSI etc., There is little reason to get scared, because core companies will come, its not 0, but just less than CSE based companies thats all.\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Plz it would be a great help üôè\nIam taking admission in PESU in EEE branch.U guys may know about EEE Faculty,i heard that the faculties are not so good,is it true?\nAnd I want to focus on core EEE and parallely on CS i want to do both things on next level,is it possible?\nIf not then what can I do in this situation.\n    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ I am not sure, sorry"
