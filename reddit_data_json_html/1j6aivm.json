    "Maaya has the same budget as a club event in RR campus ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­",
    "mostly ranges from 700-1100\nâ””â”€â”€ Can confirm,Also AT is far better than Maaya\n    â””â”€â”€ Yes it better be its like 10x the budget of maaya\n        â””â”€â”€ Not sure if youâ€™re aware of the lovely kalesh PES Management does but itâ€™s certainly not 10x,not even close.\nWe just sell more tickets,have better revenue streams and actually call an artist that people know.\n            â””â”€â”€ 1cr vs 7lakhs no shit you have better sales\n                â””â”€â”€ 1 crore brother?ðŸ’€ it isnâ€™t even 15-20% of that \nThe difference between the amount of money maaya gets from PES and AT gets from PES is less than the fees most people pay for a year\n                    â”œâ”€â”€ So you're telling me you guys got shaan for 20L ðŸ˜­.\n                    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ PES only gives a fraction of the money we use for fests.\n\nThe breakdown is as follows:\n\nPES given budget \nTicketing \nSponsorship \n\nThe difference in the total budget for either event is because AT sells more tickets,we receive more money from in-house events and our sponsorship turnout is better.\n                    â””â”€â”€ let's not kid ourselves lmfao, AT gets more than 5 times the budget from PES itself\n                        â””â”€â”€ I can give it to you in writing that it isnâ€™t that much,Iâ€™ve been connected to AT proceedings for the last two years trust me ðŸ’€\n                            â””â”€â”€ I've been a part of maaya for the past 2 years too lol, I've seen the way the management treats both the campuses. It's quite obvious AT gets a lot more money from the start"
