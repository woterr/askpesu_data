  "content": "I paid the seat blocking fees almost a month ago and this is what was written below but in another post about admission (not sure which course) the comments said within 3 days you need to upload your photo and documents to complete admission process otherwise you need to mail the admissions office to complete it for you but I didnt really have an option in the portal to do that it only said download your receipt and keep it\nSo now i'm confused do I need to upload my photos and documents or im all good?",
