    "why can't you call and confirm from their side regarding how you will get link and all after payment before hand.\n└── Have you paid fee?",
    "Why the flying fuck is this godforsaken college asking you to pay the entire year's fee before you even get a seat in the shit hole. It's honestly just an absolute embarassment\n\nA couple years later they'll probably ask for the entire 4 years' worth just to apply.\n\nRefund will take 5-10000 business days\n└── Exactly and even most of the councellings are still to happen I can't afford putting my 5 lakhs there so despite being interested to join pes and got a rank 13xx I didn't paid 5 lakhs and I'm not going to sit for R-1 of councelling maybe I will sit for round 2.",

    "Instead of spending all this time commenting “Have you paid 5,10,000” on the post, you could’ve just called the office and gotten the confirmation, duhh.",

    "Why do u think ull receive a bill on the same day? Like you said, you've sent at 2 pm and they close at 4 something. Just call them tmr instead of asking here cus ur not getting anything from reddit ",
