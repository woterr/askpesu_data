    "So are those who are joining through the 2nd round of CET counseling gonna miss orientation? Or would the 2nd round have been completed by then?\n├── ain't no way you're expecting kcet counselling to be over in 2 weeks 😭\n├── I think we'll get the results.\nCus last year, r2 result was 21 days after r1 result.\nSo we shd get it if the timeline is similar..\n├── Idts. Government counselling will obviously be late. But they'll probably create separate batches for you even if it doesn't end, so dw.\n│   └── Yeah they create separate batch for first year then from 2nd onwards it's mix\n└── pes wont wait for 2nd round . when 2nd round ppl join they ll have extra classes for 1 month or more (depending on how much kea delays).",
