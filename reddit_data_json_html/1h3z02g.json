    "This was posted last week or so. Please search the sub for a more detailed answer. For now, here's the summary:\n\n1. DDCO - understand the concepts thoroughly. If you don't understand them well, you're doomed for the ESA. You won't be able to answer conceptual questions by blinding memorising, the textbook is the best resource to understand concepts since it explains them in a lot of detail (learn to read a book, iPad kids) and also solve all the problems in the book. DDCO textbook is always a source for ESA questions. \n\n2. DSA - practice, practice and practice. Build logic and aptitude, practice questions online and be thorough with the basics. All problems build on the fundamentals, so make sure you are clear with them. Don't memorise, it won't get you far and will also hurt you later in courses that build on DSA. \n\n3. WT - pray to your favourite god(s). Jokes aside, check the past answers. I don't remember what people do to pass WT nowadays.\n└── Checking PYQPs for WT is helpful because even tho they dont really re-use questions (to the same degree as the other subjects do), its helpful to find roughly what typa questions will come\n\noverall though, try going thru and understanding ur miniproject code, or go thru react/mongo/express documentation"
