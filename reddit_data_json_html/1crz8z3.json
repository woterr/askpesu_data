  "title": "Speaking Out: Addressing the Recent Campus Incident",
  "content": "It is with a heavy heart and deep concern that we address the recent tragic incident that occurred on our campus. As members of this community, it is imperative that we come together to acknowledge and address the gravity of the situation.\n\nThe recent loss of a 3rd-year student who tragically committed suicide today on campus, amidst swirling rumors and speculation regarding the circumstances leading to his actions, is not just a matter to be swept under the rug. This marks the fourth suicide case within less than a year, and the third within our campus alone. Each time, the reasons may vary, but the common denominator remains: a lack of proper support and accountability within our institution.\n\nWhat is most distressing is the manner in which this incident was handled – or rather mishandled. Despite the undeniable impact it had on our students, especially those who witnessed it, classes continued as usual, with no acknowledgment or support offered to those affected. The insensitivity displayed towards the traumatized students is simply unacceptable.\n\nIt is time for our college administration to step up and take responsibility for the well-being of its students. Suppressing the media and hiding behind silence will not make the issue disappear. We demand transparency, accountability, and most importantly, action.\n\nWe call upon the administration to:\n\n1. Conduct a thorough investigation into the circumstances leading to this tragedy, with full transparency and involvement of students and faculty.\n2. Provide immediate and ongoing mental health support and counseling services for all students affected by this incident.\n3. Implement proactive measures to address academic pressures and create a supportive environment that prioritizes student well-being.\n4. Establish clear protocols for handling such incidents in the future, including timely communication and appropriate support for students and staff.\n\nWe cannot afford to let this tragedy fade into the background like those before it. We, students, deserve better, and it is our collective responsibility to ensure that our voices are heard and our needs are met.\n\nLet us stand together as a community to demand change and create a safer, more supportive environment for all.",

    "They have a counselling thing but the first thing i heard from my \"consellelor\" is you wont get a job . My GPA isnt even low per say . it was 7.4 when she told that\n├── Your councellor probably never worked in a real corporate job role outside University, i mean where the hell these people get these referance points like \"you won't get a job\".  \n\nWorking in a educational institution is completely different from working in a other industries. I am telling this with experience.\n├── nah..bro..u will get definitely a job but it depends on the branch...which branch r u in ? also...luck and knowledge and preparation for placement  exam matters.\n│   └── Unfortunately computer science. Idk about luck , I have other two  ig . And GPA is improving too\n└── Heck who even needs a job!",
    "The college is too influential to actually get in trouble or even try to bother about this. \nRemember RR campus is built on a lake (super illegal) and they have no problems whatsoever leaving heavy machinery and dangerous construction materials lying around lol\n├── Even ec campus has been constructed on a lake. That's why the frequent floods in the area\n└── EXACTLY, they've been lucky nothing's happened yet. Both the campuses are an impending disaster.",
    "Hi! I’m a reporter with The Hindu. If you or anyone from the student community would like to talk or share something about yesterday’s unfortunate incident, please DM!",
    "And more importantly, I hope the people responsible don't get to wash their hands clean of it. We're not cattle fodder to be thrown around campus. And the ones who played a role in this are should be held guilty and accountable.",
    "👏👏👏👏👏\n\nConcise, mature and spot on.\n\n*This* is what as a community we should be discussing: how the management could have handled the situation better and what needs to be done next. Not spewing hate and toxicity all over the comments, grabbing each others' necks, or throwing baseless accusations when concrete information isn't out yet. In the midst of all the news and rumours, its best to not take sides without knowing the full extent of the story. There are quite a few missing pieces without knowing which we cannot make an informed decision on which party is to blame.\n\nAll of us are clearly affected by this, lets focus this energy on actually solving the problem at hand and not turning on each other.\n\nGreat job OP! Thanks for showing us the right way.",
    "Well Written!!\n\nThank You for putting this out ❤️",
