    "December (might be different for first sem kids though)\n└── Like any tentative date? December starting or Dec ending?\n    ├── You can expect from Dec end to Jan first week range   \nFor us ( last yr) it was from jan 8th to 20th cuz they started a month late\n    │   └── Okay thank you!\n    └── last year when i was in third sem,  the end sems started on december 7th and ended on 22nd december or  one or two days after that. But they were over before christmas\n        └── Okay thanks!",
    "According to calendar of events it is from 28th nov to Dec 11\n└── Im not in first year\n    └── Okay thank you. hopefully the date doesn't collide with the wedding festivities.",
    "Start of december to end for the entire collage. You need to check the timetable to know."
