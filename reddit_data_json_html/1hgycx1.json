    "Time to pull up your socks OP. It's going to be really difficult with that GPA. Shut everything else, grind academics the next few semesters and pray to lady luck. A poor GPA cannot be compensated with DSA skills and a good profile.",
    "Hey, don't think too much about the end result of placements, ace ur isa, and as cliche as it sounds take it one step at a time. Also don't think too much about tier 1,2,3. First focus on getting that gpa above 7. You'll be eligible for 75% of the companies. \nDon't waste time at the start of your next semester, because once isa1 gets over, there is no coming back or \" I will shut up and study\" because you'll have assignments and isa 2 in no time. So be proactive, study hard, make notes at home. If you get above 85% in ur isas it would give you enough momentum and you'll be technically good enough to do well in the ESA. Don't learn for the sake of marks and study to become a good engineer as all 4th sem subjects are important fundamentals.",
