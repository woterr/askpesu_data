    "I think some people who did the internships last year did get converted",
    "Apple intern here wishing everybody all the best ❤️\nBrush up your DSA, keep your basics brushed up (OS specifically)\n├── Bro, what’s the bare minimum number of DSA LeetCode questions we should solve to be ready for cracking interviews?\n│   └── This number changes based on how comfortable you are with a given concept (because you should be approaching Leetcode concept wise). How do you judge comfort? When you can see a related problem you've never encountered before and recognize the pattern behind it\n└── Do you like the work culture there?\n    └── In my opinion (don't take it seriously, and definitely don't spam my DMs with gaalis) it's the best among the FAANGs work culture wise, even though there's not a super high level of collaboration between different verticals",
    "Around 30 people from our batch were selected for the internship and almost everyone got converted to full time too. But it could always be different for your batch\n└── yeah true , also apple came multiple times (maybe they wanted more staff). also an indication that many would get converted FTE.\n    └── Can we apply each time if they come multiple times or only once?",
    "Can someone tell me what does dual degree mean ?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k2o5szhjg6kf1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb97a7ebd39699ede01cec51449cc71628964a7e\n└── Btech+Mtech in 5 years itself. Offered by unis like bits and vit\n    └── Bits does not offer integrated mtech I believe.The offer MSc+Btech integrated programs for ex:MSC Phy+BE in subject that you get after first year depending on seat availability and cgpa.VIT and SRM do offer it.",
    "what is the required gpa for boys for apple this year ?\n└── 7 for everyone\n    └── but last year isnt that 9.x + gpa for boys for apple written in the placement sheet made by seniors?\n        ├── Eligible GPA ≠ Shortlisting GPA. Companies can set 7+ as minimum required to be eligible and then shortlist 9+.\n        │   └── ooh, got it thanks\n        └── It's final cutoff. Companies keep lesser gpa before writing OA and eventually increase the gpa if many students clear OA\n            └── so gpa is important 🥲, coz even 8 pointer will be rejected even if they cleared oa during shortlisting\n                └── Yep. I am facing the same problem.",

    "What are the other roles Apple Hires for apart from IS&amp;T ? What are the cutoffs for those roles &amp; How different will the OA be ?",
    "Is it possible for me to apply even if i have an offer from T1 company already? Cus its apple and it feels so wrong to miss out on a company like that 😭",
    "From which sem are they gonna recruit and is it only for cs or ece also has scope?",
    "They only came for one role IS&amp;T is this role worth it?\n└── IS&amp;T maintains a lot of the computing infra that Apple owns (data centers, networks etc.) so you'll definitely learn a lot about large enterprise scale systems (read as much documentation and stuff outside your work to learn more) \n\nBasically it's not just IT support\n    └── What are the other roles Apple hires for apart from IS&amp;T ?",
    "I'd like to know if we can sit for Apple OAs despite having a T1 job offer letter? Because missing out on a company like Apple just kinda hurts",
    "If your a girl easy yes, if not give your everything for a ppo"
