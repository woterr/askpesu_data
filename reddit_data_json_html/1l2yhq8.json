  "content": "Hey everyone, I just got done with my 6th semester - B. Tech CSE,  \nIâ€™m heading into placements in the next two months and had a quick question for those who've already been through it or know how the shortlisting process usually works.\n\nIâ€™ve got a CGPA of 7.64. While I know some companies mention a cutoff of 7.0, Iâ€™ve heard that in practice, they often end up shortlisting people who have 8.0 or even 8.5+.\n\nSo I was wondering â€“ how likely is it that I *donâ€™t* get shortlisted despite meeting the official cutoff? Is this common? Does it depend on the role or the number of applicants?\n\nWould really appreciate any insight or experiences you can share. Just trying to mentally prepare and plan accordingly.\n\nThanks in advance!",
