    "To justify that some people were standing on each other and blocking the view, I am first of all short. The only thing I could see was through my phone which I was holding up now they started tho block that also, I had not thrown any but thanked the guy next to me for doing that. If it had hit u my miss sorry but atleast have basic manners for short to med hight people",
