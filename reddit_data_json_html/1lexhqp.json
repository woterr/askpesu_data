    "Actually it's quite easy for you guys no offense, just the right time and the right people you know you will be in a team of pros And need not do anything\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Lol I don‚Äôt want to be in a group where all the work is done, neither do I want to be in a group where no one does anything that‚Äôs the problem",
    "Option 1: It's better to join your friend's team if you have the option.\n\nOption 2: If you don't have a team, the department will send a form for students without a team. And  new teams will be formed among those students.\n\nHowever,  most of the students in this group usually have a CGPA below 7,The problem with Option 2 is that there might be members who won't contribute at all .\n\nSo, better to go with Option 1.",
    "If u are in the 6-7 range , it's the easiest for u. It's quite tough to get good teams later on for people with 7-8 cgpa\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Why exactly\n    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Because many people are in that range so most teams will find their teammates in that range and at the end majority of the people left without a team will be people in the 7-8 region\n        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ I see makes sense....",
    "That won't be a problem. Just post your topic idea and ask in the class group if anyone wants to join"
