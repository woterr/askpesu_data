    "I am also a fresher. As far as our teachers have told, there will be 4ques-4marks(subjective) and 16ques-1,2mark (objective). Total 20 questions for 40marks. For objective you have to select the right option and for subjective you can either type or write the answer. Total 1hour will be given.\nPS: some teachers also said there could be 6mark questions\n└── Thank you for helping me"
