    "1. Definitely Algos for IR. Topics are easy and the assignments and project don't require too much effort either. \n\n2. Both are more or less on the same level. I took ML for Graphs(MLGA was what it was called for us) and both of them have similar grading schemes. ML for Graphs has more formulae and is a deep dive into one topic while TDL is more theoretical and a more surface level explanation of multiple topics.",
    "1. Algo for IR\n2. ML for Graphs\n└── I think ML for Graphs is on the same level as TDL. NAM is now merged with GT and this is a new subject. ML for Graphs goes in depth into one topic while TDL explores multiple topics more briefly. A lot of topics are the same among these too.\n    └── Ah that's a new update, I thought it was a new name for NAM. You're right then, thanks for the correction :)"
