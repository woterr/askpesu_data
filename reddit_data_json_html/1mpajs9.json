    "Is this oracle virtual box, have you tried using vmware?",
    "https://www.oracle.com/virtualization/virtualbox/\nDownload from this, should work\n└── is it different vm??!!\n    └── It is the same vm, but vm downloaded from here works properly. Other sites may have outdated versions which you may have downloaded. I too got this error initially, then I downloaded from the site which I linked previously, and was working fine",
