    "If you are hell bent on getting cse/ aiml then put those as your first / second option. \n\nUsually cse gets filled at 9.5 ish.. so just 1-2 get branch changed to cse. However AIML goes on till 8 so if you are considering cse branches then  \n\n1. CS \n\n2. AIML\n\nThis would be perfect preference.\n\nOnce branch change is done, its final they wont allow you to go back to old branch.\n├── What will be the cse cutoff in ec campus?\n│   └── 7.5 last time\n└── Tq❤️"
