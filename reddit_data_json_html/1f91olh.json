    "Your first question should've been if they happen in the first place\n├── Damn\n└── My dad has some connections in some tech companies based in USA, if he pulls some strings and get me an internship there. Will the college allow me to go? Like i have no idea about how internships are conducted in PES. Any supporting information is appreciated! Thank you!",
