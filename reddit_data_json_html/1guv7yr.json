    "chem was an overall better experience. physics cycle felt harder from the first week itself, especially phys and mech so I put a lot of effort to study. electrical in physics cycle is crazy ez tho compared to epd. I personally felt math was the same difficulty in both sems. \n\nchem gpa: 9.82\nphys gpa: 9.95\n└── unreal gpa",
    "This varies from individual to individual but personally I found chem cycle easier (my sgpa increased by 0.23)\n\nIt's because I found chem easier than phy (this is common for most people, atleast for my batch). I was also extremely bad at mechanical in phy cycle. At the end of the day it depends on which subjects you find easier.",
    "Chem Cycle: 9.68\nPhy Cycle: 9.23\nCurrently at a 9.45",
    "Physics felt easier, 9.34 in chem and 9.73 in Phy. Also i liked C more than Python, physics was 2nd sem for me I was more comfortable ig",
    "Most subjects in P cycle more of logic and less of mugging up bs. C cycle on the contrary is JUST mugging up.  So yeah, it depends on what you're good at.",
    "7.2 in phy\n7.8 in chem\nBut tbh i didn’t study a lot during phy cycle so the difference isn’t that big\n└── :) sure",
    "found chem  harder but depends on individual"
