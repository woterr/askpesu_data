    "For acca : \n1) depends on your ability to make friends and explore \n2) there are various sports which you can do whenever you want ( basketball , football, squash,badminton,table tennis etc)\n3) 75% and above to be maintained \n4) uniform ( which is provided by the uni) \n5) edit : if by important papers you mean the professional levels, yes they do give coaching but I heard the seniors saying it's not good and some say it's good."
