    "UGC Guidelines say that they have to refund money till 30 September. But I see a lot of institutes like PES, IIIT H, BITS having different guidelines. Don't know what's the route here.\n└── yeah i've had a friend who got all their money back even after commencement of classes and some people really struggled with the management so dk what to think atp\n    └── Then be stubborn with the management and get your money back.",
