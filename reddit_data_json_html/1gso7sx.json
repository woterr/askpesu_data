    "I use eye drops to prevent dryness and itching, I use them twice a day atleast (or whenever they get too dry). Also take regular and timely breaks from studying, and make sure when you're on a break from your laptop, you aren't on your phone aA challenge for your generation, I know). Taking a break from one screen to be on another screen doesn't solve the problem.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ it feels like your spying on us. also, when are you going to evolve ?\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ No reason to evolve when all the incoming PESts are mentally devolving\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ Wait till you get added to the most brainrot chat groups of the incoming pests. There is no escaping that\nâ””â”€â”€ U are the same gen as us ðŸ˜­",
    "Take a break from the screen every 20-30 min. Stroll around. DO NOT rub your eyes.",
    "I'm thinking of buying lenskart blu for the same reason, but I'm not sure it'll actually help\nâ”œâ”€â”€ It doesnâ€™t\nâ”œâ”€â”€ none of those \"screen glasses\" help.\nâ””â”€â”€ Hey, currently using those. It helps to a certain extent but it doesn't protect your eyes from strain etc. it does help in reducing the harshness of light and it helps with sunlight glare in classrooms.",
    "get your eyes checked, if they burn too quickly its probably a sign of something much worse brewing",
    "My eyes are used to my screentime atp. Guess I'll be having problems when I grow older",
    "Just take regular breaks if you feel soreness. Breaks as in going downstairs for a walk or something."
