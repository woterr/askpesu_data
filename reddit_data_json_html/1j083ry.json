    "with that percentile if you applied to pes maybe natural selection is in play\n├── My parents forced me to lol. It's not my choice at all, but they've been bugging me to check this\n│   └── Yeah I mean if u got 98-97 would make sense to apply to pes as a back up but at 99.6 ur bound to get good seats in nits and iiits.\n│       └── He can get IIIT bangalore cse with that i think\n├── I saw 99.6 and I was like wit this competition where tf do i get a seat\n└── Are you a PES student?\n    └── yes",
    "my brother in christ dont do this to yourself. you'll hate yourself.  \nwith that kinda percentile go to some iiit or any decent nit that u get.  \nand if u really really want to, come in thru cet, i can assure you u'll easily get in. the 5ish lakh fee thru mains with that kinda score is REALLY not worth it",
    "pretty sure you get cse in RR but im waiting for the merit list too its said tentative so might not release today\n└── How much did you get in mains? Is PES your first preference?\n    └── I’ve gotten a 96.5 and I’m still not sure about it being my first preference right now",
    "Called up PES they said they are having some issues and would post it by the end of today or tmr. So most prolly its gonna come out tmr.\n└── Hopefully it's today. My mom won't stop asking me to refresh the page lol\n    └── imo its gonna come out tmrw, Idts anyone will still be working, day is almost over\n        └── Ah probably, Thank you!",
    "Have you applied for KCET? Cause you might get CSE RR thru kcet (fees is 1 lakh) instead of paying 5 lakhs thru JEE Mains\n└── I have applied for both, but KCET is yet to happen\n    └── Oh nice...\n        └── Are you a PES student? Can I DM you?\n            └── Hey dude,\n\ndid you email them regarding prefrences?What did they say?"
