    "worse campus, worst branch in that campus, harder papers than RR and less research opportunities/worse profs\n\nharder to study -&gt; harder to get gpa -&gt; harder to get shortlisted for company OAs\n\nmoreover competing with 2k+ CSE/CSE AIML Students\n\nthere's your answer",
    "not all that bad if you are interested in vlsi",
    "8th sem ECE student at the EC Campus here.\n\nTake it up. Professors are highly qualified and knowledgeable. Some of them might be a pain in the ass but their expertise in the subject compensates it. Plus I personally like the campus way better than the Ring Road campus. It's bigger and less populated. \n\nI have had a good off campus offer in a core company, but chose to go with a software developer role which I got on-campus.",
    "Just get the degree and hope for the best."
