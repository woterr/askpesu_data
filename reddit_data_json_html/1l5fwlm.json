  "content": "So guys had pes round 1 counselling.  \nSo i live in electronic city and i chose cse ec today, but almost immediately regretted my choice of not choosing pes rr cse. I asked the ceo person giving speech and he told i could change my choice to pes rr in second round counselling. The thing I want to ask is whether pes has bus facility from electronic city to rr campus. If some senior could enlighten me on this topic, it'll be really helpful! Thanks!",

    "Hey i live in electronic City too and I asked about transportation , he told me there's no buses coming from electronic City \n└── Are you sure about that? I asked the lady doing registration and she told me yes bus does come to ec, but it did feel like she just said that so i could hurry, lol\n    └── Ye pretty sure although do ask again ig and lemme know if they say yes \n        └── I see :((",
    "why do u regret your decision tho?\n└── Since like everyone above me choose rr cse,  i was like 2nd or 3rd one to chose ec\n    └── look at the faq's both the campuses are practically the same, the only reason i chose rr is cuz i live kinda close to rr campus\n        └── Yeah that's why taking ec",
