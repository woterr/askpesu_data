  "title": "Is PES University worth it for MCA? Placement, faculty, crowd? Any other MCA suggestions in Bengaluru?",
  "content": "Hey folks,  \nI'm currently exploring options for MCA in Bengaluru and came across PES University. It looks pretty hyped up, but I wanted to ask—**is it really worth it for MCA?**\n\nSpecifically, I’m curious about:\n\n* **Placements** – How are they for MCA students? Do companies actually recruit MCA grads seriously here or is it more BTech-focused?\n* **Faculty** – Are the teachers actually good or is it more self-study based?\n* **Crowd/vibe** – What's the peer group like? Competitive, chill, too serious?\n\nAlso, if anyone has other good suggestions for **MCA colleges in Bengaluru**, please do drop them. I’m looking for a college with decent ROI, good exposure, and preferably not super suffocating in terms of rules.\n\nThanks in advance!",
