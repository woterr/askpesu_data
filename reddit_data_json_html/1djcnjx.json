    "Anything with paneer is decent . Amaatra and ec campus(food court )food is same. But u get 2 choices at ec campus for mess, vakula and food court, food court is better imo. Sunday dinner food is also good , with chicken and veg biryani and some paneer dish with veg burger and ice cream too at times\nâ””â”€â”€ Thank you !"
