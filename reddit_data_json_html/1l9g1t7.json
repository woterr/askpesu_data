    "ISAs were very easy. All MCQs but each ISA contributes only 10% to the total marking. Personally, I felt ESA was tougher compared to PYQ.. also because I did not go through much of the theoretical parts for ISA (as mcqs were easy to guess). ESAs are still manageable and you can get A easily if you show some interest. You will have to work hard on Labs and Hackathons as many of my peers lost marks there.\n\nOverall the subject is scoring and fun provided you like logic and little math. If you are into cybersec this is the best elective for you. However if you are into ML and data field I would suggest you to take DA.",
    "+1 , is it useful?"
