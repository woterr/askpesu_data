    "You require only mechanics text book, if you are in chem cycle\nâ””â”€â”€ Yeah Iam in chem",
    "only ppt is enough for all subject + PESU Notes (9.8 cgpa I have using only this)\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Hey, was wondering what you used to do on a daily basis after college and what you did like a week before tests (ISA and ESA's)\nWhat material did you prioritise/refer?\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Hey, see I will be real with you. Listen to class proper and chill after college everyday! No need to make notes etc, just listen and understand what they are teaching. 1 week before ISA/ESA start the prep and my priority was always Slides. Be really really good with slides, like go through each page in the slides properly and in depth that's it. I have gotten 10 SGPA only using slides!! One more tip - Study for ISA same as ESA. For example for ISA 1 you will have unit 1 and 2 (Study for ISA like ESA like you are preparing for subjective exam). This makes ESA very easy as you have already covered all 4 units and you have to just revise again. Also i like to keep writing notes/Scribbling my notebook when i read slides (like important points helps me to remember things properly)\nâ”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ I'll definitely keep that in mind. Thanks for the advice!\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ Wow,may I ask what and all extra related to cs/programming did you learn in your first year? Or concentrated only on the subjects\nâ”‚           â””â”€â”€ so yeah i concentrated more on c and python like mastered these two languages. Other subject just for marks/gpa i studied. I did some web development at home free time (Helped me little)\nâ”œâ”€â”€ WowðŸ˜²\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Damm\nâ””â”€â”€ What about numericals? What material do we use for them?\n    â””â”€â”€ slides was enough + pesu notes sometimes",
    "Don't forget anything from classnotes and ppt. You can borrow the TB from the library if you need it. Just don't get any grade lower than C and You're fine."
