    "We Mtech students had it in 2nd sem, and the CS guys said it's harder than what we studied in the last 6 years because they didn't build any base. Asking to imagine and algorithm is cursed",
    "Yes been there. That whole course feels forced on to ECE imho.\nâ””â”€â”€ Yeah Iâ€™ve noticed, though the ECE hod is much better than other HODs, all the profs there are very old schoolâ€¦ not a great way of learning, and they donâ€™t listen even if they complain\n    â”œâ”€â”€ My capstone was in computer vision along with reinforcement learning under professor Niranjana BK. Your old school remark applies to her a lot ðŸ˜‚.\n    â””â”€â”€ You mean the RR Hod? Coz ajey kinda sucks",
    "What the hell, I had ML in sem 6 and I didn't have any coding",
    "highly \\~\\~retarded\\~\\~ regarded college",
    "Finally someone spoke outside.... One of the dumbest thing to do.... Moreover some profs asked us to note the outputðŸ¤¡",
    "Nahin Sir",
    "Not a big deal I guess!"
