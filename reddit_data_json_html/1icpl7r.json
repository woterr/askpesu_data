    "they did isa1\\*0.5+ assignment marks. they will fix it soon\n├── what does final isa mean actually?\n│   └── final isa is basically everything other than your esa scores which finally adds up to 100. for 5 credit courses, we have additional 20 marks from lab. so add those scores to final isa and divide by 1.2 to get raw score(out of 100). this raw score is used to give your grade(11 marks difference for each grade)  \nfinal isa = (isa 1 + isa 2)\\*0.5 + assignment\n│       └── It updated.. Thanks for the reply...\n└── ohhk thanks"
