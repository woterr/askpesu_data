    "if fees is not an issue then i would say msrit",
    "It's mostly equivalent. Your life or opportunities won't change much either way. \n\nMake your decision based on the fee, location and campus amenities or something like that",
    "Msrit",
    "Same situation but msrit cse comedk\n├── Dming you\n└── you are joining all college maybe lol (i meant your flair)",
    "Ofc pes ai ml + kcet so high advantages\n└── EC campus also?\n    └── Yeah both rr and ec has combined placement just focus on what branch you prefer . If you like aiml then pes if cyber then msrit. Here you gotta look into branch not college.",
    "See even the distance if u have less traveling time ull be more free personally if I travel too much I'll be tired as shit for collge and won't have mood to study at home.\n└── I am out of Bangalore student. Will br staying in hostel\n    └── Msrit I would say  if no fee issue if not then pes ec is also gud only it's not bad",
    "MSRIT is better PES has very high intake\n├── Pes&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n│   └── OK sir pes greatest college in india\n│       └── No saaaaarrrrrrrr\n└── Yes PES do have higher intake than MSR.\n    └── But compare placements "
