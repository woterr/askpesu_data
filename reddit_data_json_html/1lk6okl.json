    "heyy, pharm fresher here, they just asked me why do you wanna take pharmacy and my 10th and 12th marks so ig most prolly they'll ask you really simple questions like these\nâ””â”€â”€ Finally sb replied. Tqsm..\n    â””â”€â”€ no issues, btw did you get in?\n        â””â”€â”€ No yaarðŸ˜”. It's gone into waiting list. It's risky as if I pay the fee and didn't get in, it might be late to join anywhere else.\n            â””â”€â”€ ahh dw, you'll get in, how was the interview?\n                â””â”€â”€ Was easy. Hey can you ask if any seats have opened up ? Cause my family's rushing me to join some other college, and I really don't wanna go to any of the other colleges, please\n                    â””â”€â”€ hey, check dm"
