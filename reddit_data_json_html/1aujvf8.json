  "content": "I am currently in 6th semester CSE branch, we had selected a research paper to work on initially, but the panel wasn't convinced whatever we were trying to do would even be feasible or not (It was some image processing stuff in medical domain)  They told us that it wasn't easy to gather the required dataset especially in medical field, and suggested us to shift to some other topic altogether, we selected some other blockchain related project, and we also decided that it would be a wise idea to talk to one of the panel members in regards to this project. Now today afternoon she again rejected our topic saying that someone else has already taken this topic, and told us to select some other topic once again. Now I only have 2 days of time left to select a topic, make ppt, and also give the presentation, I am feeling hopeless about what to do right now, next week we also have our ISA, and in our first capstone review meeting, our topic isn't even getting approved. It's really freaking frustrating, not to mention our capstone guide, who himself doesn't have an idea of what's going on, telling us both the times that whatever topic we have selected is a good topic and can be taken forward to the panel, only for it to get rejected, I am really feeling low, and I don't know how to proceed further from here...",

    "This should be Uma or Nagasundari lol\n└── OMG how did you know?\n    └── Had a really really traumatic capstone experience under these two🙏🙏 Anyway I've already graduated 🙏\n        └── Dayummn, I am really unlucky to have Uma ma'am in my panel, if she rejects this time as well, I am telling them upfront do whatever you want, I don't care at this point.\n            └── I'm telling from my personal experience... capstone grades specially in the 7th sem will be in the hands of the panel... So u unfortunately can't be on their bad side... 🥲\n                └── Oh dear, anyways I've been told that 7th sem grades don't matter much for placements, I'll just do the bare minimum and focus on improving my DSA and just get a damn job.\n                    └── Yes you're right...it doesn't matter for placements... Don't let this get into ur head too much..",
    "Chill dude... we had the same issue. Just keep pitching ideas. They'll accept it...  \n\n\n  \nPS: discussing with your mentor before the panel might be helpful.."
