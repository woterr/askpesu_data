    "Exam will be in December, the registration will open this month. Keep checking the backlog registration tab in pesuacademy. Your teachers will also let you know but better to just keep checking",
    "Don't register for both subjects at the same time unless you're very confident of passing them. You still have time, you can write one more subject after 4th sem. Pls talk with your mentor for more guidance.",
