My other options are shiv nadar ece and thapar ece vlsi (might be upgraded to cse core) . So I wanted to know how hard it is to get a good placement because I saw the intake is quite a lot. What would you advise a fresher to do in first yr?",

    "It's pretty competitive. The batch strength increases every year by a large margin but companies don't increase their intake. So the competition does rise sharply with every batch. Just go through the placement sheets on the FAQs - you will see how many get selected per company - the average per company would probably be around 20, discounting mass recruitment companies. \n\nAs for what to do in the first year, my primary suggestion would be to find your interests and figure out which field in CS is your calling. This process takes time, starting early helps. There are also a few handy courses I recommend covering over the summer before first year begins, such as the MIT Missing Semester and Harvard CS50. \n\nThis has been explained in a lot of detail already over the years and there are multiple such posts from the past. The FAQs are your friend. And also the search bar.",
    "As rowlett has mentioned go through cs50 and [Mit Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) course for the first year."
