  "content": "I'm a fresher for BTech CSE EC campus. I'll be moving in BLR for the first time and unfortunately I don't qualify for the EC campus hostel (I don't have a local guardian and I can't really submit a demand draft right now in person).   \nI'm thinking of shifting to a PG for a year or so until I find good friends to move into a flat. However most of the PGs nearby (Zolo and stayzone) are unisex which I don't think am very comfortable with. The nice girls PGs are kinda far away from the campus.   \nAny suggestions? Anyone looking for rooms or PGs this year?",

    "It will be difficult to find an incoming student opting for PG/apartment, especially if you're trying to find someone over reddit. I'd suggest posting this on your batch WhatsApp group and discord server. Or if you're ok with seniors, post on their groups (ask around on discord for the link). It'll probably be easier (and safer) to find someone through the WhatsApp groups, plus odds are you'll find a senior who might be willing to move, compared to incoming students who usually don't go for these options.\n└── okayy thankss",
