    "Harder the fruit , harder the assignment , more marks its worth\n└── What if I'm the hardest",
    "Your assignments in each subject are structured into three different problem sets, banana, orange and jackfruit, with banana being the easiest and jackfruit being the hardest.\n\nThe structuring of these problem sets is different for each subject.",
    "Similar to lev1, lev2, lev3 in jee",
    "Basically it’s an analogy, the harder it is to peel the fruit the sweeter/reward the fruit is, banana is the assignment which is relatively the easiest and jackfruit being the hardest and carries more marks"
