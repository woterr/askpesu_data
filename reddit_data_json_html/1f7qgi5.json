    "Maybe the pool of \"available seats\" is taken as ALL the seats in that branch. So if freshers withdraw, say 150 seats, then maybe 5-10 seats are converted into said \"available seats\". Just speculating. I have the same question.",
    "They are not. That is the reason the ratio of classrooms of cs to other branches goes whack after first year.",
    "Idk too but it helps if you want to change branches. But it's not possible to change after second year."
