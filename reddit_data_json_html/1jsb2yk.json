I genuinely think people there had no civic sense lol we’re all students, they had no sense of spatial awareness whatsoever. I get it, I’m not that salty to not understand that it’s expected in such audience. But I got elbowed in my chest 7 times because THEY FORMED A CIRCLE AND DANCED?? Bro it’s Mohit Chauhan you don’t have to do allat😭 everyone’s sweaty and swamped up here be considerate? I don’t think I caused anyone any inconvenience it’s really not that hard lol have fun and let others have fun too. Ts pmo icl.",

    "What do you expect from concerts lol? There's gonna be chaos even if you spend a grand on your tickets. Hence the reason I don't like the idea of concerts.\n├── Exactly! And the moment you say you don’t like concerts, they hit you with the “oh wow, became cool? being different from the rest of the crowd” Like bro, since when did having personal preferences become a fashion statement? 😂 Some people really need a hobby fr.\n│   └── well i don't give two fucks about such people. In fact i love getting downvoted because that shows the number of butthurt people lmao.\n└── Fair tbh I js wished they were lil considerate:)\n    └── Can't expect that from everyone tho :). At the end you enjoyed the concert, all that matters.",
