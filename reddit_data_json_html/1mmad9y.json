    "Anyone aware if any seats are remaining for kcet round 2. My rank is 400X hence thought of checking if there is any chance\n└── they said that there might not be a second round PESU KCET counselling ,and the classes might start from (18 august/25 august ) so it is highly unlikely for a round 2"
