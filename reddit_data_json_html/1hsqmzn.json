    "That's my comment lol. This was what was told to us during the semester orientation. So ig it's really in place.Â \nâ””â”€â”€ not new tho. this is what happens everytime the topper doesnt have a 100. guess the topper got a 89 is some subject.\n\n  \nthey explained the same thing to us in our second sem too",
    "If the mapping has indeed been officially updated, then the new one should be printed on the back of the grade sheet you will get. Check it out when you get it.",
    "Relative grading was done, everyone has inflates grades, now be happy and shut up\nâ””â”€â”€ I wanted to know if this is implemented for everyone or just higher semesters ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­\n    â””â”€â”€ we wont have it lol dw",
    "Like first of all the grading scheme was changed by 1 mark not five marks, and then the grades are inflated atleast for the 5 sem, because it seems they want to boost it so that more people could take part in placements, this was the info from a teacher\nâ””â”€â”€ So the 11-mark difference thing is real?",
    "To be honest, this has always been the case lol"
