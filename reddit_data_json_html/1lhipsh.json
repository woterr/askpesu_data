And when you shut the room door - they make a big fuss - oh why the fuck are you closing your door ? your doing something wrong hai na ? \n\n  \nwhen you put on earphones / audio headsets and study they seem to have an issue with that too - it will damage your ears - but bruh yall making so much noise ???????\n\n  \nif someone has any solution to this then please send",
