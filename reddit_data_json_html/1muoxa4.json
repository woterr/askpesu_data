  "content": "I've joined mechanical engineering in pes rr campus and classes start on 25th August, I live near JP nagar 8th phase and wanted to know how to commute ( don't prefer college bus as timings will be restricted... uk for using facilities/library... or am i overthinking?) do i need to get a 2 wheeler? BMTC takes little long and is unreliable. \n\nI also wanted to know the timings of college and classes in general. And last thing do I NEED a laptop or any other items? \n\nIt'll be of great help as my dad is also asking 🙏🙏",

    "pretty sure getting a 2 wheeler will be cheaper over the 4 years + you get more flexibility\n└── yeah I came to the conclusion but my dad is probably going to buy it maybe at the end of the year so until then i gotta manage somehow ;-;(will bmtc be fully functioning at 6 in the morning ?)",
    "2 wheeler &gt;&gt;&gt;BMTC&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;college bus in terms of price and flexibility. Morning timings are 8 for odd semester and 8:45 for even semesters. It is better to get a laptop atleast in first year since some cse courses are also there.(yoi can borrow one from someone for 1 year). \n\n2nd year onwards it depends on your course, if needed buy one.\n├── Can I DM you?\n│   └── Sure\n└── I don't think ill be getting two wheeler until December or Jan, so until then do I ride with bmtc? then ill have to leave house at like 6:15 or 6:30 and will busses be there at that time?\n    ├── Check the moovit app for bus timings as well as route near your home, but mostly it should be, many people come via bmtc.\n    └── Check google maps for timings. There's an arrive by time option. \n\nAlso try out tummoc app for bus passes. Momthly passes come for around 2k (cheaper than 2 way travel for some cases)",
