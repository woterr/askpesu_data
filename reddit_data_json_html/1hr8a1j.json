    "You can try for internships even after 6th sem. Placements start from 7th sem. There's no fixed time to prepare for internship tests. They're not like your regular exams. You have to apply and prepare for them on the go.\n├── If I try for internships after 6th sem, then will I be late for the good companies’ placements?\n│   └── Not really, more and more companies come up until the end of your 8th sem.\n└── but its compulsory to finish an internship before starting of 7th sem right?  \nwhat if I dont get one?   \nAlso what percent of the CS department normally gets an internship?\n    └── No, you have to finish an internship at least by the end of 8th sem. You also have the option of doing summer internship before the start of 7th sem but it's not compulsory. If you don't get summer internship, you can apply for summer courses provided by the college.\n        └── Oh I see thanks for the clarification"
