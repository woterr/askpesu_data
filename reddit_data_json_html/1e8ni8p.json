    "Don't worry; as others have said, you will not face any difficulties. The demographic of PES is comprised mostly of kids raised in good/well-recognised English-medium schools in Bangalore (an effect of the inflated fees lol), so almost everyone prefers English over their native languages. There is no discrimination or ill-treatment of north Indians (and I say this as the conventional \"outsider\" to this city, but was born and raised here).\n\nHowever, since you are moving to a different state, it is good to pick up basic phrases that will help make life a little easier. As long as you don't keep sticking to \"Kannada gothilla\" for everything and show a little effort in learning basic sentences, numbers etc, you won't be ill-treated.\n├── That helps a lot. Thank you\n└── Why bro?\n\nOp be brave!!!!\nSay on their face kannada gothilllaaa and on top of that say \nHindi is the offcial  langauage of the country saar\nYou learn hindi\n😝😝😝😝\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPs -sarcasm  lol\n    ├── I think you meant to type \"national\" language lol. Hindi is a recognised official language but we do not have a national language.\n\nAnd yeah OP do not do this (unless you want to get beaten up by auto goons).\n    │   └── Do this op\nPes median icse s 12lpa\nWith e lafda  you can get that  per month + bigg boss offer\n😝😝😝🤑🤑\n    └── Seems like you need to go back to school",
    "Whatever you see in the media is highly exaggerated , Bluru and Pes is an extremely safe place for everyone. Don't think too much and good luck.\n└── Thank you so much.",
    "Unless u want to be friends with local goons,hindi and english works fine almost everywhere.Just make sure u travel via booked autos instead of hiring them in person then 90 percent threat is off\n├── Tbf as an outsider it would be a massive flex if your friend circle includes local goons\n│   ├── Yeah it is.But I was talking abt Sarjapur ppl💀.                                Everyday I wake up, I read that someone got harassed there.\n│   └── Yeah just be their cashcow\n└── Thanks. That helps.",
    "Don't worry, there are so many people talking in hindi. In fact just knowing English is more than enough\n└── Yeah. Thanks",
    "Dw u will be fine\n└── Thank you 🤞🏻",
    "most of the North Indian hate u see online is just made by corny kids who rage bait), it's pretty chill in reality compared to how u perceive it online. just learning a few local slangs, will help a lot when interacting with people who aren't that good in English here.\n└── Thank you for the advice!",
    "Reddit is really a great place to seek help.",
    "Tbh I have met more outsiders than Bangaloreans in this college so dw",
    "Ppl say that shit on internet but irl u wont face shit.  \nI went to checkout pesu and the dude started talking to me in Telugu after finding out my name.",
    "Ya i mean we ruthless kannadigas love picking on lone northies but otherwise ye\n├── Op better take this seriously ಠ⁠_⁠ಠ\n└── Northeast too,left PU cause of it",
    "I wouldn't say that you'd necessarily have a problem talking to people. But the thing is that most people tend to be friends people who speak their native language like most of the people in my  friend group are Hindi speakers while most of the kids in my other friend's friend group are Telugu speakers\n \nBut yeah you wouldn't have a problem talking to people one on one if that's what you're concerned about. \n\nRahi baat teachers ki, most of them only speak in English while teaching causee that's the university's rule.\n\nLastly I would like to say that the english people speak here in bangalore tends to be a bit different from what were used to up in the north so you may have some sort of difficulties getting used to it\n└── Thank you. Appreciate it.\n    └── Kaha se h tu\n        ├── Damn waha pe bhi pessat Hota h\n        ├── Uttar pradesh\n        └── Aap??\n            └── Delhi",
    "Bro it's Bengaluru, \n ppl here are multilingualism, \nJust try slowly to learn basic kannada after coming that's more than enough",
    "brudder u gettin bullied\n└── I am a bully 😈\n    └── Doredaddy approved✅",
    "Ig you'll face some difficulties in boys hostel but apart from Banashankari region where  many locals are concentrated it's all chill ,the best areas would be indiranagar, Koramangala , HSR once you graduate\n└── Thank you",
    "Kaha se ho?\n└── Uttar pradesh"
