Will it make a huge difference in my placement sitting later on?\n    └── I'm not a student in pes, but an aspirant if u are confused by any chance.. \n\nFrom my research, placements are pooled in pes so there will be no difference in placements.. \n\nAnd according to one of the most active seniors of this sub u/rowlet-owl choose cse over aiml..\n        └── Aight thank you so much! I was really confused as to what to choose between those both",
