    "Choose PES EC CSE: better branch choice and college at KCET fees.\n└── Could you please elaborate as I'm really confused as to what is the difference between both colleges. Also fees is not really an issue for me.\nThank you! \n    └── Firstly, the branch itself is a much better option. Core CS is better than a specialised branch like AIML. Check the post from the FAQs: [https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/14c1iym/faqs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/14c1iym/faqs/)\n\nSecondly, better placements (although not by much). PES has a much better placement record, one of the best in the state. \n\nThirdly, more academic rigour pushes you to do better. The crowd is amazing and top notch at PES with alumni at great places today. \n\nThe only major con is that PES is very strict and hectic, your college life will never be close to what you might get at BMS.",
    "Stuck in the same situation \nCore CSE in BMS or PES \n(both through KCET)",
    "PES any day better than BMSCE\n└── Could you please elaborate? \nThank you!",
