  "content": "Guys I wanted to opt for the college bus transportation this year and I reached out to administration about it. They gave me a link and asked me to call the number based on route number, but the person isn't picking up the call, and the website form is still outdated (dated last year). I had a few questions which I hope y'all can answer cause I haven't seen the answers around (sorry if I missed it😭) :\n\nAnyone else who has opted for college transportation?\nCan I please know how it works, and whether it's worth the fees?\nDo they drop you in case you have to stay back due to club/college work?\nWhom do I reach out to now, and by when?",

    "College bus has fixed timings. They usually come very early to the pickup point in the morning, comes around 6:30 to my stop (ofc this will differ depending on how far u stay frm the campus). And it won't leave before 5 in the frm the campus to drop u back. So, on half days u will have to wait till 5. And incase u have to stay back beyond 5 u will have to commute back home on ur own. \n\nAnd i would like to add the college timings differ in the odd and even sems, i.e., in odd sems the classes start at 8 and in the even sems they start at 8:45. Irrespective of this the bus timings remain the same for both the sems.\n└── Thank you so muchhhh😭😭✨️✨️",
