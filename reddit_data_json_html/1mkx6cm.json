  "content": "So, im in a dilemma right now, pes says they want kea rank card as : \n\nYour KCET Rank Card (taken from the Karnataka Government KEA portal) which should clearly show your Application Number, CET Number, KCET Engineering Rank and the KCET marks in Physics, Chemistry and Math - **This is mandatory**. This will be validated before you are allowed for the seat selection process\n\n  \nproblem with kea's result sheet on their website is that it doesnt show CET Number (different from application number)\n\nverification slip has everything except kcet marks (which is more important imho)\n\nso im confused what document to take\n\nplease advice\n\nthank you",
