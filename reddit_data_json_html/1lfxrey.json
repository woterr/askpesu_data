  "content": "I am a nepali national looking into joining either PESU OR BMSCE for Btech in CSE as freshman. Each will cost me overall including hostel around 25 lakh ic for BMSCE and 35 lakh ic for PESU. I wanted to join PESU as there are lots of opportunities other than academics like hackathons and stuff plus the placements are way better than that of BMSCE. The infrastructure is better the accommodationa are better but at the end what I am not sure about is if PESU is really worth the extra 10lakh. Please help!",

    "If you're interested in CS and willing to spend some time studying , you can easily aim for scholarships which will reduce the  fees by 40-50 % each semester. If that happens then PES would be the best bet considering the fees will almost equalize",
    "Pesu CS is very good. Some even compare it to NITK. If you can manage the 10L dent and really work hard in your ug - it should be worth it.\n├── Who's \"some\" ?\n├── Who compares it to nitk 💀\n├── Bro legit said \"even compare it to NITK\". LMAO\n│   └── Hello mister respectfully pes is genuinely comparable to nitk.\nAcademics in pes is way harder than ppl think it is and idk what more do ppl expect form a university\nIt had a very asthetic and modern campus and really good placements\nApart from having overcrowded canteens there are really no downsides\nPes students probably even get the biggest annual fests in blr\n│       ├── And people say that *I* am working for the management sheesh\n│       ├── I want to jump off after reading this but then NITK will start becoming comparable to PESU in terms of suicide cases 😶‍🌫️🥀🥀\n│       │   └── I wouldn't have brought up numbers, but since you are, I think you should know that PES has had 4 in its history. I do believe that NITK has more, at least from my preliminary search. \n\nDon't spread misinformation.\n│       │       └── Well PES had 4 within a span of 10 months and more ,  that too in the recent past. But imagine actually digging up numbers when u know that ur clg has some shitass academic pressure leading to these lmao. And no , thankfully nitk doesnt have more.\n│       │           └── Buddy, you're the one who jokingly compared numbers to begin with. Quit playing the fool, nobody denied the academic pressure. If you're going to blatantly make statements, back them up with facts. We don't entertain misinformation here. And FYI, the first was in 2012, with 3 in the last 4 years. \n\nAnd you might want to educate yourself. Please read up on your college's incidents as well, instead of being a clown on a different college's sub.\n│       ├── Bro the crowd becomes a major factor and there's no way,\n nitk crowd=~ pes crowd\n│       └── Insane copium\n└── Are u talking about pes ec or pes rr??\n    └── Does it matter :)",
    "bro if you work hard in PESU you can get really good scholarship i would recommend checking their website ones and see what kinds of scholarship you can get for good CGPA.",
    "BMSCE is chill but PES opportunities are no joke. Worth the extra 10L imo"
