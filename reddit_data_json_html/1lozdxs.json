    "It's not true. All placement emails are sent to both campuses at the same time, as part of the same thread (you can even see the recipients are both campuses). And the kid clearly doesn't know what he's talking about cause there is no \"sitting first\". You get a placement email from a company via placement cell, then you apply for it, then the company sends you a test link. PES is no longer in the process after that, the rest is handled by the company. \n\nNot sure why people constantly trying to defame EC. Don't trust any information about campuses unless it's coming from this subreddit. There is a lot of misinformation out there.\n\nIf you can, send a link to their comment. Man needs to be educated.",
    "long live pesu mods, and let these people cope as hard as they can that rr campus is superior to ec. They themselves are prolly studying from a worse college and don't want to believe the potential ec campus has, let them struggle for their infosys/cognizant dream job lol.",
    "Rr sits first what does that even mean"
