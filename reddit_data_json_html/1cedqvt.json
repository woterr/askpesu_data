  "content": " \n\nMy sister got an admit from RV and Jain for B. des. She qualified UCEED.\n\nRV- Heard RV has a good reputation for engineering but university is new. But it doesn't have an AICTE affiliation.\n\nJain- heard had issues and a rich kid club.\n\nPES- heard some good reviews, but no placement record.\n\nCould you tell which one is better? I heard RV has good faculty, PES is another option but she has to write PESSAT. Please share your input. Regards.",
