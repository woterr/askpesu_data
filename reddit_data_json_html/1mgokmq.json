  "title": "[Question]Need help with VPN alternatives for bypassing Wifi restrictions",
  "content": "It looks like Cloudflare Warp has been blocked, which was a really useful tool for bypassing network restrictions. Are there any good alternatives that work similarly? Or any methods to use the campus WiFi without running into these annoying blockages?\n\nAlso, if anyone here plays Valorant – is there a way to avoid those high ping warnings while playing on this restricted network? Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! 😭",
