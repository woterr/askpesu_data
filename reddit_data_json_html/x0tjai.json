    "Capstone Project reviews happen in 4 stages over the course of the semester and you are graded independently for each stage. They expect improvements to be made per stage, with a certain set of expected outcomes at each stage (initial results, first paper draft, model architecture etc) and you will be graded only on the parameters set for a certain stage. Hence, if you don't show progress in one stage but show it in the next one, you'll end up losing marks in both for not meeting the expectations. \n\nIf you haven't made any progress at all since your last semester then it indeed it pretty bad. They usually expect a baseline architecture with initial results at the beginning of Capstone 2. If you don't end up showing any results at the end of the semester then all your teammates will end up losing marks and end up with a poor grade. \n\nTLDR - they might not give you an F but your grade will be really low if there is nothing to show. Add to the fact that it's 6 credits and you'll essentially be looking at a huge missed opportunity to get an S/A grade and boost your CGPA"
