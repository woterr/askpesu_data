    "We are doomed \n\nGG\nâ””â”€â”€ our batch was doomed from the start ðŸ˜­\n    â””â”€â”€ Lol it was similar last year as well, sem1 classes started from 4th sep and bootstrap was the week before that\n        â””â”€â”€ Umm, dumb question maybe but..\n\nwhat is bootstrap?\n            â””â”€â”€ It is a week full of activities by different departments of college on each day. You'll have mechanical workshop, will visit electronics lab and learn some stuff, a hackathon style design thinking event, and community service iirc. You get to sort of have a look at various departments and meet new people",
