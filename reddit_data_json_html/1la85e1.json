  "content": "I have an sgpa of 8.38 in physics cycle and expecting an okish cgpa in chem cycle, for argument sake, say 8.75, will I be able to improve my cgpa in the upcoming sems in ECE or is it gonna be harder and harder, and this (8.5) is like the cap realistically. Is it like \"if u dont grind\" kinda things or is doable to get 9+ in upcoming sems for my level?",

    "The 3rd semester will definitely be harder than your first two semesters, but you can definitely perform well enough to maintain or improve your CGPA. In general, the 2nd year isn't very easy to do well in, the 3rd and 4th semesters are barely tolerable. \n\nIn my experience, along with a lot more reviews from friends, the 3rd year will be a lot easier to manage compared to the previous 2 semesters. Focusing on what's being taught in class and revising the material regularly is more than enough to get a good CGPA imo."
