  "content": "How did you all feel the paper was?  \nFor the people giving this after this certain date:  \n\n\nTHE PAPERS ARE UNPREDICTABLE, what the other people told me about their shifts was way to different in my shift. \n\n  \nPhysics: Physics was FULL of electromagnetism and electrostatics. I'd say maybe 80% exam was full of electrostatics and magnetic effects, electromagnetic induction, properties of electromagnetism.  \n\nChemistry: (Prolly my weakest subject)had equal distribution of physical and organic, YES the inorganic felt pretty less, saw few questions of D-block and of deleted portion mainly (polymers).\n\nMath: I attempted math the last, maybe a mistake, maybe not. All the questions in this subject weren't exactly easy or lengthy or hard. It was a MIXTURE of all the types, I found the paper quite lengthy (ofc i attempted it last) and this part had some of the easiest questions in math (from determinants and matrices) and some of the lengthiest (vectors and 3d distance questions) and few of very good level tough question (differential , integrals and etc)\n\nEnglish: Yes you need to scroll on the comprehension part. Prolly the easiest comprehension ive done till the date. Other synonyms word were quite uncommon but pretty easy you can easily guess them.\n\ni attempted overall 110/180 (not the brightest of all)\n\nHow was your exam? \nhow many did yall attempt?\nDo i have any chances to get into PES?\n\nI gave the exam actually at PES, RR campus the campus was pretty nice ngl. Pretty Neat and cool (the first college i visited in my college hunt).\n\nAll the best to the ppl giving the test after this.",

    "how many guess work u did??i attempted 93 (22 april) shift 2 no guess.\n└── i dont have any exact number, but prolly around 15-18",
    "did u do ncert?\n└── Yeah, during my boards (CBSE). But believe me around 60% questions were WAY ABOVE NCERT level\n    └── So yhe paper is jee lvl? I thought my comedk prep would be enough\n        └── You might get an easier shift. Very unpredictable papers.\n            └── Well harder shifts are better rank wise bcs of the normalisation right?\n                └── I guess. I was not aware about normalisation tho but yeah.",
    " hello!! i have mine on may3rd. can you give me some tips please i am really scared that i might not end up in any good college lol\n├── Just chill !!! Just revise all the concepts in maths and physics tho grind all the formulae and chemistry try remembering the orders and the reactions in organic and physical just try solving many questions! That's all ig. But don't get scared cus very less no of students write pessat and if you perform okayish also you can get seat!\n└── First of all don't be scared. Just chillax. Maintaing the speed in the exam is the only top. Questions selecting is must and maintaining speed. You'll get some pretty easy questions and pretty hard ones aswell. Try understanding the level and attempt accordingly. Be clear with formulas and understand the syllabus and important topics.\n\nAll the best.",
