    "Usually events are open to both campuses, unless explicitly mentioned. If you're curious *where* an event is being organised from, the building names are an easy way to figure it out. BE block, F/Panini, G, GJB are blocks present in RR campus. However some block names like MRD are common to both campuses so you'll need to be careful.\n└── they are open to both campus' but if events are only held in rr then how are we expected to travel from ec to rr they are in opposite directions of bangalore  \nalso whats the main academic building in ec called?( the prison one)\n    ├── That's the Engineering Block ig\n    ├── NICE Road?\n\nits an hour or so if you are a slow driver. I can do about 40minutes each way on my car.\n    └── \"Bird Cage\"",
    "Just see the venue. If it's BE block it's for EC campus. GJB, B block, F block etc. are venues for RR campus. it's that simple.\n├── BE is in RR campus right\n│   └── So whats the one in EC mentioned as\n│       └── engineering block\n└── 🙏missed like 3-4 events\n    └── 🫡🫡"
