    "Pesu easily",
    "I had 6k rank and still took pes. Honestly rvce is pretty hard to get, msrit and bms are also tough to get (though bms has increased seats), so pes through jee mains is the best option for anyone who stands no chance of the above three (only if u can afford it though, financial muscle probably plays a big role in deciding if it's the \"best\" option for you)\n└── is it hard to get scholorship in PES? like comedk colleges are \\~9 lakhs cheaper than PES... so what should I Choose?\n    └── No idea about how hard is it to get a scholarship because college hasn't started for me yet. Regarding other comedk colleges, I don't think at 11k u gonna get even dsce or nie mysore. So it's better to go with pes. If u get a cgpa of 8.5 or 9 (don't remember exactly), ur 40% tuition fees will be relieved",
    "Mera rank 7k hai aur mai PES aiml le rha. PES is goated according to my rank🙏\n└── but comedk colleges are \\~9lakhs cheaper than PES...\n    └── Bhai but in your case, at a rank of 11k, you are not gonna get anything decent. So, pes would be a better investment even with a higher fees.\n        └── I'm getting BMSIT CSE, RVITM CSE, SIT Tumkur CSE, DSCE ECE so PES will be a wise decision or no kyunki unka intake jyada hai like \\~720 CSE core+ 480 CSE AIML and for both campus placement centralised hai so approx. 2400 students ho gyee! and considering comedk is \\~9lakhs cheaper... I'm confused\n            └── rvitm cse has good placement, bmsit has decent placement and good campus, sit i wont recommend for non-KA student\n                └── why not SIT because of language barrier?  and what is the scene of PGs in Bangalore like how much will it cost monthly if I took a single room PG with decent facilities?\n                    └── yes because language barrier and rvitm is better but campus isn't good, bmsit is worth the money imo",
    "stfu and take pes cse no other colleges needed peace u need which u will get in pes cse after studying and little bit enjoying macha\n├── also is it hard to get scholorship in PES?\n│   ├── get above 8.6+ (usually) for 40% refund and 9.4+ (usually) for 50% refund\n│   │   ├──  what is the scene of PGs in Bangalore like how much will it cost monthly if I took a single room PG with decent facilities?\n│   │   ├── are you offered any scholorship by PES?\n│   │   └──  and I heard from a PES senior ki &lt;7.5 CGPA students are placed maximum at 6 lpa?\n│   │       └── Varies to person to person bro but ofc if gpa is low, ctc will be low\n│   └── no idea about scholarship\n└── but through comedk fee is \\~9 lakhs cheaper than PES so i'm in doubt\n    └── then take comedk bro if u are getting any good colleges at 11k\n        └── bhai like I'm getting BMSIT CSE, RVITM CSE, SIT Tumkur CSE, DSCE ECE so PES will be a wise decision or no kyunki unka intake jyada hai like \\~720 CSE core+ 480 CSE AIML and for both campus placement centralised hai so approx. 2400 students ho gyee! and considering comedk is \\~9lakhs cheaper... I'm confused\n            └── **Take SIT Tumkur CSE – the median package is around 8–9 LPA, and about 93% of students are placed. BMSIT CSE is similar in terms of placement but has a very high intake. On the other hand, RVITM CSE is in a completely new campus – there's barely any college life, it feels more like a school. Placements there are average to decent, with the lowest being 3 LPA and the highest going up to 27 LPA, but again, it’s a very new campus.**\n\n**Considering both placements and college life, SIT Tumkur is definitely the better choice. Just go for it, bro!**\n                └── but in PES, if you pay more but also study more, u have a shot at a much better placement\n                    └── i mean might be yes might be no . it all depend on individual\n                        └── is it hard to get scholorship in PES?\n                            └── Yes, it’s definitely tough. And if you’re joining PES thinking *“I’ll just study hard and get a scholarship later”*, that mindset can be risky. Your focus shouldn’t be on the scholarship — it should be crystal clear:  \n**“I don’t care whether I get a scholarship or not, I’m here to learn, study hard, and build projects.”**\n\nIf you stress too much about getting the scholarship, it’ll only add pressure and distract you from what really matters — learning and growing.\n\nSo if you're planning to join PES, **don’t join with the expectation that you’ll recover the fees through scholarships**. Just grind, give it your best.  \nAnd honestly, **if the fees are a big concern for you, there are other great colleges that offer more affordable options** — consider those too.  \n\n\n#  Scholarships After You Join\n\n|Scholarship|Criteria|When?|Benefit|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**MRD**|Top 5% (CGPA)|From 2nd sem onward|50% tuition refund|\n|**CNR Rao**|Next 20% (SGPA)|From 2nd sem onward|40% tuition refund|\n|**Distinction**|SGPA ≥ 7.75|Each semester|Certificate + ₹1,000–₹2,000|\n                                ├── CGPA mantain krna hard hai kyaa bahut? and I heard from a PES senior ki &lt;7.5 CGPA students are placed maximum at 6 lpa?\n                                └── and what is the scene of PGs in Bangalore like how much will it cost monthly if I took a single room PG with decent facilities?"
