These companies seem to be the regular ones that visit PES over the years. \n\nAfter seeing our current terrible placement scenario compared to the previous batch and still unplaced, I am starting to freak tf out. I want to get a good placement after paying so much fees :(",

    "Cisco usually hires via that hackathon, it might be over already  \n  \nVISA will come very late, not so soon, don't worry. It will be many months after all the other big shots come.\n\nWalmart I think 9+ shortlist\n\nPayPal and Juniper not sure if it came for us \n\nNVIDIA has extremely high demand of skills, they either hire 0 or 1 person and go \n\nBro placements just started, why are u feeling sad, so many companies will still come dont worry, it will go on for a year anyway\n├── Curious, any idea whether Juniper still comes as a separate entity for hiring now that the HPE acquisition has gone through and finalized?\n│   └── ooh I think in that case, HPE will come and hire talent then, because for our batch they had come for these roles - \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kacq69dzkwlf1.png?width=1385&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2806fa173353d516df9750ccede32f4d16afb8d\n│       └── Yep your batch’s JD looks like the standard HPE Aruba, Compute and Storage hiring that they’ve done for so many years.\n\nIt might be the case that this year onwards Juniper hiring is done under HPE itself (HPE Juniper), similar to Aruba hiring. \n\nCould be worth looking into for current students. This is only speculation from my end, and I could be completely wrong if HPE has already come and gone.\n│           └── yeah yeah, cool cool 👍\n└── What kind of skills does nvidia look for?\n    └── https://preview.redd.it/8zjecmzyeslf1.png?width=706&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21322213d59ef81d504be573779d833455648c64\n\n\n\nSomething like this - for Software engineering Intern.\n        └── What roles do they come for\n            └── hardware engineering and software engineering - only two\n                └── So what cs/ec/ee uh eligibility\n                    └── yep, that is standard.",
    "slowdown bro even VIT also suffering tho not related to PES but placements all over the colleges are bad ig [https://vit-placements-tracker-btech2026.streamlit.app/](https://vit-placements-tracker-btech2026.streamlit.app/)\n└── bro VIT has almost 3.5x more students placed compared to PES till now and it's all good companies!\n    └── dont worry PES has low batch strength than huge  strength of VIT , so when mass recruitors come PES stats would be better.",
    "Relax, it's still a bit early to start panicking. These type of MNCs usually go to IITs and NITs first. You can expect them to come to PES in Sept or Oct if there are requirements.",
    "Cisco has already sent a mail for summer internship opportunity",
    "do anyone has idea about the MCA current placement scenario?",
    "VISA gave ppo to 5 students this year. I don't know if they will be coming tbh",
    "IBM came in August and september totaling 3 times. But after last years mass hire they wont do the same this year. They already say there overhired last yr(hearing it frm a friend).\n\nPaypal was offcampus and so is Cisco through hackathon.\n\nNvidia comes for intern only and hires very less like 1 or 2. \n\nJuniper came in October but this year they wont come. Theyll come as combined HPE hiring.\n\nWalmart came in september and November. VISA came in October.\n\nUnpopular opinion: In 2025 even though the best month of placement was August due to IBM hiring so much. But many of the best wellknown companies honestly came in Oct(end) to November time ngl.\n\nAlso eventually everyone gets placed. Its all about the time u get. Some maybe late, some early. So dont worry much."
