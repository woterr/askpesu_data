    "* Many people do competitive programming in PESU. Personally I do as well, but I just stick to **LeetCode** and **InterviewBit**. *CodeForces* I dont really explore, because I feel its not necessary for now. \n* There is also a *Competitive Coding Club named THE ALCODING CLUB* In PES university, RR campus.   \n* *Yes, there are multiple people publishing papers and doing great projects.*   \n\n* Achievements of PESU is a long list, you can check it in PESU website only.",
    "None, everyone is busy mugging up books and PPTs, say codeforces there and people will be like huh?\nâ””â”€â”€ Good for us \nColleges top 10 of banaglore  bave good palcments  we can eaaily be top 1% if things go right\n    â””â”€â”€ Yeah thats good until you meet your IITian colleagues and see them being Candidate Masters xD\n        â””â”€â”€ Once you join the industry you'll realise all those rankings are useless. Nobody cares whether you're some Candidate Master or whatever other rank exists. There isn't any bias just because someone is more active on LC/CF/HR lmao. And neither does it matter if they're from IIT or PES. You aren't going to be given extra credit just because you cleared Advanced. \n\nAll that matters is how you perform at your job. The employee with better skills at the job gets recognised and promoted while the person shit at their job will eventually be phased out. And no, better competitive programming skills do not translate to better software engineering and design skills. Sure it helps build aptitude but the goal is to solve real world problems using actual development tools, and most people who force on competitive programming only often write extremely bad code and neither do they have the intuition to solve actual problems or for good software engineering and design.\n            â””â”€â”€ Broo \nI heard finding intervieas is tougher than getting intevriew  so\nYeH it will matter  ðŸ˜…\n                â””â”€â”€ How do you misspell the same word in two different ways in the same sentence ðŸ˜­\n\nAlso that's because the market is shit. The poor market is affecting all colleges, including IITs. Referrals are the way now.\n                    â””â”€â”€ Brooo \n\"Langauge is just medium \"\nWhat matters is that you understoodðŸ˜Š\n\n\nYeah dude i am chad at typos"
