    "Gate smashers was pretty good. That's where I studied TOC(Afll) from.\n\nAfll is one of those subjects where you gotta practice a bit to get good at it. So you should do all the questions given to you by your teacher.\n└── Are the questions in the slides enough atleast for isa?\n    └── I wouldn't suggest you to limit yourself to just a couple of questions per topic. Do at least 4 or 5.\n        ├── what do you mean by this?\n        │   └── It means that in order to get an A or an S, you might wanna practice more by solving a larger number of questions.\n        └── Alright thanks!"
