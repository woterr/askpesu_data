    "Well said .. \nApply revaluation and keep calm ..\nâ””â”€â”€ Pretty sure that's what they want you to do, 200 rupees to see the paper and a thousand to revaluate is insane. I understand they charge money to deter everybody from applying for revaluation but the amounts are way too much.\n    â”œâ”€â”€ I understand.. but is there any alt if they are not done relative grading .. this is the only alt ..\n    â”œâ”€â”€ Meanwhile cries in bmsce , 800 for seeing the paper ,2k for recounting the marks , 6k for challenging an error ðŸ¥²\n    â””â”€â”€ Lmao in bmsce it's 1.5k per credit for evaluation so almost noone applies for re-evaluation",
    "They have taken back the results it's no more showing on the app or website. Though idk if it will remain same or it would change\nâ””â”€â”€ Nope I can still see itðŸ’€\nAm I doomed?",
    "I don't understand why they even have absolute grading in PES with 1000+ students? For a few specific courses, I can understand. But it seems that they have it for majority of the subjects?!\nâ””â”€â”€ chill bro theyre changing something the result has disappeared",
    "Bro we're not mentally unstable chill\nâ””â”€â”€ When were you mentally stable?\n    â””â”€â”€ Since the day I mentally began"
