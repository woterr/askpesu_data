    "Most people don't get a summer internship. It does make things easy if you get one and a PPO through that but it isn't strictly necessary and even okay if you don't bag one. Don't stress over it. \n\nAnd yeah, T1 might not be the easiest but it's not impossible. Try to get it above 8 so that you can at the very least sit for most companies. 8.5+ is ideal though.\n└── I did calculate and I cant get it to 8.5 even with two 10's and its looking very bleak for an 8 too might be around the border or exactly 8 so i might be cooked😔\n    └── No, you're still okay. You might not get placed right away but you should be able to eventually. 8+ is still okay enough, even if it's on the border.",
    "yo i’m in the same exact situation lmao 7.70 on the dot \ni guess we just have to keep it pushing\n└── Yes brother we give it our best and pray everyday\n    └── bless 🙏",
    "Talk to ur teachers, especially those in ur field of interest. they can help loads\n└── Did ask my mentor for one in my last summer the company never contacted me💀. (Did end up in a Research Center at PES so I didn't really mind)\n    └── You have to go personally\n        └── That's exactly what I did but it does depend on the company that's contacting sometimes I suppose",
    "u can get into a border line t1 company (pays u around 12lpa). I have a friend of mine who got placed in consecure with a cgpa of 7.8 recently and i know a lot of them getting 10-11 lpa companies with cgpa around 7 and above. Since u say u can solve medium to high level dsa q's cracking the coding round would be easy. if not u can use ai to get ur answers and try to make sure u have a good resume as they usually shortlist based on it and shld be able to explain the projects in the interview round .If ur aiming for high t1 companies then u'll have to improve ur gpa to 8.5+.\n└── Ohh okay makes sense thank you",
    "T1 cutoff will be mostly 8.5 , it will be lil bit difficult for summer T1 internships\n└── For summer I dont mind interning at any company as long as they pay good. Im just worried about T1 placements tbh😭\n    └── Dw bruh!\nYou are doing great by having 8 CGPA at 6 th sem ,\n\nYou do have a lot of scope to get placed in a T1 Company , you just have to concentrate on building skills which is very much imp to placement’s !!\n\n\nSo yea ATB :)\n        └── Hopefully I get it up to 8😭"
