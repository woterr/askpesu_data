  "content": "Hi, So I am in my 7th sem now. My cgpa is 7.15 \n\nI am pretty decent at DSA, system design, fullstack , all core concepts. I have done 1 internship like a decent one, I also have 2-3 good projects. \n\nIs it possible for me to get a placement in tier 1 company. How hard is it? And in placement sheets some places cutoff cgpa is not mentioned , does that mean the company dosent put cgpa criteira.\n\nAlso tell me about off-campus and referrals\n\n",

    "How did you got internship\nâ””â”€â”€ I got it via referral",
    "yes, its possible to get Tier 1 company, Keep applying via placements and so on once it starts. I believe it starts on August 4 for your batch. \n\nyes, if its not mentioned in placement sheet, the CGPA criteria wasnt there so anyone could apply.\n\n  \nwhat do you want to know about off campus and referrals? Basically there is a lot of competition perhaps outside and right now fresher job market is very bad, and as for referrals they work sometimes and sometimes not, no guarantee really dude.\nâ””â”€â”€ Thanks a lot, I actually lost hopes on campus placements. Maybe its high time for me to work harder and set things up right\n    â””â”€â”€ why are you losing hopes before it has even started?",
