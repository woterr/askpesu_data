    "its dogshit every site is blocked cant even use spotify unless u got an real vpn you cant bypass that  \nmobile hotspot works but depending on your hostel block and floor it may or maynot work\nâ””â”€â”€ Which sites are blocked ? Give some examples\n    â””â”€â”€ Anything flagged entertainment is usually blocked by pesu wifi\n        â””â”€â”€ Even YouTube ?\n            â””â”€â”€ Nah youtube,reddit,twitter,insta these are allowed \nUse cloudwarp vpn to access all sites \nI used that only\n                â””â”€â”€ Ok thanks",
    "You can use ur personal hotspot(the internet might be slow depending on ur room) or just use a vpn to bypass.\nCloudfare warp used to work for me till last year but it stopped working now, rn I'm using urban vpn and it works fine.\n\nEdit: you cant play games tho, even if you use vpn. It shows low ping but jitters a lot(atleast for valo it did)\nâ””â”€â”€ What can you do with hostel wifi then ? ðŸ˜­\n    â””â”€â”€ Without vpn only the basic social media, and some of the pirated sites are also unblocked i think. With vpn, you can use anything so without vpn it would be hard. But yeah vpn sometimes reduces the speed a lot so it becomes hard when th3 speed is low. But if you have 5g it shd be fine ryt, it mostly works everywhere\n        â””â”€â”€ Can you like use steam, epic games store or is it too much to ask ?\n            â””â”€â”€ With the vpn you can browse the store,  but playing fps games is hard. You can prolly play story games"
