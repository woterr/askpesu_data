  "content": "Hi, I'm currently in my 4th sem- AIML and I'm not sure whether to do an internship at the college during the holidays or focus on practicing aptitude/DSA or even learn Java since Iâ€™ve heard that C and Python wonâ€™t be very helpful.. especially for interviews... I asked a couple of people about this and got a variety of answers. Some advised me to do internships outside the college rather than the ones offered within but I feel like I donâ€™t have the skills to apply anywhere except for the ones in college. Others suggested that I should focus on improving my skills first. I'm just really confused and donâ€™t know what to do...",

    "Hey! Just a small suggestion try doing an internship on campus. Itâ€™s a great way to get some real experience. There are some pretty cool research centers like ISFCR, IOT, CDSAML, CCBD, PIL, Cave Labs, etc., where you can apply.\n\nJust a heads-up donâ€™t join Rapid, itâ€™s kinda meh ðŸ’€\n\nInternships are usually around 6 weeks, so while youâ€™re at it, maybe start brushing up on DSA or dive into full stack stuff (Next.js is a solid choice). You could also build some fun mini projects on the side.\n\nAnd trust me, the internship wonâ€™t go to waste. It seriously adds value to your resume and LinkedIn, and gives you experience working in team.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Can you please elaborate on rapid\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Last year the mentors were worstt,   \nIf you are applying for RAPID, apply if your guide is BJD sir\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ What is the sir's full name.\nâ”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ Bhaskarjyoti Das\nâ”‚           â””â”€â”€ Check his profile most of the team who worked under him got best Capstone project awards.\nâ””â”€â”€ I applied for ISFCR (AI for Cyber Security), CCBD &amp; CDSAML, RAPID, C3I(The Center for Cognitive Computing and Computational Intelligence). Which one would be better among these??\n    â””â”€â”€ InÂ **CCBD**,Â **CDSAML**, andÂ **ISFCR**, youâ€™ll be expected to build a project, write a research paper on it, and aim to publish it either in a conference or a journal.  \nYou will get the credits when you publish the paper or else 2 credits goneee.\n\nForÂ **CCBD**Â andÂ **CDSAML**, most of my friends were given problem statements like improving an existing model or codebase. Usually, theyâ€™ll hand you a paper and ask you to enhance itâ€”like improving accuracy or performance. The themes are mostly aroundÂ **LLMs, NLP, sentiment analysis, deep learning, reinforcement learning**, etc.\n\nHonestly, we already do similar stuff for our ML projects. These days, coding from scratch isnâ€™t the norm vibe coding is trending (not the best practice, but yeah, thatâ€™s the reality for ML). Writing everything from the ground up can be pretty intense.\n\nIf youâ€™re genuinely interested inÂ **pure ML, DL**, or similar areas, these centres might be a great fit.\n\nBut if youâ€™re leaning more towardsÂ **security**, thenÂ **ISFCR**Â could be a better match. They focus onÂ **security principles**and offer problem statements like:\n\n* How to protect user data and networks\n* Finding vulnerabilities in LLMs\n* Integrating ML for enhanced security\n\nYouâ€™ll also get some exposure toÂ **networking and OS concepts**Â (though not super deep into OS).\n\nAt the end of the day, itâ€™s totally your choice â€™m just giving you the info so you can decide better. Hope this helped and you got the clarity\n        â””â”€â”€ Thank you soo muchh for helping me out!!",
    "Dont companies come for internships in the 6th sem?\nâ””â”€â”€ Yesss companies do come for internship in 6th Sem.\n    â””â”€â”€ Have a doubt.. what if someone accepts a PPO off campus after 6th sem internship... is he/she allowed to sit for placements in the 7th sem ?\n        â””â”€â”€ No"
