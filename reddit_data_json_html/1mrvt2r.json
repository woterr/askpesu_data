    "Grind Striver's A to Z sheet properly and contests everyday. It would be the same during placements, crazy hard OAs..\nâ””â”€â”€ Contests from codeforces? Also how many people got an internship (in campus) in third year from your batch?\n    â”œâ”€â”€ Codeforces would be the upper limit, you can do LC, AtCoder contests n all.   \n  \nFor internships on campus, it would be around 45-50 out of 1200-1300 eligible CSE+AIML students\n    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Damn what? So less? How do the others get an internship then? Referrals or something?\n    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Yeah, the total number of students who did an internship this summer would be around 300 tho. Mostly through connections and referral.\n    â””â”€â”€ Tbh you don't need to grind dsa that much.\n\nOne year of thorough dsa should be enough.\n\nYou also need to grind concepts that may be asked in interviews.\n        â””â”€â”€ Yeah true one of my friend got placed in Net Core recently. We both are from ECE and she has done minors in CSE. She said the interviewer also helps sometimes. But what about us core ECE man.. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­"
