    "you don't have to bring it a lot during the first year- just in the c/python classes if the teacher allows it- for other subjects, just occasionally, to complete an assignment or some presentation, which again depends on the teacher.\n\nEDIT: specifications : sufficient 16GB RAM, 512gb SSD / 256gb SSD, preferably light weight with a long battery life\nâ”œâ”€â”€ bhaiya a question doe, will we get some kind of charging ports in classroom? cuz my laptop gets emptied in about 2 hours(more or less)\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ You have charging ports in classrooms. Also, you don't have to call people bhaiya here. Just call by names\nâ”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Got it!! thank youuu\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Yes\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Then get MacBook \n14 hour battery life man \nThe best thing I bought in my life itâ€™s still running and no lag\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ spent all the money trying to pay the absurd tuition fees ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Is 16gb ram necessary? Won't 8gb be enough?\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Get 16gb bro\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€  you'll need to use it to build projects, complete course work etc- so, to be on the safer side, 16GB RAM is advised\nâ””â”€â”€ do i need a graphic card like NVIDIA\n    â”œâ”€â”€ Depends what you wanna do but I'd say not really.\n    â”œâ”€â”€ only for gaming  \nmost ml stuff you do on cloud anyway\n    â””â”€â”€ Yeahhh you need",
    "joining ec cse as well, I am toh bringing a normal laptop which can handle moderate amount of task",
    "I guess it would be better if you buy one after joining the college as you then get a student discount.",
    "Get a macbook and stay in peace for 4 years\nâ””â”€â”€ For realllll\nMacBook are the best \nThe silent ones and the most reliable \nI have few friends who have windows yearly they get issues with wifi card or SSD\n    â””â”€â”€ Ya even i bought omen and in one year it has some display issue",
    "Get a macbook , if budget doesn't allow buy a good quality windows laptop , (thinkpads , yoga and other equivalents).\nDon't buy a gaming laptop, almost everyone has it and everyone I've talked to is just annoyed by dealing with it , they are bulky , fragile , shit battery and you won't be doing much gaming in pes  (light and indie games can be handled by non gaming laptops)\nâ””â”€â”€ A dedicated gpu isn't required ryt?\nI thought of buying a ThinkBook.\n    â””â”€â”€ No , the entire course can be done on a 10+ year old laptop running linux , there's only one elective Ar vr or something where gpu is needed for unity , thinkpads are better built than thinkbooks but check for urself before buying"
