  "content": "Hi, Im joining pes university through management quota (cse), yes my father paid almost 48 lakhs for just a mere btech degree, but I promised him that I would return all the money after I start earning (i am really feeling guilty af 😭, I told him several times that I would be better in tier 3, but he doesn’t trust me anymore😔)\n\nI wanted to ask that will I be treated ill if I disclose in college that I am a mqt student or should I just lie. Also I got 91 percentile in jee mains, so would I be able to survive in this college ?",

    "Lmao I was in the same situation several years ago. I didn’t even attempt jee and felt a little guilty about my parents paying for management quota. Now that I’ve graduated, I don’t have any regrets though.\n\nRelax, no one asks or cares if you got admission through mq.\n├── Thank you so much 🙏\n└── How long will it take to pay if off",
    "why didnt you just go to the USA for btech then lol\n├── How tf do u get 91 percentile in jee without cracking kcet or pessat\n│   └── I f’ed up my pessat thinking there were no negative marking, also there were no instructions before the exams, so I was pretty confused 😭😭\n│       └── there were instructions.\n└── Im the only child of my parents and they wont be able to see me frequently",
    "**Self realisation is important,** now that you have crossed that hurdle.  \n**My honest suggestion to you would be to take a drop and try for JEE/BITS next year.**\n\n**No B-Tech Degree in India (including tier-1 colleges) is worth spending 48L.**   \n  \nI repeat, no B-Tech Degree in India is worth spending 48L, irrespective of how rich your father is, it is not a good decision to spend this much money for degree from a tier-2 college.\n\nTaking a drop and committing yourself for hardwork to get into a tier 1 college next year will give you far better ROI than this.\n\nIn tier 1 college you will get:\n\n* Good peer group\n* Good Alumni network, which will be accessible throughout your career\n* Comparatively better Placements (with same level of performance that you can do in tier-2 college)\n* Access to better Faculty and better infrastructure\n└── This is 100% true\n\nBut it’s a bit too late now\n\nIf he wanted to take a drop, he should’ve been on it alrwady by now\n\nIt’s September in few days and exam is literally in 3 months. Also I know 3 months is more than enough. But I’m assuming OP stopped preparing JEE related stuff at-least 3-4 months back and to even get back to same level, it will take 1.5 month\n    └── Its 4 months (Sep to Dec) as exam will be in Jan.  \nAnd for JEE main 2 and BITSAT, there is ample time.",
    "As long as your father doesn't have any financial burdens after this huge expenditure. Then not to worry!\n└── Actually he told me the same, that I don’t need to worry about the fees, but I really have this huge guilt that I wasn’t been able to take admission through merit",
    "Just 48 ?\nNo donations?\nI'm just asking out of curiosity \n├── Isn’t it 48 itself? Or is it more?\n└── From what I’ve heard, for CSE it’s 12L and EEE it’s like 5L per year or something. They don’t take anything else it seems.\n    └── yeah PES is quite legit in this matter, BMS and all take lots backdoor entries and stuff.",
    "🤡🤡\n├── Bro tbh my jee mains percentile was not even 80 percentile but I have been doing decent enough  in this college though I got the my seat through Pessat quota..\n└── I also got 6k rank in pessat, but didnt want mech, any tips?\n    └── Bro no one cares if your mq or not\nNow everything is on you how you study :)\n        └── Just wanted to know that would I be able to survive ?\nI already completed web dev (html, css, javascript till arrays), completed C programming, started c++, and also doing basic differentiation, integration, differential equations for eng mathematics\n            ├── Now if I tell that you won’t be able to survive, what will you do?

    "lol i got 40&gt; percentile in jee and ended up in pes rr ece through pessat\n├── 9XXXX in cet btw\n└── Bro will they allow management quota I had already paid the fees I am gonna get 75% in pcm but the requirements for it was 80% will I get it or what ???
