  "content": "So, I will be joining PES RR campus CSE Department this year, I have few doubts which is in-common with my friends as well who are joining PES....\n\n1. Is there a locker facility available??\n\n2. What is the fee for Gym, is it free or paid (How much?)??\n\n3. Canteen lunch (mess) plans something like that, how much will they charge, and rate the food (cleanliness, taste, etc)\n\n4. Seniors advise how to manage and do well in 1st year as I am taking partial drop for IITs too (don't wanna have any regrets as it will be my last try so)....\n\n5. Till what time can students stay on campus in the study area??\n\n6. How are the profs?? Will I be able to get proxies and also can I sit in the last bench and prep (only in 1st year ofc) for JEE??\n\n7. Apart from KCET fees, what are the other expenses and total??\n\n8. When can we expect for the university to open for freshers 28' ??",

    "Gym is great , it's around 10k for an academic year ( like 10 months , excluding the 2 months holidays )\n\nCanteen is good, the food that u pay for at the food court is great. Not sure about hostel messes as I haven't checked it out yet , but Namdhahari and Food court are still known to be decent messes.",
