    "Pes CS 10lac plus 12lac yearly fee \nEC 7lac plus 7lac yearly fee\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Wait so basically to get a MQ CSE seat at RR, it's 12*4 + 10 = 58L? \n\nHoly shit how do people justify paying ~60L for an undergrad degree from PES? I paid 12.8L in total a few years ago for a PESSAT CS seat and we used to discuss how expensive it was.\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Tbf it's not for middle class PPL. all the people who go to pes by management quota are very rich\nâ”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Yeah I have friends from various parts of the country that joined through MQ, they're all loaded as fuck. I don't think the higher fee is a cause of concern for them.\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ They can justify it because there arenâ€™t many alternatives. PES and RVCE are basically the only good colleges in India for engineering that offer admission through management quota.\n\nRVâ€™s management quota is even more expensive\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ Do you know how much a CS seat costs at RVCE, BMS and MSRIT? Just trying to get an estimate for comparison, even approx figures will do\nâ”‚           â””â”€â”€ BMS -\nCS 56.5lac overall package. 16.5lac donation.\n\nRamaiah -\nCS 48.5lac donation 274000/- yearly fee \nEC 16lac donation 274000 yearly fee\n\nRV college -\nCS 32lac DD plus 6.5lac first year fees, 12lac from second year\n\nEC 16lack DD  plus 5lack first year\nSecond year 7 lac\nâ”‚               â””â”€â”€ The fees for RVCE CSE through management is 68 lacs it's mentioned on their own website man\nâ”‚                   â”œâ”€â”€ Ya it depends on the number of seats available. They increase the price drastically with amount of seats\nâ”‚                   â””â”€â”€ Bro they have development fees also.\nâ””â”€â”€ Wait they started taking donations now?ðŸ’€\n    â””â”€â”€ Yes they always did . They change the name of donation to development fees",
    "I got in thru MQ and rn in 2nd sem â€¦when i got in last year i had to pay 11 L yearly fee and no extra donations besides that â€¦11L for Cs and aiml peeps , for Ec it was around 7L prolly and also u might not get any seats in Cs if you go now coz of the demands â€¦coz i myself got in before my cet results came out and i only got a seat in aiml at the last moment lolâ€¦â€¦ (advice: after spending a year in this cllg, id recommend anyoneâ€™s whoâ€™s thinking abt getting in thru MQ to think over once again, get in only if youâ€™re ready to bust your ass studying and working hard coz the exams,tests, and their tight schedules isnt a piece of cake for everyone and plus invest only if you r truly passionate abt the subject else its a waste of money and time)",
    "Would highly recommend not joining via management quota. The fees isn't worth it.",
    "It's not worth it dude"
