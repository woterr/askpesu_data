Does that mean I’ll get to know what branch I’ve been allotted on June 7th itself or I just get to choose what branches to put in my preference list?\n\n Asking because I have to pay for manipal counselling too, but I’m not sure I’ll get cse there. So I don’t want to waste 10k for a branch I don’t want. ",
