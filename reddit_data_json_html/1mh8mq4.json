    "What is summer term? Nd is it also for 2 credits?",
    "It's correct, the first 2 sem are 22 credits only,\n2- 5 credit, 2- 4 credit, 1- 3 credit, 1- 1 credit\n└── For 24-28 batch the first 2 sems were for 24 credits each\n    └── If it was then the credits will be adjusted to special topics in any of the sem",
    "Likely a mistake because result also says 24 credits each for 1st two sems"
