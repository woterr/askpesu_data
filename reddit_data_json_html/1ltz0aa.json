    "Math 2 might have pakka had relative or i wouldn't have gotten an S (prolly by 2-3 marks)\n\nMech might have had by like 2-3 marks..  But again this is just a speculation coz I had a final isa of 45, and in esa i left off 20 marks like didn't even attend and might have lost 10 more marks in numerical questions (coz ik i didn't get the right answer for 3 questions) and might have lost 3-4 marks in theory, but still got an A grade\n\nRest EPD,C,CHEM didn't have relative not even a mark for sure..\n└── I see thank you"
