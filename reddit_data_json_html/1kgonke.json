    "No they are not. I wanna know who sold them our email ids. I just can't seem to get rid of them\n├── No one would have sold it, since it's PES email there is an pattern and once they figure it they can get the email of everyone. Also the mail just mentions Pes student not ur actual name\n│   └── Pretty easy to get the actual names too https://github.com/anuragrao04/get-pes-people\n│       └── Thought I'd leave a suggestion on your repo but decided to do it here anyway: \n\nYou don't need to manually generate a CSRF token and update an .env file. You can do it programmatically, the same way you've used the CSRF to access the endpoint. So you can effectively make the entire pipeline autonomous. \n\nIf you want a code example, check PESUAuth's repo. It contains a function that does the entire thing: https://github.com/HackerSpace-PESU/pesu-auth\n\nOr even better, you can use (and maybe contribute?) to this currently unmaintained project: https://github.com/HackerSpace-PESU/pesuacademy-py\n\nWhile the former is simply to fetch credentials (the same system that authenticates users on the discord server), the latter is more extensive and serves as a Python wrapper over PESU Academy. The know your class and section snippet is present across both the repos I shared.\n└── since our email IDs are in the `srn@pesu.pes.edu` format, it's easy to just iterate over all possible SRNs and generate a mailing list. I'm not saying PES is a saint but there are easier ways to get at our emails than striking a deal with PES.",
