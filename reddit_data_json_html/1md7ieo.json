  "content": "I have already seen posts about curfew timings but they had all stated 9 but at the hostel briefing session, I was told that the hostel timings for the boys hostel were 7:30 only and that we'd receive 10 deviation points or something like that and a 100 of those would get us kicked out? I understand the gym and sports facilities closing by then but they mentioned that we'd need to be in the hostel, in our rooms by 7:30. Isn't that a little too early?",

    "Attendance starts at 9 and ends at 10 so you must be in before 10 that's all\n└── so they won't penalize if we aren't in by 7:30 right? no deviation points or whatever?\n    ├── Nah, u will understand the vibe when u join dw\n    │   └── Oh okay got it\n    └── dont worry for any deviations points . only thing is just dont get caught staying in others room till very late night or playing in corridor ,thats it and offcourse no smoking or drugs.\n        └── Alright got it just as long as I can stay out till 9 I'm fine\n            └── *10",
    "When Briefing session happened?\nI also registered for hostel in rr campus and I am in ece branch. They didn't call me for briefing session why ?",
    "I think the unwritten rule for RR boys hostel is like you can't go out after 9pm, but you can come in till 10pm."
