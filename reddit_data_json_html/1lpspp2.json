    "MIT BLR should not be an option for *any* branch right now. It's not had a single placement cycle yet. You guys will be the 4th batch to graduate, a very high level of risk.\n└── You're wrong.\n    └── Why\n        └── The 4th batch has already graduated and the college has had a decent placement cycle.\n            ├── Do you have info about the placement? Avg and median and shit\n            └── That gives people exactly 1 data point to go by, compared to PES. I am not even going to go into the details of how that 1 data point is not enough to conclude anything.\n                └── Doesn't change the fact that you were wrong\n                    └── Fair, but my point about not having enough data to go by still stands.\n                        └── I have never stated otherwise 👍",
