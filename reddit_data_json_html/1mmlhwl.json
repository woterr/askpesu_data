    "Absolutely not\n\nRR and EC PESU are the same college - PES University \n\nPlease don't fall for such things on other subs\nâ””â”€â”€ They said that ec students must wait for the completion of placement in rr campus then they can attend the placements....\n    â”œâ”€â”€ nothing like this, pes has combined placements they donâ€™t declare which student is from which campus they donâ€™t even have this in their database so both the campuses get same opportunities\n    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Oh ok..\n    â”œâ”€â”€ There's nothing like this lmao some of my friends have even been shortlisted for interviews (unfortunately they weren't selected)\n    â””â”€â”€ Ppl in other subs have built misconceptions about both campuses prolly considering KCET or JEE cutoffs at both.Dw about that.Placements are centralized. It was different when PES ECC was under VTU. So you ain't missing out on much.If you f-ck up, you're f--ked regardless of your campus lol. Doesn't matter whether you're in RR or ECC.",
    "Who tf compares PES with SJCE dawg ðŸ¥€ðŸ¥€\nâ””â”€â”€ In Mysore everyone does sadly ðŸ¥€ðŸ¥€",
