    "You can cover the syllabus in one week. Block all apps for a week, no social life and just study. I've started like 2 days before isa started also and got pretty good marks.\n\nDon't just read from slides, make notes in a way you understand so it's easy to revise. Practise solving problems from mcqs and qb.\n\nYou'll be fine!\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Thanks for the hopium",
