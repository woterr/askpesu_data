  "title": "[Question]struggling to focus and build something meaningful",
  "content": "I recently wrapped up a 2-month internship(in college), and honestly, it didn’t live up to my expectations. The first couple of weeks were somewhat insightful, but after that, the learning curve just plateaued, and I found myself not gaining much from the experience.\n\nNow that it’s over, I’m feeling stuck and unsure of how to move forward. I really want to upskill and build something worthwhile, but I have this habit of jumping between domains — one day I’m into full-stack, the next it’s machine learning, and then I’ll suddenly want to dive into Android dev. This constant switching leaves me overwhelmed and ends up with me doing... well, nothing meaningful.\n\nI know having a solid project on my resume can really make a difference, but I don’t know where to start or what to stick with.\n\nIf any of you have been in a similar boat or have advice on how to pick a path, stay consistent, or choose a project that actually helps with learning and career growth, I’d genuinely appreciate it.\n\nThanks in advance!",
