    "https://imgur.com/a/5pHf9Td\nâ””â”€â”€ When was this notice posted?\n    â””â”€â”€ Last year I suppose\n        â””â”€â”€ After kcet admissions got over or before\nI would be glad if someone leaks cutoff for this year lol\n            â””â”€â”€ Afaik, cutoffs depend on the last year's last person joining rank i believe, so you'd basically have to ask everyone who joined via KCET their ranks ðŸ’€\n                â””â”€â”€ Nah its the other way around  the cutoff decides the last person who joins\n                    â””â”€â”€ For PESSAT the \"cutoff\" is the rank of the last person who joined. AFAIK it should be the same for KCET too.",
