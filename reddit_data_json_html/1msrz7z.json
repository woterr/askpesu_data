    "Wait so. U don't get scholarship after 6th sem ?? \nBut anyways ig it's better if you wait till u pass out cause it ain't gonna do now harm keeping it as is for the next few months.\n└── yes, there is no scholarship after 6th sem",
    "If you're TA-ing then you'll get your stipend through Union Bank. (Sem 7 TAs get it sometime in Sem 8) Otherwise no more payments from college.\n├── Oh alright, thanks a lot! I am a TA for Big Data so guess im keeping it open\n└── If you dont mind , how much will they pay for TAs? like is it per hour or fixed for sem."
