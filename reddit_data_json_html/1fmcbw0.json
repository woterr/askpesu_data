    "Your friend didnâ€™t give you the right facts. The classes begin from 23 ,which is tomorrow, and the teachers didnâ€™t start teaching anything\n\nAnyway, Iâ€™m sure you knew from the first that KCET batch will be rushed so Iâ€™m not sure why you suddenly feel *cooked*\n\nRememberâ€¦ your class will begin with other KCET batch students. So whatever problem youâ€™re facing will be faced by others as well. So relax\n\nAll the best",
