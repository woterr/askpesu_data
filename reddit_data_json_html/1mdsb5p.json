  "content": "I am from rr cse and have a cgpa of above 7 and I have wasted the last two years just reading pesu slides and passing exams, I am aiming for placements and I got to know that the important topics are dsa+daa, os, cn and dbms + otherthings you guys can share if you know. Can you suggest some good resources where one can cover these topics upto the expectation of the companies(bcoz pesu teachers themselves tell to explore beyond their own syllabus) . I know they have shared textbooks as well, but i have never read them properly and i dont have to time to do that as well. Apart from that what sort of projects should we do for the interviewers to think we are good enough for the internship/job. Also could any seniors share their struggle who were in a similar condition as me and made it through.",

    "Try leetcode do some 250 blind question and then some basics of SQL cmds and try System Designs,  \nif u do this u will be on top 20% , it can take 6-10 months to for this , it does depend on your your knowledge on DSA and OS , CN basics are very important i don't know much about AWS part\n\nResource Leetcode is like an GoldMine u will get most of the things (DSA , DBMS, System Design )   \n  \nwell these are the most important things"
