    "what's your kcet rank",
    "Try KEA counselling. You should get some good colleges for ECE. And the fees in kea will be around 1.2 lakh per year. \n\nYou may get ECE in EC campus with PES KCET rank. But fees is higher 4.5 lakhs. \nCheck the mock round of kea to know what colleges u have chance to get. \nAnd decide later to attend Pesu kcet counselling or not?. "
