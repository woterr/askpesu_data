    "1. Ye u need to pay extra 10000 to avail scholarships. There is no scholarship in final year\n└── Complete ripoff\n    └── Tbf everyone gets 9.5+ in the final year unless you've put in absolutely zero effort. The point of a meritorious award disappears when at least 50 kids get a 10 GPA\n        └── yeah but my point is why do we have to pay 10,000 to avail scholarship when there is no scholarship\n            └── That's a good catch. I guess another dark strategy to make profits lol\n                └── what if we don't . i mean you can skip that right? i heard they won't let you skip once you paid the extra 10000 in first year\n                    ├── Can't comment. My batch didn't have to pay to be eligible for scholarships\n                    │   └── So when did they start it??\n                    │       └── I think it was 2 years ago.\n                    └── Yes that's correct\nBut if u opt out from scholarships from sem2, you can never avail them during ur entire course again\n                        └── Nope. It's a scam\n                            └── Wait I can avail the scholarship in my 2nd year?\n                                └── yeah. first confirm it with the accounts department"
