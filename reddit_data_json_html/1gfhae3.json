    "Pesuacademy will automatically block you from registering for ESAs for subjects where your attendance is &lt;75% (not sure if this actually true but this is what I've heard most teachers say).\n\nDon't bunk any more classes.",
    "Get ready to write letters, run around teachers and the COE office..",
    "Adding to the other answers here: \n\nNot enough attendance = not allowed to write the ESA\n\nNo ESA = automatically fail the course, even if you score 40/40 in ISAs and get a perfect score on the assignment/projects. \n\nFailing the course = backlog\n└── so i’ll be pushed to next semester but i’ll have to clear the backlogs in next semester right? i won’t be held back like they do in schools and repeat one more year?\n    └── Check the FAQs for a more detailed answer but yes, you can be held back a year if you have more than 24(?) credits in backlog.",
    "Just refer to this. It will help you know how many can you bunk at max. Each class means 45 mins\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0z2pk34v0vxd1.jpeg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=402386c818e81faa746196c85092eaf9c14908f9\n└── You should join Ferrari as their team principal 😂.master🅱️lan"
