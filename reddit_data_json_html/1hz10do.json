  "content": "I have messed up real bad in M1 and I May fuck up M2, My core mathematics is very weak, specially calculus topics which are necessary and I prefer getting taught face to face. If I'm being honest, I would just blindly stare at the board when maths is taught, Cuz for real I don't know shit.   \nI can try reaching out to faculty but I need someone on me f2f, cuz i know i cant otherwise",
