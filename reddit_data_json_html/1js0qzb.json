    "Why is it called comedy nite if it's in the middle of the day\nâ”œâ”€â”€ That's the comedy lol\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Hot damm\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ ðŸ˜­\nâ””â”€â”€ Well, until 2 ATs ago, Comedy Nite was Saturday night, the concert was Sunday night and you could buy tickets separately from day 1. \n\nBeginning last year, both are on the same day.\n    â””â”€â”€ Yeah back when even I was in college, they were on separate days and had separate tickets. And yes, both happened at night. Not sure why they changed.",
