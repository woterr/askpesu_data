    "Feel free to reach out to anyone on LinkedIn, although do it politely.\n└── Can you please tell me a proper way to start a convo, I get really awkward when asking questions.\n    └── Depends on what you're asking. \n\nThis is usually what I say: \n\nHi, I'm X, your junior from PES University batch of YYYY. I hope you're doing well. \n\nI wanted to reach out to you to find out about...\n\nThanks,\nX\n        ├── But what if I say\n\nYo\nIt's me\nYour junior\n\nCan you help me out?\n\nWould you reply 👉👈\n        ├── What if its about refferal 😂😂\n        │   └── Then, you should be (less) more professional 😂😂\n        └── Thank you so much man ♥️",

    "💯 \nSeniors are more than happy to help, everyone gets a nice nostalgic feel when someone from the college reaches out.\n\nI wrote about it a while ago,\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/s/vNbWkTk4t0\n\nSince then, I have worked with 5-6 juniors, 4 of which are active and they have done a phenomenal job. I know a couple who reached out, those in 1-2-3rd years wanted guidance with academics conference research and they are doing extremely well. I got a research assistantship in my own university and that's going to put him on top of the applications for university and scholarship.\nA few who wanted to connect to industry I connect them to my friends who I knew were entering their own startup, were senior position holders and doing project management (a lot of people in PES want that role and experience, it surprised me) and this extends to even further, I did my UG from PES but my PhD from an IIM, I got one connected to my IIM Batchmate and the junior got a PPO and the friend got a bit referal (and I got a Zomato delivery 😂of meghana).\n\nBe formal, and reasonable (they will help but you are not demanding) all your seniors will be glad to help some even will go out of their way to help cause it' feels as a responsibility being an alum. \n\nI know a lot of my batchmates, almost all of them who were \"critical\" to say the least about the college process and the ridiculous rules but they always have sympathy for fellow sufferers. Heck I have to ask my own kin to take PES cause I know while it might not be most student friendly it has got its network.\n\nMain thing, \nFor referrals for jobs and internships,\nThe conversion rates are pretty low cause even they can't do much. However to help them make your case\n1. Give a good detail of your CV, GitHub, Kaggle etc accounts where you have kept your work. \n2. Write a one page SOP (I never did it myself but it might just be the only thing they read), telling about what you want and more importantly why you are a good candidate , it helps them put your case forward or just forward the mail with sop to the recruitment team.\n\nFinally and I can't push this enough,\nPESU rules, project and internship credits, vacation norms and all those have changed drastically.\nYour seniors (those who can really help) didn't have most of these flexible rules both the RR campus ones and specially the EC Campus one (they were under VTU, 10-5 days holidays in a year)\nSo make sure you clearly mention that you can take a long time break, you will have the flexibility to work, that you are available for more than 2 months. \n\n\nAll the very best 🙌",
    "YES PLEASE! ALWAYS! Never hesitate to reach out to anyone,  out of 5 at least 2 will help you out",
    "Ofc",
    "It's not just fine, I think it's necessary. It's an awesome way to get access to opportunities and knowledge, because we seniors/alumni are well aware of the struggles and cluelessness we faced as juniors."
