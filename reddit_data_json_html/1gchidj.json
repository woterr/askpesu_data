  "content": "So im a hosteller ( boys hostel)  at PES rr and I want to know if there's any places I can attend meetings ( video )  or calls from ( I need a table and chair and preferably a quiet place) On Saturdays and Sundays. The library is closed on Sunday and on Sat it closes by 5pm , I think GJBC is somewhat empty so I usually go there but there's no proper study rooms on weekends that I can find and this is considering I don't want to attend from my room. Are there any other 'study rooms' or classes or spots available on weekends till like 8pm or sum",
