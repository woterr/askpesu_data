    "To join pes there are 4 options.\n\n1.\t⁠⁠Government seats (40%): This is through KCET counselling only and the fee structure is according to KCET 2025 .\n2.\t⁠⁠JEE mains quota : You can join through this if ur jee mains percentile is high enough .( not sure about how much u need cuz it’s the first year of admissions held this way ) The fees will be 5L for cs related , 4.5 for ece and 4 for other branches (per year fees)\n3.\t⁠⁠KCET quota : if ur KCET rank is high enough can get through this ….This option mainly people will use if their rank is not high enough to get through KCET counselling but is still a decent rank , fees is similar to jee mains quota.\n4.\t⁠⁠Management quota (15% seats): self explanatory …highest amount of fees ,not sure how much tho.\n\nJee mains and KCET quota combined have 45% seats . If u are sure u are getting pes through the KCET counselling u can still participate in the pes counselling and get a seat there and block it just for safey and wait until the KCET counselling finishes ….then u can get the refund of the blocked seat and join through KCET counselling which will have lower fees.Similar strategy if u have not done well in KCET but have decent mains score.\n└── That clarifies it , Thank you \n    └── Yea but the question remains how are they gonna give seats to people through pesu KCET cousenlling …..cuz they can’t give the 40% government seats as only kea can give em through KCET counselling…..and now through pesu jee counselling almost all seats are over so no idea what is remaining for pesu KCET quota\n        ├── exactly\n        ├── 😐😐\n        └── KCET seats are different the total number which they have displayed during counseling are only JEE seats",
    "Great question…confused as hell\n└── Yeah , mere bhi sarr ke uper se gya ye sawaal , \n\n\nJee mains has 45% seats , and for people going through jee+kcet are also allotted through these 45 only , he wanted to ask if out of these 324 (45%) seats through kcet+comedk half ie 162 belong to csab \n\n\nIdk what I'm saying atp ",
    "Yea I thought about this after I got the seat....since my friend didn't get one through mains.\nMy dad did some research on the main website too..and im 90% sure that only the remaining seats (in EC campus or mechanical whatever) and NOT cse.\nIm sorry\nI hope im wrong but lets see",
    "jee mains + kcet have 45% seats how will they compare jee mains and kcet result ? are there any fixed seats for only jee mains?\n└── Read the comments ",
    "Read the comments on my previous  post for clarification, please 😭😭🙏🏼",
    "i didnt applied for round 1 counselling and going to apply for round 2 only through jee mains quota what percentile is needed to get cse in ec campus?\n└── No idea bro , but if it's above 95 you definately have a shot \n    └── can i take round 1 data for estimation?\n        └── Probably yes ",
    "That info is wrong, pes is taking 40% seats via jee, 40% via kcet, and the rest is probably management"
