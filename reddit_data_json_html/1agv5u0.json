    "ECE was terrible. Don't rely on PES if you are in ECE. Build a solid resume and search on your own alongside PES.",
    "Last I checked, in EC campus, less than 10 ppl from ECE were placed. Make of that what you will\n└── Holy shit\n    └── Yeah, people like me who joined pes because it had good placements aren't very happy lol"
