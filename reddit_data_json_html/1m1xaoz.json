    "If you get seat in pes , surrender your seat in other college (this is if u want pes and not the other college). The other college will have a surrender window. Use that and surrender after u get seat in pes. In case u missed the window , some colleges allow you to surrender seat with paying fine. They fine you everyday after you missed the window.\n\nIncase u wanted the other college then your all set.",
    "they are asking for original 10/12, but if submitted in other college, what to do ? 10th MS is compulsory"
