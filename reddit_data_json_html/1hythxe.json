    "From orientation which they did for us in 5th sem it was mentioned and told that it would be for 2 credits, 2-2-4-2 for each respective year. Here there might me some mistake ig.",

    "Capstone is 2 credits only this time like 5th sem. In 7th sem it's 4 and 8th 2 credits so total of 10 credits ",
    "Really can anyone confirm phase 2 project work is for 6 credits?\n└── Teachers said 6, maybe outdated as someone said in the orientation it was said 2 credits",
    "Yeah",
    "If it is 6 credits for this sem, then already 8 credits are done before 7th sem.\n\nHow will it be distributed in 7th and 8th sem?? (1+1) ? Doesn't make much sense",
    "Someone please share the cloud computing syllabus with me if there is one, really interested in what they're be teaching now",
    "Seems like printing mistake"
