    "KCET counselling will happen. Assume you get a seat in PES via the counselling conducted by KCET, you’ll be paying the fees of KCEt (less than 2 lakhs per annum iirc)\n\nWhereas if you don’t get a seat via KCET counselling but you still want to join PES, they have given you an alternative.  Everyone who couldn’t join will  send their ranks to PES. On a later date, PES themselves will conduct a counselling/allot seats based on the KCET ranks in order. But in such a case, you will pay fees which applies to JEE quota(5 lakhs per annum approx)\n└── Ohh thanks"
