    "'2029 juniors having their first \"Welcome to PES\" moment, love to see it\nâ””â”€â”€ Ain't joining pes after reading also the stuff on reddit ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­\n    â””â”€â”€ Understandable.\n        â””â”€â”€ Only thing I found best about pes were placements\n            â”œâ”€â”€ Ngl, that's all PES has going for it at the moment, apart from the crowd and alumni network.\n\nIf all you care about is a decent job at the end of 4 years, this place will do its job. But nothing more. But then, you wouldn't be paying 5L+/year for that unless you are *extremely* well off.\n            â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Rvce&gt;Manipal&gt;Pes&gt;Comedk colleges\nIs this a correct ranking?\n            â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ It really doesn't matter much. \n\nI'd say rvce=manippal=pes=remaining 2-3 top comedk colleges(bms, msrit, maybe another I'm missing) &gt;the rest of the comedk colleges. \n\nMost colleges in the same \"tier\" will give you roughly the same opportunities. It really depends on the students themselves after that.\n            â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ where would u keep thapar ? in same tier or below ? bcz im getting a seat at thapar in ECE and idk if i will get ECE here\n            â”‚   â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Same\n            â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ The top 3 do not have much difference among them, but yeah I guess you could say that is fairly accurate. Its been a while since I went through this process, so I am not the right person to answer.\n            â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ placement wise rv&gt;pes&gt;next 3 comedk clg cs&gt;manipal cs  but if u want more college life then manipal&gt;pes&gt;rv ( as what i have seen)\n            â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Pes is still better than most colleges in banglore right.. Like top 3 in banglore\n            â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Other than rvce and iiitb \nPes is way better than the rest. \nThe gap btw rvce and pes is not that much now.\n            â””â”€â”€ Could you share?",
    "Nah this is dum asf. What kind of college even does that? Fuck off\nâ””â”€â”€ Just wait for it , u will see what all this college can do",
    "When tf did the fees go up to 5.1L lmao?!\nâ””â”€â”€ Yes bruuhh. For students who are joining through jee have fee of 5.1L for Cse and 4.6L for ECE and 4.1L for other courses",
    "what happens if we dont take the seat though???\nâ””â”€â”€ I think you lose 10k. That was the process for management seat.\nThis is atrocious though!!!!\n    â””â”€â”€ That's pretty standard.\nI lost money on manipal like that.",
    "On top of that worst admission management they did a glitch with my rank messed up the internal ranking and now not picking calls and responding to emails \n\nPlus the mod doesn't even approve the posts I don't know what flair and what they are asking me to\nâ””â”€â”€ Any posts asking for advice on JEE rank will be deleted. If you were trying to post anything else, then DM the mods.\n    â””â”€â”€ Mod is the office close today ? They did a glitch with my rank because of which the ranking given by pesu is affected. They're not responding on mail and not picking calls\n\nAnd I wanted to ask if we can edit the rank will they release a new rank list then?\nThere is an option today I didn't know if it was yesterday too \n\nI was going to post this but it's not letting me\n        â””â”€â”€ Not sure. Try calling them if you haven't emailed yet, or if you live in Bangalore, visit the campus and get it sorted. Someone else also spoke about a glitch in another thread.\n            â””â”€â”€ There is an option to change rank but I'm not sure was it yesterday too, and if I do that will they release a new ranklist\n\nI have emailed them yesterday as well as a follow up today no response and I'm not from karnataka",
    "Got a rank of 1.3L in mains \nWill I get a seat by any chance? \nAs I saw on siksha web last year's cse closing rank was 2.3L something...plz help\nâ””â”€â”€ you can get ec campus with cse but idts you can get rr campus cause last year the cut off was around 1000 pes rank",
    "Pess jee rank cards are out . My brother got 2k . Will he be able to get cse?",
    "I havenâ€™t receive this mail but got the rank card. What should I do?"
