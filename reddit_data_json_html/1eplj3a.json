    "U need new friends\n└── He was an old friend and we parted our ways two years back and he hasn't changed a bit. This mf probably feels superior to the ones around him as anyone could tell by the way he brags and for some reason he thinks that every thing he does or has is the best of them all. Fortunately, I have a handful of good friends now who are supportive and most importantly honest. I'm sorry but had to vent it out.\n    └── he high af if bms has better placements that pes , as for clubs pes has a ton of good clubs technical or non techniacl ones, i am not from rr campus so i cant speak abt that but in the ec campus we have a ton of hackathrons and a lot of good teccnical clubs and stuff.",
    "Context for asking and some ranting:\n\nI felt an urge to ask this because a 'friend' of mine was constantly putting me down and mocking everything I texted him. Like using clown emojis and using the moai emoji to back his opinion(The thing is that he was definitely pissed about the fact that he wasn't getting any reservation even though he could have got SCG reservation but did not because his father is a government employee). He was also saying something like placements in bms&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;pes. But the thing that got me thinking was when he said that clubs in pes is shit and things like that. Is it true by any chance?"
