  "title": "Looking for Flats and Female Roommates Near RR Campus",
  "content": "Hey everyone!\n\nIâ€™ll be joining PESU (Ring Road Campus) for MCA this year. Iâ€™m already living in a pg  close to my current college, but this time Iâ€™m looking to shift to a flat for more space and comfort.\n\nI'm a female and looking for  female roommates whoâ€™re open minded, okay with non-veg food, chill and are willing to adjust. Iâ€™d really appreciate any leads or tips on:\n\n1. Good areas to stay near PES that are safe and have good connectivity.\n\n\n2. Rent range for a 1BHK/2BHK or shared flat nearby.\n\n\n3. Any active WhatsApp/Telegram groups, websites, or apps youâ€™d recommend for finding roommates or flat listings?\n\n\n4. If there are flats where other PES students are already staying, Iâ€™d love to know about that too!\n\n\nIf youâ€™re also joining PES or looking to shift, feel free to reach out â€” maybe we can team up and find a place together ðŸ™‚\n\nThanks in advance!\n",
