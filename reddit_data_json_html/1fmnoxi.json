    "These conditions are always confusing. It's best to clarify this with Somu. After all, he's the one who knows best. He usually doesn't respond to emails, you'll need to pay him a visit in person.\nâ””â”€â”€ He won't say properly.... Me and my friend went to ask him regarding it. He just smiles and says..... First u get selected then let's see..... ðŸ¥². Can you please confirm once with any of you friends. \n\nThanks a lot !!\n    â””â”€â”€ I graduated years ago lol, I don't think anyone really remembers the policy from my batch. \n\nI suggest visiting again and asking him. If he doesn't respond properly then just pass a comment saying you'll ask your parents to raise a formal inquiry.\n        â””â”€â”€ ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ ok bro sure !! I will go again and ask"
