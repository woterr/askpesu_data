    "Get FX-991 EX\n├── But what if I already have this one?\nStatistics student here\n│   └── You can still do most types of calculations but not all so it's not a compulsion to buy this model in specific.\n├── alright thanks!\n└── +1",
    "No,Get  any one from these three\nFx-991CW,\nFx-991EX,\nFx-991ES\n├── what about the 100ms one??\n└── thank you!",
    "Any calculator which can solve matrices and solve equations works",
    "This is exactly what I had, unfortunately it can't do scientific calc.. so its better you shift to FX-991   \nu/broke-my-feet has mentioned the models.. any one is fine\n├── I second this. I had the same one too and it's missing some real important stuff like solving definite integrals and doing cubic question. Not gonna lie, it has cost me a few marks.\n│   └── But that was OG.. a really good one!\n│       └── Can't deny.\n└── oh i see okayy",
    "This is shit you can't do matrix operation and so on....go for fx 991es",
    "Do I need to buy one in 1st year??",
    "PLEASE DO NOT GET THESE DOUBLE LINE ONES, you'll have a hard time in matrix questions+in this you probably can't even solve them\n\nGet the Casio textbook display ones (fx991 ex plus)\n\nOr what I would recommend you is to get the fx991 cw (i personally bought it after struggling with my 2 line calculator)\nYes it is a bit more expensive, but its worth it\nFaster+less chance of errors because you can see the exact values you have entered\n└── got it thanks!",
    "Get 991 cw, had this trash in first sem, can't do basic stuff like integration or summation",
    "You can try to get the graphic one. But this is the basic one required for the exams. It depends on the branch and teachers input.",
    "991 ex is the best\n\nU get to perform calculations of degree 4 and even vectors of higher dimensions compared to the other ones",

    "https://pesufy.netlify.app/docs/third_page/. Check this",
    "What is the need?? Is it allowed in exams??\n├── Yep\n└── lol, bro is stuck in school.\n    └── What do you expect from a person who is studying in school for the past 14 yrs??\n        └── to be aware of how things work ahead.",
    "This calci Is enough u don't need another one",
    "Yes.. this will do.. anything non programmable will do"
