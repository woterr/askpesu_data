As a hostelite in the boys hostel of the ec campus ,I have seen a increase in the racist remarks thrown towards the north east workers  in the pixel food court  and today was one such instance . A north east worker who works there was insulted really bad by some students cause he was taking time to get their order and was called some derogatory words and some other students too who joined in on this. I hope we as a community not encourage such behavior .",

    "This is indeed a big issue. People these days think just because they call their friends names, they can be rude to strangers as well. I myself have seen some college students call the security guard the n-word or abuse him in English. Just because he doesn't understand English doesn't mean you can abuse him. \n\nAs for your experience, try to pass a note anonymously to your warden and make those fuckers pay for what they did.",
