  "content": "I don't get it. I'm in my 6th semester, studying CSE. So we got news saying we have labs for every subject. One lab every day. On top of that we have 5 internal assessments. \n\nIt's so annoying and tiring. The chairperson told us not to expect a response and said the system won't change. \n\nApparently ece peeps have to write notes and upload on teams. This is getting so outta hand. I thought 6th semester was the most important one. They're dumping so much on us and we even have capstone. \n\nTo anyone who is planning on joining pes, please fuckin DON'T. Pes is a scam. \n\nAnd what tf can we do about this shit now? Everyone's willing to protest. But how can we raise our concerns in s more serious manner?\n\nAny info can help. Thanks in advance",

    "What the fuck is going on in this college like literally every year it seems to get worse",
    "it makes no sense. The old system was fine, there was NO REASON to go and change it and give the students MORE WORKLOAD than we already have! It feels like every subject has assignments and projects and 5 ISAs AND they increased the number of hours in the week, that's way too much to handle, along with capstone.\n├── Exactly! They want to change the system like \"foreign universities\" have theirs\n│   └── They compared us to schools in Tokyo and said \"The students in Tokyo work the entire day!\" as if that's a valid reason to make our lives even more hectic than it already is.\n│       └── Yep. Shit will only get worse. We haven't even started capstone shit yet. I'm so not looking forward to it fuck ( ⚈̥̥̥̥̥́⌢⚈̥̥̥̥̥̀)\n└── they increased the hours? damn how many hours a day so you guys have classes?\n    └── It's now 30 hours a week, along with assignments, projects and labs (for nearly every subject) plus our capstone project. Not to mention internals after every unit, so we effectively have 5 ISAs each for 5 subjects.",
    "Agree with all your points. PES is becoming too rigorous for studies and have no consideration of students in mind :/\n\nWhat's the point of calling yourself a university if all you do is study\n\nRegarding protests, it's a private institution and the decision cannot be changed by UGC because it's not going against any guidelines. I think pressure from parents and students can try to stir the college for a change. Get parents involved because they are the only \"stakeholders\" PES is concerned about. Please remain anonymous during all interactions because stuff like this can have future consequences on your graduation!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood Luck\n└── Oh yeah, true that. Thanks a lot :')\n\nI've no idea how we're gonna get through this. We'll have ISAs every 2 weeks now",

    "They really don't want us to get placed😂",
    "Holy shit I'm glad I'm out of here. If you're in your 6th sem you're already starting the placement grind. What the hell are they thinking? Is this some kind of new thing they're putting in place for online classes?\n├── On a side note, is placements hard? T-T\n│   ├── Tbh not really. Getting placed is fairly straightforward, just that the really high paying ones need more skill and luck. If you took the advanced Algos elective and understood it well, that's pretty much all you need. Problem rn is that all you guys are competing online, so there's a lot more cheating and it's harder as such.\n\nDisclaimer that my advice is from like 2019\n│   │   └── Ah, I didn't take advanced algo. Guess I'm fucked. I'm fairly above average but I'm a noob in competitive coding. If only I had the time to practice T-T\n\nThanks for the info though :')\n│   └── Placements is not \"hard\"\n\nYou need to know that\n\n\\&gt; PESU is just responsible for getting companies to college; you getting in or not isn't their scope\n\n\\&gt; You getting into any company is purely based on how skilled you are and how well you perform during interviews and tests\n\n\\&gt; As a suggestion, probably google the role you want to pursue or check LinkedIn for the requirement for your role, in the coming months, start taking up courses or learning those skills\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoood Luck for your placements xD\n│       └── Ahh, this makes a lot of sense. Thanks a lot :)\n└── Oh XD\nOnline? Nah nah, it's gonna be the same shit fir offline too. They want it to be like how it is in foreign universities apparently\n    └── That's got to be the worst reason I've heard. The way they do it abroad isn't multiple tests, it's multiple assignments that you solve at home. Half the time they either count for very little, or otherwise make up a majority of your grade.\n        └── Exactly. These people want to incorporate both systems and made one huge mess",
    "Ece peeps needing to upload notes is a stupid whatsapp forward lol.\n└── Yeah? I mean my friends who are in ece actually got that announcement and they've actually uploaded notes :')"
