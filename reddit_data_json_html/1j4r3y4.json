    "I usually recommend to LinkedIn and Google job listings. Once you find a posting by a company, I open up their career page and find other roles which aren't indexed by Google.",
    "For jobs or internships, u can use websites like wellfound and Bluelearn. Both are good if u are looking for roles in startups or some small companies. for larger companies, apply via careers site / Linkedin, but beware of easy apply,\nâ””â”€â”€ whats easy apply?\n    â””â”€â”€ Its like a feature where, only if u are within the top 100 to click that button, ur resume will be seen else there is no point of that easy apply.",
    "Internshala is a great place to find internships,\nFew of the internships there are a scam\nOther than those, it's pretty good"
