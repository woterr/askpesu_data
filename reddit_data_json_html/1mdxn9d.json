  "content": "The list of the shortlisted students for eternal is out and many students with higher CGPAs like 8.5+ are not shortlisted, even though people with CGPAs  till 8 are shortlisted. The company also did not mention that they are doing resume-based shortlisting. Has something like this happened before?",

    "Yeah even I was wondering the same..! They did not mention any other criteria except that of CGPA",
    "They do little bit resume shortlisting too, in the sense not very thoroughly but it's there. Last year also it happened and criteria just remained mystery."
