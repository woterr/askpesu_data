    "At PES, we only have PRIDE for breakfast, lunch and dinner :vckek:\n└── Brother any idea about when classes will start as I came here to do document verification and wants to go back home and take all my stuff with me.\n    └── Even the director isn’t sure — he told me that the college will likely open after KCET Round 1, which is scheduled for August 10th. So, I guess we can expect the session to start sometime after August 15th — maybe around the 20th, 25th, or even in September. But don’t worry, they’ll inform us at least a week in advance.\n        └── Thanks it helped me a lot brother 🤝",
    "Mess was one of the best compared to RV and BMS back in 2019. I hope it’s the same now.\nFooding was never an issue for our batch."
