Use your brain, j say what's been asked or stfu and mind your business. Poking your finger into every pie doesn't make you intellectual. And he claims to know everything about everything ðŸ¤¡ literally calls people dumb and gets offended if ypu call him one or just says lmao, like bro wtf are you on everytime you come into the convo?",
