    "Assuming you're in CS, you'd need a laptop from first year. You wouldn't need it from day 1 but you'd have labs every week where you'd need a laptop.\n\nThink beyond the curriculum, you'd be using your laptop as a tool. You'd be using it for so many other things - hackathons, side projects, etc.\n\nPurchase one with decent specifications. I'd suggest buying a second hand M series laptop (whichever you're able to afford, but it has to be M series)"
