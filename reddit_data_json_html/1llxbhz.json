    "i don't know exactly about what they mean when they say \"u cannot withdraw ur seat after 7th july\".  \nbut for us last year jawahar in one of the orientations said that we are gonna give you a seat in pes irrespective of, if you hv a pending josaa and other counselling processes, and later when you get a seat allotted in the pending counselling processes we are gonna give your entire fee refund except 10k for registration process and stuff. so explain to to them in detail abt ur query, they will tell u wat cud be done exactly"
