    "if your focus is only placements then pes, we have better placement percentage, so you are more likely to land a job here\n\nif you want to have good quality of life then manipal\n\nalso i think pes is a cheaper option, so thats another reason to choose pes (better return on investment possible here)",
    "Manipal cs any day\n└── Any reason,  please i need an explanation to make a decision.\n    └── Placement is same , now choose between great college life and no college life. And from what I have heard studies will be chiller in manipal too making scoring a good cgpa easier.\n        └── Academics are harder at manipal",
    "MIT cse no brainer\n└── Any reasoning behind it? In terms of placement or better education",

    "Mit manipal no doubt\n└── Between manipal and rvce\n    ├── Rvce Cse &gt; Manipal CSE (normally)\nRvce cse = PES CSE (if ur gpa in pes is 9+)\n    └── Manipal",
    "PES For placements/academics/blr location\n\nManipal for better campus life/foreign opportunities\n└── I want to pursue mtech afterwards, so would you say manipal is better than that?\n    └── Neither would give any significant advantage."
