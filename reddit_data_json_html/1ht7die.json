    "bros coooked. Contact your class teacher, make up some reason like medical issues or sumn.\nâ””â”€â”€ Medical issue for 6 weeks? Where Iâ€™ve attended normal classes but not online?ðŸ˜­",
    "I think they wont consider for this subject â€¦\n\nAlso of they consider u have to make up with medical certificates n shit",
    "Don't worry too much,in my batch too most didn't attend still there was no issue.",
    "For future info, you should know that attendance is counted for all credited courses, regardless of whether it's reflected on the app. The app has always been inconsistent with showing the correct attendance (even before my time, so it's an ages old issue), so never go by the app and always track attendance yourself as much as possible (you can use any simple attendance manager app, that's what I did). Remember that the app might not show the right attendance but it does store it when the profs record it.\n\nFor now, just try requesting and submitting some medical leave documents. Hopefully they go easy on you since it's not really an important course",
    "Dw, theyâ€™ll let you write. The least theyâ€™ll do is ask all those who has less attendance to meet chairperson and you get asked why you didnâ€™t attend. Tell them you forgot your teams password or just cook up a story and theyâ€™ll excuse you.",
