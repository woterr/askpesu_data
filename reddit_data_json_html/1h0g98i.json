    "We are in for a ride(Engineering Mathematics-2)ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Bruh I'm not able to survive in Engineering mathematics -1 ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ M1 aint that tough tbh just learn the diff eqn formulas, M2 on the other hand better pray on it.\nâ”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ It is tough for me send help ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­Â \nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ I too had problems with it. And just studying formulas don't help.\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ Ya i understood that but wt to do...\nâ”‚           â””â”€â”€ Go for tuitions either within or outside collage.\nâ”‚               â””â”€â”€ Wt u mean within CLG ?I don't get it like wt I HV to doÂ  nvm I'm dumb asf ... Plz clarifyÂ \nâ”‚                   â””â”€â”€ Ask ur teachers for help. They will be willing to explain or talk to HOD they'll arrange\nâ”‚                       â””â”€â”€ Sure I HV to do thatÂ \nâ”œâ”€â”€ You'll have math in 3rd and 4th sem too. After that, depending on the courses you have (and opt to take up), you'll have math again\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Nah nah in 3 rd sem we didnâ€™t had math\nIn 4 th we had..\n\n\nAnd that will be last if we are not opting math in any electives!\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ &gt;Nah nah in 3 rd sem we didnâ€™t had math\n\nNot a MA course, but you definitely do have statistics, probability and counting as part of SDS (or currently the rebranded MCSE - Math for CS) course. These are still technically \"math\" courses.\nâ”‚           â””â”€â”€ Yeah if we consider that then yes\nâ”œâ”€â”€ In 3rd sem we have MCSE which is related to math\nâ””â”€â”€ Engineering mathematics -2 was much easier than engineering mathematics-1\n    â””â”€â”€ tf didnt like 450 people fail last year in engineering math -2   \ni didnt think math-1 could beat that"
