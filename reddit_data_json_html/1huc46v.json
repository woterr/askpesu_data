    "I've seen people across like 5-6 years in the age spectrum on this subreddit, and I've yet to come across even one person who enjoyed DDCO, loved the subject and was passionate about it. And don't @ me with \"muhhhh faculty baaaad\" because my DDCO prof was the legendary Dr. Ch He ðŸ˜­\n\nDDCO lovers pls reply thx\nâ””â”€â”€ Not a DDCO lover but a u/abaksy lover uwu",

    "Was gonna type some hater shit but it seems like you're just mad at yourself, not others.\n\nLock in, prioritize whatever you need to sort out in your life (I'd say prioritize fixing your sleep schedule first). Things start to seem clear when you handle it one step at a time. \n\nEveryone needs time for themselves, and I suggest you dedicate quite some time to no one but yourself.\n\nP.S. even I was burnt out after 5th sem and pretty much just spent most of the sem break in some game or the other. Luckily, results were good and I feel like I've gathered myself enough to handle 6th sem. Stay strong, you'll pull through.",
    "Fuck that, post college life is so much better juniors, trust me",
    "As you progress through the semesters, the excitement proportionally decreases. I feel you buddy.\nâ””â”€â”€ **proportionally** might be slightly understating it mate :)",
    "Good username OP, but you canâ€™t hate it more than me",
    "Chill bud, just bunk",
    "Why nobody getting the reference lmao",
    "Chill bro",
    "I mean some people get turned on by the concept of learning, not pre-glazing the teachers per se, but yes there are mfers who do that and it's very evident who those are and they are annoying af",
