  "content": "I got PES through pesujee, so like the fees will be similiar. The only advantage im seeing in PES is that there is a way to get some moneyback from the college and also its in banglore.\n\nHowever currently i prefer manipal as its more reputed, better campus, better hostel life and id rather do mnc than cse. \n\nMy home is just 4km from PES, hence if i decide to join PES il mostly be at home , but if i join manipal i can live in the hostels which i want to do.\n\nHence i am asking , is there any convincing reason why PES might be a better choice than MIT",

    "I'm pretty sure placements and ROI will be better in PES considering ur commute/hostel scenario as well as scholarships and placements of the branches in general.\n\n  \nAltho undoubtedly you'll be missing out on college/hostel life and I think extracurricular clubs of MIT are better surely.",
