  "content": "I was a jee aspirant, always liked PES college I wrote kcet but couldn't get my favourite college ( pes) I had a lot of hopes that I'll get into this clg but ended up getting 6k rank pes ec is 2km from my home. Since 3 months I am seeing this subreddit and praying I'll get this clg.. but of no use, too much rank inflation, soo many droppers and what not... anyways always liked those huge buildings I could see while travelling around but nevertheless I feel like a looser.. I got pes EC campus cse through jee but can't afford the feesðŸ¥² I have gone through almost all posts while dreaming of getting into pes but anyways it's my fate...\nAll the best to those who got this clg.... \n4yrs of hopes shattered\nI am a bit emotional coz all of those harwork went  in vain \nNevertheless, it's my last visit to this subreddit \nPeace out gng ðŸ¥€ \n",
