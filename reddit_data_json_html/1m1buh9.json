    "Can't really say but in my case when I tried to submit photocopies of the original they outrightly refused",
    "That dosent work, I had the same problem when I joined. CBSE allows you to get your original marksheet at your home but it takes like 15-20 days. Till then just mail them I don’t think it’ll be an issue. If you’re in Chandigarh then well and good the headquarters are there so might as well collect it yourself"
