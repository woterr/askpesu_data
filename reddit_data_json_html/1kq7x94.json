    "cooked if there's no relative",
    "We had negligible grace marks (which is what is generally called relative grading here) given to us in CN, DAA. Highly relative in MPCA tho. OS and LAA, there was 0 relative grading.",
    "Depends on how your batch performs in your current semester. Historical data does not play a role in deciding whether a course is graded relatively. However, trends usually show that students tend to perform poorly in the same courses across all generations.\nâ””â”€â”€ This is literally the only answer ðŸ˜­ sometimes there's relative in subjects you don't expect , I don't think it's predictable in any way except batch performance",
    "Last year for 2026 Batch there was no relative grading for MPCA absolutely not. CN paper was straightforward for us. Not much of relative grading by a grade ! It will be by 5-7 marks maximum not a grade increase. Anywhere around 92-95 out of 120 will be A grade"
