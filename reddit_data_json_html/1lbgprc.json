    "Majority took SC and ADA (kinda tough but very interesting just pay attention in  class) \nand we had SCM for sem 6(easy PPL take it just to increase their GPA)\n\nLLM was quite good and has overlap with Deep learning in sem6 one of the core subjects\n\nSC,ADA AND NLP were handled by BJD sir(for us might be different in your case) and we had ton of assignments,mini projects and kaggle competitions which might be hectic but if u like the subject then it's gonna be a fun ride \n\nHave no clue abt the other electives as many got cancelled for us\n└── Llm mentioned here is LLM and their applications"
