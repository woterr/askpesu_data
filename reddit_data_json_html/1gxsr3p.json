HP or DBT ? \nI have taken BD as my 2nd elective ,so I think it should be helpful for DBT . But any suggestions though ? Which one is scoring ?\n    └── Both are good electives. In EC last year, HP got cancelled due to low strength, so I had to take DBT. It was chill.\n        └── Okay ! Thank you"
