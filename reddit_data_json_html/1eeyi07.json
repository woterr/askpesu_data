    "Most of your cgpa is decided by 6th sem. After 6th sem you'll have a whole year free where you won't have to come to college at all. You might need to come a few days for your capstone reviews and some exams but most of the time you'll be free at home. That's enough time to study for any exams you want to attempt and prepare for placements. You don't have to choose placements over exams, you can do both as long as they don't clash on the same day. Just use that time wisely and u can do both\n└── tku"
