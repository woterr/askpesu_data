    "DW they won't blacklist apply again just that if you get the same interviewer then you might get in some trouble otherwise it shoudl go on buisness as usual.\n└── No like someone said they'll have your details and all so don't apply again\n\nBut they didn't really take any of my documents just my nane parents name and the schools and uni i studied at\n    └── Exactly they only have you as a reference number in their system, once you get a new reference number you're a new person to them as simple as that....\n        └── But the rest of my details will be the same right? won't they cross check that\n\nIt's still letting me use the same number too just asks for a unique mail id\n            └── try toh kr bro hogi jo dekhi jaegi\n                └── Bhai Check my update\n                    └── Dw give the interview as if you're giving it for the first time you're not cooked you just took advantage of a loophole which should be fine...\n                        └── Should I still give the same number or a different number because I left the number half filled cause I still wasn't sure that's why they called me today\n\nIs it fine cause they themselves were expecting me to fill it again she just said book the slot again so I think they're expecting me to fill it again anyways?\n                            └── doesn't matter atp, cuz they're EXPECTING you to fill AGAIN\n                                └── Alright 😭 ill use the same number but if they ask why I'll tell them i attended last time but the teacher couldn't hear me properly and the zoom call was cut short ig that's why i'm applying again (which isnt technically false)",
