    "There would be E-stamp notary shops in the city , check near your house.  \nThey usually have sign boards for doing voter id , pan card , rental agreement etc.  \nyou can take the stamp paper print from them and take a sign from an advocate if u know any , otherwise these shops also have an advocate you can ask them.\n└── Thank you so much!",
