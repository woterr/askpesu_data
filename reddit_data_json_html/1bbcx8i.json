  "content": "I understand this college's affiliation to the BJP and the college doesn't make it less obvious either. But this is a new low. No educational institution has the right to politicise itself like this (Please don't quote me if I'm wrong). Literally placing campaign banners just as the elections are close by.\n A few questions:\n1) Can/Should we do anything about this?\n2) What are your opinions?\n3) Will first time voters be actually influenced by such embarrassing campaigning in Universities as reputed as ours?\n\nPic 1 and 2 are from the main gate\nPic 3 is in front of the student lounge by GJB\n\nP.S: Just want to say that this is not a political party problem, this is just not the right place in my opinion. You'd probably see a post like this from me if it were another party.",

    "Back in 2021, after the covid 2nd wave in summer that year, PES called us all for in person end semester exams. A lot of the students were not ready and scared to do so and understandably so. But the college insisted. Other colleges either passed their students or postponed their exams. But this mf, was adamant on us coming. So we had to call up NSUI, national students union India. These guys were the ones who were the voice of students in other parts of the state, mangalore. MYSURU etc. They planned a huge protest. There were mails sent, a scandalous reply from Jawahar also came, students were enraged. There was a protest planned,with the support of NSUI. NSUI guys areaffiliated with the Congress party. One day before the protest was planned, there was a meeting with the college officials and the NSUI. After the meeting the protest was cancelled. Apparently, the NSUI was threatened with consequences if they don't step back. That was the first time, when I realised the power of association with BJP the college has.\n\nDo not get into this mess. First of all you should stay away from PES. If you get in, you will see stuff like this. You have to turn a blind eye to this and get on with your infinite assignments and exams.\n├── Maybe contacting NSUI now would have different outcome (maybe) xD\n│   └── Haha maybe\n└── Congress is even more cringe and mostly employs goons and close relatives.\n    └── Bro so do BJP it's the staple in politics",
    "You do not want to get into this.\n└── One of the only sensible replies I've gotten. Thank you.\n    └── Seems like they removed it today morning lmao I'm not able to spot it only",
    "Answer to your questions\n\n1. Yes, by not giving a flying fuck \n2. I want you to realise that you are in PESU not DU or any other north uni.. also many here are least bothered by this, everyone wants to finish their degree and get out of this place\n3. No, when I joined, Foreign minister had visited our college.. and I was well aware of this uni backed by a political party..\n\nAs a first time voter, I did my research and voted for the party that I felt would benefit my state. I am sure other first time voters are also well aware of whats happening in the state and country right now.. surely they will vote for the right party.\n└── Fair.",
    "Apparently I can't edit the body of this post, so I'll drop a comment.\nI'm happy with some of the mature and sensible suggestions I've gotten so far. I've understood now that this is probably something to stay away from. But I still think its wrong for educational institutions to influence political views or to allow banners for a party just because the institute favours a certain agenda. \nFrom comments I've read, I've found a lot of them amusing and hilarious to assume I'm a leftist just because I don't favour political campaigning in institutes that are educational. Best believe, you would've seen the same reaction if there was a INC/JDS/any political party. But I can't prove that because the banner that's up there belongs to the BJP.\n├── &gt;. But I still think its wrong for educational institutions to influence political views or to allow banners for a party just because the institute favours a certain agenda. \n\n\nUmm welcome to the adult world I'd say. Not to offend you in any sense but every person, everything, and every institution has a political ideology and an inclination to that. It just isn't about BJP. It is how it is, with every political party in their domain. Especially academia, is highly ideological and political. You cannot run away from it, you cannot change it either. If you are affiliated with nsui, sfi, and want a career in politics, make an issue out of this, do protests and put forward your demands. If not, don't think too much. Its Not gonna bring you any good.\n└── Really funny when I see lot of leftist campaigning during my college years in Kolkata.\nMy bachelors in Loyola saw lots of munnetra kazhagams in my campus. My \"student\" unions use to support parties during elections.\n\nI think parties will always try to influence students as they are a powerful vote bank. Students can either go with the flow and be influenced (like they do on many fronts) or do their due diligence and research and vote.",
    "1. Nah  \n2. Nothing to give opinion on, I don't even know why you care about this   \n3. Not at all, people our age have already decided whom to give our votes to. The last I'd do is get influenced by a banner lmao\n├── I care about it, because I don't think it's right and I represent this college. Its not a nice look for an \"educational\" institute to show off it's political bias in this fashion. This said, I agree with your last point. So, thank you for this comment.\n│   ├── Well you can try conducting protest or complain to some authority. But its very risky for your future prospects\n│   │   └── A protest is completely out of question.

    "OP eventhough we live in a democracy, it's a backsliding one, even if someone gives opposing opinions to ruling party they'll be labeled leftist\nWe can't argue in a place where no criticism is allowed \nBest just hope for nothing bad to happen \n\n(BTW I don't understand why y'all hate on leftists\nAnd commenters pls don't embarrass yourself by calling anyone with an opposing opinion as leftist)",

    "It's more common for University level political campaigns in India than you think. Up here on my campus in Punjab, you can see AAP banners literally on the main gate.

    "\"It's not the right place\" true, but their motives would be to get this place accustomed more, it'll come on news to gain some positive advertisement of the GJBC they've built.
