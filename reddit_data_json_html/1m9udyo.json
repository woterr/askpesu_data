    "Bro why do so much for hostel just stay in a pg near by. Hostel in pes is too strict and you will have very less freedom\n├── pes hostels are way better than pgs tho\n│   └── In what ways?\n├── Any good pgs nearby?\n│   └── Most of the good ones are prolly full by now \nBut you might get slightly further from campus\n└── wdym by less freedom"
