I felt like Hercules doing the 12 labours with how hard it was to get to college. Only reason I got to college is because I heard someone play KSI's new song and I got the willpower to go and turn that off",

Will bombs falling from sky make them declare holiday\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Maybe add napalm just in case they still don't budge\nâ””â”€â”€ Lol those days.. \n\nOur batch thought of calling some student union n all, LOL\nDore n his son didn't give a Fk, they didn't even conduct one single exam online...",
