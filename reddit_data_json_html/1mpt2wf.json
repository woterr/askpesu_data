    "Get a mac, u will be bringing ur laptop to college regularly from 2nd year onwards, it's way lighter than most windows laptop and convenient to carry. The portability alone makes it a better option. I bought a reaaaaaally expensive windows laptop but regret buying it cuz it's so fucking heavy, I workout at the gym just so I can carry it around lmfao\nâ””â”€â”€ Oh okay\n    â””â”€â”€ No bro u actually have to do less work than windows users if anything is not working linux is always an option\n        â””â”€â”€ Ok bro now I am convinced to take mac",
    "I own a gaming laptop but would suggest mac . If you are not that much into gaming\nâ””â”€â”€ Okay",
    "For dev work, Macâ€™s a good choice (macOS is the closest to Linux), and yeah, some softwares wonâ€™t run natively, just use UTM or some online emulator.",
    "Just buy an old thinkpad (t480) and flash some linux distro on it\nâ””â”€â”€ Here comes the Linux nerd, no hate ofc",
    "Macbook is the best choice\nâ””â”€â”€ Kay",
    "Using a MacBook for college applications is just extra work.\nIf u don't mind doing lil more than the windows users then it's all good\n\nWhatever u take but windows will always be a better option for me\nâ””â”€â”€ Ahhh okay ðŸ˜­ , which is the best windows laptop under 70k or 50k\n    â””â”€â”€ Go with a mac bro, it's much better than windows laptops"
