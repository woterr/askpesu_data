  "title": "Lack of goth girls on PESU campus",
  "content": "\n\nAs a second year boy at PESU EC college, I am saddened at the lack of goth girls who study here. The majority of girls here are Lana del Rey and Taylor Swift fans wearing kala kurtas and baggy jeans with a serious lack of personality and originality. I know that the nearly nonexistent representation of the goth girl subculture at PESU colleges is likely tied to a few aspects, like how PESU colleges are infamous for its grand parties and Fests, (not typically a goth girl interest) the constant depressing and cold atmosphere, and the overall lack of awareness about goth culture here. I know that my fellow PESU male students are also disappointed at the lack of goth mommies here, they likely just hide their pain better than I am capable of. Or even Perhaps I am merely looking in the wrong places. I believe without finding a goth girl my mental health will continue to plummet and I may also have to look into transferring to DSU or Christ if this issue does not get resolved.",

    "Anniversary Gifts: Gothic Edition  \nEver since Aleister Crowley wrote the definitive list of wedding anniversary gifts in 1899, the tradition has carried on with presents of Paper for the first anniversary, Gold for the 50th, Diamond for the 60th, and many fun ventures in between.   \nBut what can the discerning goth give a loved one or polycule for their anniversary while avoiding the common Victorian tradition?   \nHere is the official list by the most famous goth of all, Orval Madden:  \n1- Spider-Themed Jewelry  \n2- Black Leather Or PVC  \n3- One (1) Vincent Price Movie On VHS  \n4- Barnes &amp; Noble’s Leatherbound “Complete Works of Edgar Allan Poe”  \n5- Cloth Cut From A Condemned Clergyman, Or A Nice Hourglass With A Little Silver Skull On It  \n10- Darkness, Sadness, And Pain (Written In Calligraphy On Framed Parchment)  \n20- Bloodborne for PS4, Or One (1) Tear From Your Cheek In A Glass Vial  \n30- Complete Skeleton Of A Small Animal, Or One (1) Human Bone  \n40- All Siouxsie “MixTape” On A Wax Phonograph Cylinder  \n50- Live Bats  \n60- Your First Childhood Toy, Damaged By Time And Neglect, Which Once Unveiled Reminds You Of The Last Time You Felt Hope And Grew Painfully Beyond it, Declaring That You Would No Longer Feel, Only Days Later Meeting Your True Love, Tragically Forever Unable To Embrace Them With Anything More Than A Sad Memory Of What You Once Believed Love Could Be.  \n66- Bela Lugosi’s Corpse",
