    "Don't choose Jyothi r, chita g m and priyanka h. Avoid them at all cost. Even preethi p is not so good, but if you don't have an option it's a good one then\n├── What about ashwini m joshi, Dinesh singh, Surabhi Narayan, Shivagamasundari\n└── What about ashwini m joshi, Dinesh singh, Surabhi Narayan, Shivagamasundari\n    ├── Surabhi mam is great. Other all are not so good for ml domain.\n    │   └── Ashwini mam was our CN faculty in 4th sem and was very good at teaching and hands-on. But some reddit posts on her says that she is not good at mentoring [but it seems that she is well versed in her domain-ML(I'm telling this based on her depth knowledge and clarity on explanation in CN)] and won't provide good grades. The grades are decided by panel and not by mentors right?\n\nIf anyone got her as a capstone mentor or any of your friends got her &amp; shared their experience with you, please share it with me as soon as possible.🙏\n    │       └── Grade depends majorly on your mentor more than panel;\n    │           └── Please tell about her (Ashwini mam) as a mentor\n    │               └── I have heard she is not so good as a mentor.\n    └── Shivagamma no way"
