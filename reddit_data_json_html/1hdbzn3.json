    "They won't normalise just the ISA scores. You can go and review your ISA marks right? Just attend the review. That should give you a better idea. You can't do anything until the review.\n└── Ok after reviewing is there anything I must keep in mind\n    └── Honestly, nothing really. If your marks don't increase even after review, you can try approaching the HOD/COE. Although I've never heard of anyone reviewing a review before lol.

You should know that in general, it *is* possible to get 0 in lab marks. Now has someone got it in that specific course? No clue. I don't go around and keep a record of everyone's ACD lab marks.",
