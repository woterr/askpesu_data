    "Alongside just applying on linkedin or company websites, cold outreach to people and startups on linkedin is probably your best bet. You could also see if you can shadow any of your relatives or people you may know in your network.\n\nThere’s like 3 ways to go about it: \n\nReach out to people at firms where you would like to potentially intern, ask if you can speak to them to learn about their experience and get advice on how to get to where they are. Don’t mention anything about an internship at the start. If you have a good conversation, then ask if there’s any way you can contribute over the summer or ask to be connected to someone else in the team and the cycle continues. Also ask them if they know of any leads or opportunities in their network for someone like yourself.\n\nReach out to people or recruiters and directly ask if there are any internship opportunities at the firm they work at.\n\nReach out to startups and ask if you can help out over the summer. Express that you’re willing to do anything to help out with the main goal of learning. Be ready to work for zero pay. \n\nNetworking is key and it’s a numbers game. Try reaching out as much as you can, and expect a super high rejection rate. But you potentially only need one response to lead to something.\n\nI did this in my second year (I was in the BTech program however) and got a financial modelling internship with a real estate company. So speaking from experience, it is possible."
