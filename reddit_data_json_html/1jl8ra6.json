  "content": "It's almost everyday I'm reminded that we still live in a developing country despite the claims people like to make about India's progress. \n\nI mean I was just trying to fill my water bottle, when some random chick cuts in front of me, then another and then some guy even pushes me out the way. Like damn guys, relax. This isn't Africa, there's water for everyone! Just give people the common courtesy of waiting for your turn.\n\nApparently there's a token system for ordering food at GJBC.They print your token no on the bill. Never have I seen it in use? I mean, why do I have to claw my way through a crowd, stepping on the feet of my own peers, shouting my order at the guy on the other side of the counter. Why do I have to elbow someone out of the way, just to get my lunch? Why do all this when I can sit and relax until my token no is called?\n\nWe have this shit in malls. These same people who like animals...fight over the same plate of parathas, will wait in a very civil and calm manner until their token number is called. \n\nThe part of it that really irritates me, isn't that I'm being cut in front of. It's the fact that we're all supposed to be graduates from the university that offers the best placements in the state. Saying we're educated would be an understatement. We're the cream of the crop. Yet, it seems we're unable to be the change we'd like to see. We Indians have this stereotype of having no manners around the world, of being crude and uncivil. It's like I'm reminded where that comes from everyday.\n\nI really hate being this. I don't want to shout my order, or push people around. I'm a goddamn educated mf. And y'all are too. Why do we have to behave like animals.\n\nLet's change together, please. ",

    "to sum up you want civic sense. yeah mate better luck next time\n├── unfortunate truth\n├── Truth is it cannot change.. it won’t change.. at least in next 20 years..\n│   └── 20?, our current generation is equally or dare i say more worse than the prev generations when it comes to civic and common sense\n└── This passive attitude of doing nothing about it guarantees that shit will NEVER change. Someone give this guy a medal for saying the obvious. You're attitude is part of the problem",
    "I hate this bruh, all of these people are the same people who will behave wayy better in foreign countries. \nIn class our teacher was making us sign some sheet and most people stood in line but a few people just skipped ahead and and i asked them where the line was and she said there is no line.\n└── That's because outside India, there's huge societal pressure and expectations everywhere, be it a small shop or even a big mall. Social conditioning makes people not question these rules. They automatically stand in line to blend in. Such is the pathetic human mind. It just does what everyone is doing.",
    "You know what absolutely annoys me the most? These fucktards who practically unhinge their jaws to create a liplock with their bottles, then they put the bottle so far up the tap it's almost being throatfucked. \n\nDo people seriously have no bloody common sense?\n└── nice",
    "The next time when you notice someone with a lack of basic manner and patience cast a spell of eternal guilt and despair so they can cry their eyes out and transform into a swollen bean. 😤\n\nBut anyways man , I feel ya those guys have a brain size equivalent to a peanut. Nvm those dimwits, they get on people's nerves in an instant. 🫂",
    "ts aint improving unless u get out of this country",
    "what if there was an app for ordering GJBC Food, and also if waiters existed to serve to ur table?\n└── I can't tell if this is sarcasm but my guy...if it is...it's not that hard to follow a token no. It makes everyone's lives less stressful. And I'm sure you've ordered food in a food court at a mall. There's no waiters there either.🙏"
