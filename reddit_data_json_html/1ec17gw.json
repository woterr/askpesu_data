    "I got near 300 in kcet nd i m choosing rvce cs\nBut it takes me 1hr to travel on metroðŸ’€ðŸ’€\nâ””â”€â”€ goddamm thats nice but yeah travelling for an hour is a pain",
    "Choose rv as travel time will be a huge factor\nâ”œâ”€â”€ what should I choose between rv and pes if travel time is not an issue(I'm getting AIML in rv acc to previous year cutoffs and CSE at pes)\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ If it's cse at rr branch then go for it , core CS is still better than aiml specialization.\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ alright, thanks!\nâ””â”€â”€ thank you, also is it reasonable if I chose RV cyb sec over PES core cs? I know core cs is overall better but I won't get that in RV and apparently cyber sec has 75% same syllabus as core cs\n    â””â”€â”€ Every specialization has 60 to 70% same syllabus as core CS in most collages, if your gonna have to choose between rv cyber security vs pes rr ces than pes is a better choice.\n        â””â”€â”€ thank you again",
    "choose rv for better placements and alumni network"
