    "No , clubs don't matter at all , it's just for socialising",
    "Not Mandatory , But good for networking. Also you have to manage club work with academics.",
    "You should first get rid of the mindset of 'if it's not mandatory, I'm not doing it'. Do things out of interest. Do things you're passionate about. Have a hobby. Not everything is a rat race",
    "man tbh I feel everyone should at least join 1 club of their interest"
