    "Important enough to fuck or make your grade\n└── We have chosen a chill guide who is a mediocre teacher, so how will it affect us\n    └── It will affect u for no support for the project (they mostly do shit anyway) and good grades cause of leniency Fromm guide\n        └── Isn't the panel responsible for our grades or guides are responsible too ?\n            └── Guides have 50% say , the panel only has the rest. Plus ur guide can argue to get u better grades or throw down ur grades single handedly, so yes they have the most power, in the end everyone in the panel are their colleagues 🤷‍♂️, they have a understanding among themselves. So if u are in their bad books they will fuck ur grades regardless of whatever miracle u show and the opposite as well"
