    "first year syllabus remains same for everyone irrespective of branch .   \nyou will be divided into either phy or chem in your 1st sem afaik\n└── I downloaded the syllabus for 2025 from the website but it has no physics or chemistry.\n    ├── syllabus online only shows from 3rd sem (2nd year) onwards\n    │   ├── https://preview.redd.it/bdyfb9tt5pkf1.jpeg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7723534ba0b0bcd645ab82877a91c8c6c2633560\n    │   │   └── this is only for python course offered in first sem. other subjects are based upon your cycle\n    │   └── https://preview.redd.it/3eeo1ole6pkf1.jpeg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bafca7f2487252c57cfcb29065937c3e9490dfc\n    │       └── The handbook u have got is seperate department handbook i.e CSE/ CSE AIML.\n\n1st year subjects are mostly handled by Science and Humanities Dept.\n    └── dont worry the syllabus looked same for us back then , the subjects in 1st year is under science and humanities department (except python and  c which is under department of computer science) so they have not included in official  cse/aiml branch syllabus .\n        └── Ok got it. Thanks 👍"
