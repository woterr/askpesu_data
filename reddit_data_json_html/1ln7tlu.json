    "It's like 10th, not as stressful as they make it out to be. A working day is like 8-12pm and 2-3 full days meaning 3 or 4pm\n\nStart studying 1-2 weeks before the exams, that's more than enough for an easy 8.5+ gpa\n├── Ohh thanks 👍🏻\n└── Is it the same case for EC campus\n    ├── It's the same regardless of campus\n    └── Visit campus once and see for yourself. And by visit I mean properly explore\n        └── Are we allowed to go inside the campus if we have the temporary ID card they gave? Also are we allowed to bring someone with us?😭\n            └── I mean nobody really stops anybody from entering or exiting\nSo\n                └── 💀damn alright, thank you :)",
    "3 days 8-1pm 2 days 8-3:30pm, pretty chill, lots of time to chill with friends, study from 1mo before exam for 9+ gpa, 1 week before exam for 8+ gpa.\n└── is this for RR? Any idea how many half days in EC Campus?\n    └── Last sem atleast, ec guys had half the amount of half days as RR had, varies sem by sem, but it's ALWAYS the case that Ec campus has more full days than us\n        └── Ohh thanks 👍🏻",
    "+1 if possible please tell will we be able to take time out to learn something\n└── Yep, if you manage your time properly, you'll have plenty to do other things\n    └── With all the rigours syllabus",
    "i was thinking of joining sports outside the college to pursue since i left it all for jee prep will it be possible to manage that?\n└── Everything is possible as long as you manage your time properly. There is no black/white answer to this, nobody can make a blanket statement and say \"There is no time for anything else at PESU\". If you want to pursue other things, you will need to take time out for it and manage your commitments and priorities. Which means, you will need to compromise on something to get something else. That is not just how PES works, that is how life works.",
