  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\n\n\nI missed the PES University MCA application deadline due to personal circumstances. I’ve already emailed admissions requesting late consideration, but I’m wondering if anyone here has actually been admitted through cancellations, spot admissions, or the waitlist in previous years.\n\n\n\nIf you’ve experienced this or know someone who has:\n\n\\- How responsive was admissions?\n\n\\- What timelines were involved?\n\n\\- Any specific contacts or follow-up methods that worked best?\n\n\n\nAny advice from current students or alumni would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks.\n\n",
