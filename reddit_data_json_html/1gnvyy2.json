The stalls were good (ngl, would have been nice if they were a bit cheaper tho) . The activities were sick as well.   \nThanks to everyone who made Maaya possible. ",

    "The stalls being higher priced is because the event charges those brands rent amount for setting up the table and everything there as well. That's why the food brands have to charge higher than their actual mrp for those same products. But the difference is quite nominal I believe.\n└── yeah it is understandable, just said it would have been nice if they were cheaper.\n    └── Fairs",
