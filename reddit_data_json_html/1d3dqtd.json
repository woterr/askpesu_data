  "content": "Hello everyone, so I’m done with my third year, I’ve completed two summer courses and two courses offered by CIE (L1 and L2) and i have 118 credits now.\n\nI applied for the summer courses now, I paid as well. But a lot of people aren’t paying for it? So am I supposed to pay for it or not?\n\nIf I was in the wrong how do I get a refund? I have made the payment through pesuacademy.\n\nThanks, hope you all have a great week! :)",
