    "7th sem == placements , you wont have time to do anything else. And many people without any experience got good placements without any internship. So yeah try to improve your GPA and DSA skills in 7th sem rather than doing anything else and get a good company through campus.",
    "You can't do an internship in your 7th sem. And your placements begin even before your 7th sem, around July of your final year. Your questions don't add up.\n└── Oh my bad i thought it's compulsory to do a company internship before sitting for placements",
    "No dude. If you have an internship in hand well and good. If you don’t, use the summer to prep for placements.",
    "I mean, u can try to do, as long as u can manage placements, capstone among other things. Altho u wont get any credits from it, maybe u can gain some experience, But generally its suggested not to do in 7th sem\n└── Generally how many companies come during 4th year??  \nAnd at what time do most of them come like is the frequency high during start of 7th sem??\n    └── The best companies all visit in the first 2 months of placements before October basically.\n\nAfter that fewer and worse companies start coming.",
    "It’s better to do irrespective of the curriculum recommends or not. Even Pro bono assignments also helps to gain exposure on real life situations and helps in cracking interviews.\n└── &gt;Pro bono assignments\n\nWhat's that?\n    └── Unpaid work / internships",
    "Do gold sachman comes for internship\n└── they did"
