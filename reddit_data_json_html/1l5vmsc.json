But when I got to know about it, round 1 registration were closed and hence I missed the Round 1 counseling. Now I am panicking because in one of the posts I saw that seats left for CSE is RR campus in 0. I wanted that only. Is there even the slimmest chance of me getting it in round 2? (95.6+ JM)",

    "I am surprised you found PESU interesting /s\n└── yes senior haha. But I'd be thankful if can you please reply me on what chances are about getting CS in 2nd round based on how ranks fell in previous years of PESSAT. Because before 2024 they used to convert merit seats into management quota (as per this subreddit). And also JEE Main Round 5 results will come on July 10 and PES will conduct Round 2 after 15 July (they're taking JEE ranks till 15 July that's why) so will this affect in falling of cutoff?"
