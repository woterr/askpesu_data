    "The rank is based on your total score if I am not wrong. So even though other got mrd maybe you got a score less than them. Cgpa can be same but total score can be different",
    "50+ have got MRD ?",
    "Depends on department, or maybe typo. If department already has many ppl who got awarded, then it might get covered under crn instead of mrd",
    "Skill issue. Go study for advanced bruh",
    "Mard and kinner ?",
    "Congratulations bro!"
