    "The COO said that it's far from the truth and they want to focus on ec campus or smth.",
    "Rr is overcrowded as it is",
    "That'd be crazy...they have to build new classrooms and such and more canteens. Doubt they'd make the switch. If they want to introduce a new stream then they will build.",
    "If it's happening, it's not happening anytime soon. Only the people in the upper management know about stuff like this and if it's close to happening, they would have definitely announced it somewhere",
    "All very valid points. However, I did hear from a couple of sources including from a current student in EC. Fingers crossed !\n├── This was clearly stated as a rumour on sunday\n│   └── Oh. Sounds like it was ruled out categorically.\n└── Whom would it benefit?\n    └── exactly it wouldn't change shit. might make it worse infact, cause rr already has no space."
