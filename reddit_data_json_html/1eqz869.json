    "Are they planning to start college this year?\n└── Nope, they will start as soon 2025 batch graduates",
    "So pretty much guaranteed that college won't start before that",
    "They will keep postponing the date until round 1 of KCET councelling is done. They only started last year in September because KCET councelling got delayed."
