    "Hey could u share the spreadsheet here? I can't find it anywhere\nâ””â”€â”€ https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YZ7HtUcvA9jqWZ04DuwTT66aTV7gU7DUlXyO2BewpII/edit#gid=457632655\n\nHere you go.\n    â””â”€â”€ This spreadsheet is maintained by the students and the numbers are not verified by the official people, so take care.\n        â””â”€â”€ I got it from one of the student. \nTho take care for what ? ðŸ’€\n            â””â”€â”€ for incorrect numbers but I don't think the discrepancy will be more than 5-6%",
    "The market is down from last year. Lot of companies are cutting costs and going through layoffs. And part of cutting costs is reducing the amount and pay of new employees also\nâ””â”€â”€ Still 14 LPA CSE average is impressive\n    â””â”€â”€ Check what's median. Avg is pretty much useless figure\n        â””â”€â”€ Median 12 is still pretty good during recession if out of 800 eligible students 400 people are getting placed with 12 CTC."
