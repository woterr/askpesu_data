  "content": "Pessat exam in my opinioin was very tough today, time crunch is 180q in 180 min which was tough already, and in physics calculations were length(even with using a calculator!). Calculator was slow to use, half of chem quesitons were based on EQUILIBRIUM!, i don't think a single direct formula question came other than the solutions question. I don't know how people finish the paper on time, english they asked many vocabulary questions(defnitions, opposite words), of unheard words, wasn't grammar oriented as  much as other exams. Anyone else faced this problem? How was it for you?",

    "if your paper was tough then congrats.. you will get a good rank\nâ””â”€â”€ Why's that?\n    â””â”€â”€ If you paper happens to be tough, don't worry as others in your batch will be barely able to answer half the paper right. \n\nMost of my friends had no hopes of getting a good rank in this exam, only those who said that managed to get 500-1k rank",
