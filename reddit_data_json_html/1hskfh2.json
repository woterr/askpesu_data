    "I was actually interested at first but now after a couple sems I'm considering farming as an alternative career option.\n├── Bro I'm not Even kidding farming seems like a legit option now\n├── This is very common when it comes to Software Engineers. Many want to consider farming as an alternative career. But you're not even a software engineer yet and have already decided to do this 😂 maybe you're on the right track to become a software engineer then\n├── I wanted to do that when I came to pu 😭\n└── same bro i dont have interest in the science these institutions portray i love plants too i love farming too but dont have enough money to invest in it",
    "I was type 2 when i came in then transitioned to type 1 now back to type 2 after applying for internships.\n└── You would go to type 1 if you do an internship in a SAAS based startup, I can bet on it.",

    "You might find my answer vague but still let me share my opinion. I was a bright student till 10th and passed out from an ICSE school.Had slightly given up after enduring the pressure in High School. Did pretty well in my 12th boards but couldn't get a branch of my choice in Engineering. I'm right now pursuing EEE at PES and not just the branch but the college itself gives me  back to school vibes.Joined clubs to have more exposure to peer groups and be more proactive.Envying my peers who are having a much more relaxed student life at BMS/MSRIT or even RVCE. And yes I was being pressured by my parents since school and felt I'm just studying for their sake.\n└── no its not vague i can relate to u exactly i am in 12th now and scared of not getting good college and good job i somehow want to be financially independent n not be burden to my parents i too feel a lot pressure coz my 12th exams r nearing, yes i relate to u my parents too pressurise me when i look depressed they tell its ok u can score how much ever u can efforts r important and on the result day they make me feel useless i dont trust them\n\ni hope u heal and dget to do  what ur heart really likes to for the sake of urself\n    └── 🤜🤛",
    "I'm in the second category when I'm feeling lazy or lack motivation to do typical coding stuff, and in the first category when I'm ideating or anything I try building works out, even if it's only partially functional.😶‍🌫️",
    "My interest is going home after college, interest is bunking as much as I can, my interest is wanting to skip life till I graduate 🗿\n└── what do u mean by want to skip life till i graduate\n    └── if im speaking in terms of games, i just want these 4 years to be a cutscene which i can skip",
    "Unfortunately most people here (and other Indian colleges) are simply here because of placements. The average Indian does not come from a family with enough financial privilege and power to pursue what they want to, and the only means to a better standard of living is a bigger paycheck. That's why you see most choosing CS (or a derivative) so they can fast-track that process. If something like EEE had been the highest paying branch, everyone would have flocked to that instead.\n\nPeople here only pursue other fields if they're truly interested in it and are confident enough that they can achieve the same goals by doing so, or are in a financially well off position to do so.\n└── There are also people without career plans who default to cs\n    ├── I think they would also default to the first category of people. If someone does not have explicit career plans, the best career plan to choose would be the highest paying one.\n    └── like me",
