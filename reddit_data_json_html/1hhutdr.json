Ever since Joe biden ascended to The presidency my academics have been complete garbage. Now after an abysmal sem 3 I have decided to make the greatest comeback of all time and become the most incredible cs student this college has ever seen. Any advice for sem 4 guys?",

    "screw the slides. screw the teachers. worship the textbook\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Thanks bro, couldn't have studied webtech without your notes. I loved how you distilled so much excess data from the slides into such concise points. I hope to gain that ability one day.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Prolly ending up with a Webtech s just because of your notes\nâ””â”€â”€ On every web tech exam I see so many people studying from your notes near the assessment center , goat ðŸ¥°",
    "don't set your benchmark to be your peers. your aim should be higher, to master the subject. learn by the textbook. guarantee you'll get at least a 9.5",
    "Nice to see you have concepts of a plan, just like trump for his presidency",
    "Study hard for sem 4. Third year is usually pretty tough and most people suffer a dip in GPA. If you can increase your CGPA by a large margin next semester, it'll even out the damage from next year.\nâ””â”€â”€ I mean I fear the damage to my gpa has already been done lol. I want to focus more on extracurriculars, don't want to end up in front of an interviewer and have \"getting a job\" be the #1 reason I'm applying for the company. Though I'm completely lost on how to \"find my craft\" so late in the game.",
