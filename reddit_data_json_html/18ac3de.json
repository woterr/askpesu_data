  "content": "I am currently in the 3rd semester in CSE. I was absent for 3 weeks as I had severe dengue. My attendance is around 60% for all the 5 subjects. So, I got my medical certificate but as per an email from the FAM coordinator, I have got to meet the Chairperson and submit an affidavit  which states that 'from now on, I have to get my attendance above 80% or the University can take disciplinary action'.\n\nAnd now, I got an email stating that I need to attend makeup classes for 1 week.\nCan anyone explain what is this makeup class and why do I have to attend this? My ESA's are at hand and now, they are doing all this.",
