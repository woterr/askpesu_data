  "content": "It's a common question most of you will face, when you see everyone making the same projects by taking datasets from kaggle. So save it for later when you have time or when you reach the question the next time\n\n.Three Important Things When Choosing a Project\n.\n\n\n1. Know Your Stakeholders: \nUnderstand who you're creating the project for. Is it for an institution, a social cause, or a company looking to optimize processes or innovate? Don't use made up problems, be narrow you can't solve massive problems, just a small tiny part of a massive problems. The papers you are asked to use as reference (anything published in last 2 years) those are such examples. Atleast you shall know 3 people who would want to know about your project and it's outcome.\n\n.\n.\n\n\n2. Invest Time and Effort: \nGreat projects aren't built overnight. The students who put dedicated significant time to develop their projects, have shown constantly that persistence pays off. If you think something you can learn from YouTube/Coursera/Udemy and make in 2-3hrs others can do that too. If it's good, you'll have 20 people showing the same thing (right noe. It's RAGs, TinyML etc) but if you spend time, read papers, companies reports to understand their problems, and only focus on a narrow project and improve it by 2-3% overall that's something that youtube can't teach. Making a prototype with custom data is easy, filtering, optinzing, cross examining, validating takes a lot of time but no one can copy it easily \n\n.\n.\n\n\n3. Focus on Real-World Problems: \nAddressing tangible issues and creating solutions that have an impact is crucial. It's not just about adding to your resume; it's about making a difference. Knowing that most of you would be making projects to get internship/scholarship/jobs you need to understand one thing. \nTHEY WILL ALL WANT TO KNOW THE STORY and not the specifications of your hardware and libraries you used. The easiest way to do that is (follow 1&amp;2) show that you have done all the steps. Example, you don't have data, well create it manually Labeled data doesn't grow on trees, it seems daunting but 200-300 image labeling takes a hour or two but that's enough to make a unique project. \nQuestions will always be\n\n\nWhy this problem?\nWhy this approach, and now that other one?\nAny major challanges you faced? How did you overcome this?\nWhat's next?\nAnything unexpect that happened? \nWhat were the failures from this project?\n\n\n\nIf you can't give nice and specific answers to these questions the interviewer gets the following:\n\n1. Didn't actually do the project just copied working code\n\n2. He/She didn't choose the problem, just got a dataset and created an imaginary problem. [MOST COMMON]\n\n2. Learned it from a course/youtube but didn't do anything after that from his side.\n3. Didn't really spend time on it. Corporate engineers are stuck on problems for 20-30-60-100hrs, they want people who can still keep working till they find solution.\n\n\n******** Small Announcement ********\n\nAlso, I’m thrilled to share some amazing news about two PES Students (Currently in 2nd Yr🙊🙊) who I connected over PESIO/Reddit. They've spent the last eight to nine months😅😅, starting in their first year, diligently working on projects that have now been accepted for presentation at 11th International Conference on Business Analytics and Intelligence👏👏 at, IIM Bangalore!🔥🔥 For me the best part is, my first invite from to enter IIM Bangalore was in my 4th Sem (Startup Pitching), feels wonderful when you juniors/students bestest your personal records🥹🥹🥹.\n\nThere are 4-5 more such students (2-3yr from EC and RR) currently working towards their problems, hoping for more wonderful news to come around from their work soon.🤞🤞🤞",

    "Amazing post and congratulations on your conference!!!!\n\nGive it your best and goood luck\n└── Thank you Sir,\nBut it's the efforts of the junior students and they will get to present it at IIMB. PES does have great students now (and in the past 😜)"
