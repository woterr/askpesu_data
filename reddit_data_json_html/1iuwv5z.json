But how long do I keep wishing for someone while never getting the chance to have someone by my side in this absolute rat race? It would be so nice to have a partner to support each other through this student phase and hopefully build a long-term relationship.",

    "If you aren't happy single you'll not be happy in relationships also at a point. Plus having someone as a partner after knowing them for less than a year wont work out always",
    "I found mine when I stopped looking. At a hackathon at PES. Funny story!\n└── Damn, happy for both of you! 😃",
    "Ahhhhhh study. \nAs somebody in their mid/late 20s, I'm realizing that people in their early 20s have more time to \"get lost in the sauce\" and explore what options work for them. As people get older, they have \"lesser time\" to play the field, and start getting more serious about dating and \"settling down\". \n\nAs you get older, you'll realize that your age is a direct function of how real people are with themselves and their intentions.\n└── \"study\" such a useful advice 🤌🏻",
    "Go work on yourself first (get job)  \nshit will happen when it happens as long as you do everything possible within your control\n└── I understand, just wanted to vent it out\n\nI've been working on it, I'm currently interning while juggling between academics and clubs. So it's just a wish that I have that maybe someone joins me in this journey someday and things work out for both of us.\n\nI'll focus on my career too, thanks!",
    "Make an effort. Talk to someone you like. Even if they reject you it's not the end of the world. Always be yourself cause if you pretend to be someone you won't enjoy talking to the person cause you will always have to pretend and it will get irritating after a time(if you say weird ass or outrageous things I've met a few girls who find that fun). Try to become their friend first but keep dropping very subtle hints that you are interested(keep it very subtle or it will get creepy) so you don't get friendzoned. And please for the love of God don't just stick to talking about studies and job and shit ; Diversify your knowledge know a little bit about most things so you could hold a conversation. Try having fun rather than impressing that will happen naturally if you guys have fun.\n\nTip: if you're texting someone never close the conversation. Always leave it open ended so they have to respond to you and that way you can keep the conversation going. Keep in check whether the person is talking to you or just responding to you.",
