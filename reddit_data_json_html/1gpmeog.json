Notice the lawn in front of MRD too :)\n\nYou can catch more glimpses of the old campus from the TAS Instagram page, these are some of the prominent ones: \n1. https://www.instagram.com/p/B0-HWlQDeJl\n2. https://www.instagram.com/p/B1fXfdoD4Ou\n3. https://www.instagram.com/p/BzV9p4WD24v\n\nI've got a lot more pictures in the archive, feel free to DM if anyone wants to see more.

    "Can someone post the campus even before Gjb was started to be constructed?",
    "And i thought \"construction campus\" was relatable now\nâ””â”€â”€ Oh that was definitely true for my batch. Half the campus was a construction zone. We'd even joke that our summer internships would be at the digging site lmao.\n    â””â”€â”€ Our placements were there bro\n        â””â”€â”€ It was ready only in final year, so yes. But most of us had our placements virtually.\n            â””â”€â”€ Ya true true they should've left the campus as it was",
    "I remember these times ðŸ¥¹ðŸ¥¹\n\nMemory Trip",
    "what was there in place of GJBC before ??\nâ””â”€â”€ Trees, smaller buildings for each of the engineering departments"
