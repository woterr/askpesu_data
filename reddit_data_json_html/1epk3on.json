    "You need to keep in mind that RR \"Campus\" and EC \"Campus\" are not just campuses. They are two distinct colleges under the PES University. That is the structure. This means that the EC Campus \"College\" has discretion over such matters.",

    "Ig this is the actual reason for pes rr aiml to have higher cgpa cutoff than pes ec cse\nâ””â”€â”€ Bro nah no way ðŸ˜­\n    â””â”€â”€ Then why does rr aiml has higher cutoff than ec cse.. Are pes people dumbb?ðŸ˜­\n        â”œâ”€â”€ Iirc pes ecity was vtu affiliated until some 2019 or 2020. Then it became autonomous. While one in rr was always autonomous.\n\n\nHow does kea even decide cutoffs for that matter? Always was curious\n\n\nBtwÂ did u know there's a pes mandya?\n        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€  I'm not talking about the kcet cutoffs.. I saw a post in which someone wrote a cmnt saying, rr aiml had a cgpa cutoff of 8.6 whereas ec cse had a cg cutoff of 8.1 for branch change after 1st yr\n        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Is mandya pes good ?? I got it through kcet now should I join ???\n        â””â”€â”€ Check the FAQs\n            â””â”€â”€ Rowlet anna, new dp looks amazing.. \n\nBtw,  I've already read every faq present in this sub ..\n\nI was not talking abt the cet cutoff but the cgpa cutoff\n                â””â”€â”€ Thanks, my friend drew it :) - all credit goes to her.\n                    â””â”€â”€ Girl friend?\n\nAnd why does rr aiml cg cutoff goes higher than ec cse?\n                        â”œâ”€â”€ This has been answered in a previous post by rowlet, check the faqs\n                        â””â”€â”€ No, just friend. \n\nRR tends to have slightly higher cutoffs. More people want to shift to RR for some reason so the cutoff increases.\n                            â””â”€â”€ the reason this year was timetable , CIE(main reason) and same course with a better campus + opportunity ...  \nMany from CSE ECC went to RR AIML ....... just cuz of campus"
