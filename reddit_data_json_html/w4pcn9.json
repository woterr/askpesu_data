    "I don't know about first year, but 6th sem is definitely too much to handle. But the current batches have 5 ISA's and some project component for each subject. So I guess it's going to be hectic from the beginning. If you're willing to give all of your energy and time for college then PES is a great place. However, it's just like school. In fact worse than school in terms of social life. Placements, opportunities and teaching(maybe?) are amazing. Everything else is not that great.\n\nAbout tackling pressure, honestly I just went with the flow. I was very close to dropping out. But I'm glad I stuck through. Just hang in there and rely on your friends, parents and seek support when you need it. \n\nBottomline is that if I were you, I'd probably join either RV, MSRIT or BMS. But that's my opinion. I see all my friends having the time of their lives in such colleges and it feels like we're the only ones having to go through this strenuous schedule. Again, that's what I feel. You might want to ask other's opinions roo. \n\nHave a great day!",
    "Dont procrastinate, manage time and do work deligently. Thats how i tackled pressure, since u are asking.\n└── That’s brilliant, thanks a lot:D"
