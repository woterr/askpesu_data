    "You don't need any knowledge of 11th and 12th; The chemistry hesr is way more simple than pu; \nJust study all the slides and notes properly; Maintain your notes during classes, attend labs properly and do all things related to it on time. If you do all these things you can easily get S grade",
    "thank god I'm gonna join it as lateral entry so i skip all this bs 🙏🏻\n└── It's quite light compared to cbse grade 12 tho lol.Went thru previous yr material of chem and it seems to be quite easy tbh."
