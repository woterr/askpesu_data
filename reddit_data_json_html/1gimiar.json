    "why does pes gatekeep isa pyq??\n├── They want to gatekeep scholarship money\n├── only lame ass colleges like IIT B let their students see PYQs. PES transcends IITs. Didn't you hear Mr. Jawahar?\n├── They want us to actually understand the topics ig, cause honestly in board exams and shit u didn't have to understand shit u could just do like 4-5 pyp and score 80+ easily.\n├── Didn't we have a question bank?\n└── cuz they keep giving the same questions ever year to everyone"
