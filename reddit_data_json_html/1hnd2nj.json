    "maybe drop ur questions first\n└── How are the placements for law graduates at PES? (specifically BBA LLB)\n\nLesser important questions:  \nAre the gyms and basketball courts mostly crowded?  \nHow is the hostel availability?\n    └── the amenities are rarely used, they're mostly empty except maybe the badminton courts and gym during peak hours\n        └── How much do the sports facilities cost?"
