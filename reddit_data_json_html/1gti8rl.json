    "We didn't have a hackathon for DBMS. Why PES be keeping a hackathon for every single course\n├── Us 2nd years have a hackathon for ddco.

I probably can't write a single line of verilog code.\n│   │   └── Neither can most of us lol.

All of this apparently adds to 20 marks, but I feel like for the amount of donkey work they're giving us it should be for 50 marks.\n│   │       └── Yeah even we had all of that except for the Hackathon. We didn't know shit about our DDCO project thankfully the teacher we had was chill af.\n│   └── gg bois\n│       └── gg\n└── Damnnn\nSo this is smtg new introduced this year!",
    "This JOB (Jackfruit,Orange,Banana) problems was a sneak way of fitting hackathon along with project and labs lmao. It seems like they couldn't come to a conclusion as to which two of these three they can put in course so considering they don't give a flying f\\*ck about us they have put all the three 💀\n└── Trust me when I say this,\nBy the time I figured out what exactly these 3 effin fruits mean, half of the sem got over😭",
