  "content": "Hello all I just feel I cant handle this . I have really fucked up my scores and feel so unworthy rn . I put all the efforts and studied for exam but still i could just reach avg. infact below average. I'll be getting around 6 gpa or even lesser . I srsly have no idea what to do people say the 1st sem is easy if i cant do easy one idk what my situation would be in other semester. 6 gpa is rlly fucked up cuz even tho i end up doing my 2nd sem which is c cycle good the cgpa would still be low . I dont feel good about it i just feel like a loser everyone around be are doing so good even tho i put lot of  efforts i just cant reach to that level . Is there any way where you can rewrite a particular subject exam again even tho you have passed it just to improve the scores . i just want to have atleast 8.75+ cgpa by the third year 😭 now its feels practially impossible given that my 2nd yr course is even harder as i heard people saying about it. Ig its over for me 😭😭😭😭. Didnt think i end up this kinda situation in 1st sem itself.",

    "On my way to collect downvotes but here's the harsh truth (which was already mentioned before your semester began and also documented in the FAQs, but I shall reiterate): \n\nAcademics here aren't easy. It's rigorous, tough, hectic and difficult to score well. Exams aren't free passes and will really test your understanding of the concepts. Last minute prep is simply not sufficient, so forget all those college stories of people studying overnight. They are a challenge to most people. And finally, for a high grade point in a course, you have no choice other than doing well in every single component, from assignments to ESAs. And here's the worst part: it's only going to get worse from here.\n\nYou're going to have to put in not just hard work, but consistent hard work. The people who score the highest GPAs are people who put in moderate amounts of effort *throughout* the semester. But before you put in hard work, you need to sit down and figure out why you didn't do well. Analyse your mistakes, introspect what went wrong for you and what changes could have made it better, and what can you change. Find a study pattern that works for you. And once you figure that out, keep working hard. There's no other alternative here. \n\nJudging by the number of \"oops I fucked up\" posts in the last 24 hours, the only thing I can say is that you guys seriously underestimated how difficult the ESAs would be despite the numerous warnings provided and simply didn't put in enough efforts throughout the semester or even at the end to do well. Start taking these seriously. There's only so many more \"I will comeback next sem\" before you reach 6th sem. Beyond that, even if you get a 10 SGPA, the damage has been done. Pull up your socks, get serious about academics, understand that you are lacking somewhere and figure out how you can improve. \n\nGood luck.\n├── no amount of warnings could have prepared us for todays monstrosity\n│   └── Its only going to get tougher.\n├── Yeah I had really underestimated the exams 😭. Thanks for the straight and harsh truth . I still have 2 questions if i end up getting 6 gpa in this sem is it still possible to reach 8.75+ by 6th sem (aiml) .  \nAnd is there any way to increase a particular subject marks by paying and reattempting it is there any system like that in pes?\n│   └── 1. Check the calculator on the FAQs. The second sheet will let you test out different GPA scenarios. \n2. Nope. No improvement exams at PES. Once you pass a course, the grade is final.\n├── No harm in giving a reality check to our juniors. They needed a taste of ESA. Hopefully they would have got it. No matter how hard things go, take it up as a lesson and strive to do better👍🏼👍🏼.\n└── Yeah programming is very easy, but not academics. Don't lose hope, just don't ! There may be a point where you could pick up. I'm still in 12th so I can't really give any advice regarding academics.",
    "It's normal to have a low gpa in the first year; from the second year you will only study CS or AIML and you will also get the hang of how to prepare for PES exams, even though it gets tougher you will figure it out",
    "Guys... Forget about CGPA. If getting placed is your goal, work on your skills. It doesn't matter what CGPA you have you will definitely run into great opportunities whether it is on or off campus. If you are skilled and have great projects you will be better off than all your 8+ CGPA friends with no skills.\n├── Skills matters but top companies cutoff is 8+ CGPA\n It is also imp to maintain the CGPA as well\n│   └── Do they generally cut off at 8cgp of that particular degree or previous education also like puc &amp; 10th??\n└── Well if you don't have enough cgpa you won't even be qualified to apply to any. As the other guy told 8+ will let you apply for a majority. 9 or 9.5+ will let you apply for all.\n\n\nThis is not limited to college you'll see this restriction if you apply outside, a minimum of 7.75 is definitely needed given you have enough skills",
    "Hey there , I passed out in the 2022 batch. I had a similar outlook in the first year after my ESA maths M1 paper. It actually sucked when my smartass friends told me \"ey bro I'll easily get 95 \" it just made it worse. \nYou have to hold on, take breaks when you need them, socialise with those around you. Trust me, it becomes way better in next semesters. You start getting a hang of these things and start scoring better. \n\nI got only 7 in the first year, but my fourth year it went up to 8.7 (I don't remember the exact number). If you spend all your time thinking only about academics, you'll lose out on the experience of a lifetime. \nAll the best, you can DM if you want to discuss",
    "Meanwhile me with 5 cgpa in 4th sem 😎.\nEverything will be fine bro chill. \nThere's destiny and that's god's plan.",
    "The only practical solution to your problem is ( downvote me if u dont like it ) is study more , great CG's are not made by studying a day before or even a week before exams , its just your 1st sem so grind harder next sem onwards , no amount of crying and get back your time now all you can do is work harder in the future and be consistent.\n└── yeah thanks ! but I just cant overcome this . I gave everything made own notes studied through out the study breaks but still couldnt remember things and ends up fucking real bad",
    "me too, bolo chai garam chai garam 😭",
    "Relax, everyone does bad in their first two sems, ur grades usually start to improve when you start studying your branch subjects.\n└── yeah but the score i got for isa1+isa2+iassignment is really trash and this will only get me to range of 50s or lesser so I am really cooked 😭",
    "do your best. a word of advice don't get anything below C and grab all the opportunities as you can even summer internships.",
    "A word of advice: Don't get any grade below a C if you want a gpa above 7. This is something I wish I'd known sooner.",
    "Brother wait till we get our grades, they can't fuck up many people like this, we will be having relative grading don't worry\n├── Oh my sweet summer child, PES absolutely can do it\n│   ├── Darn we getting cooked then 😭 \nThough from what we asked from the teachers and all throughout the semester they're like Quality of students been decrementing post Covid and all and that comparing with seniors our scores are really shit in most aspects 😅 so if they have relative grading it'll be better cus our papers this time was mad bruh for us the PYQs felt easier in level, even of direct senior ones 💀\n│   │   └── &gt;Quality of students been decrementing post Covid and all and that comparing with seniors our scores are really shit\n\nI had posted graphs from my batch's ISA scores on PESU Discord after your final ISA scores were released, go check it out. Yes, you can see that as a batch, we did significantly better, our averages were almost +10 more than yours. \n\nI'd say the main difference between previous batches and yours is that since you all went through the COVID phase during your important school years, most of you got used to studying from quick formats like PPTs which don't often help learn concepts thoroughly and are meant for revision. Most of you are very avoidant of reading the book or preparing thoroughly for an exam and would rather choose a resource that helps you cover the syllabus the quickest rather than a resource that covers the syllabus extensively. \n\nOn the other hand, my batch had to depend on the textbook, notes you write in class and online videos to learn concepts. For most courses at PES (atleast until 4th sem), reading the book and solving the exercises in them became a part of the learning process. During ISA/ESA, you'd see people show up with photocopies of the textbook (which were sold at campus mart) or soft copies on their phone. From my experience, I can say that this led to people having covered 100% of the concepts for the topics they did decide to learn thoroughly, instead of learning everything at the surface level. \n\nOf course: PPTs, lecture notes etc have definitely made life much simpler. Back then if you didn't write notes in class, you were in trouble. Now, a lot of it is spoonfed. I believe that you all need to grow out of this spoonfeeding and go back a few years to how things were done. Read the book, solve the questions, study everything there is on those concepts. Then use the PPTs to revise before tests. It's not about covering the syllabus the quickest. It's about actually learning what's there so you can apply it, something that is especially important for higher semesters.\n│   └── Very unlikely they'll grade so bad. \n\nIn my 3 years it's always decent or extremely inflated. \n\nBut never lower than expected\n│       ├── '27 batch sem 2 they really fucked us over with terrible connection + absolutely no relative grading. the odd semesters have been fine though. everyoene got lower grades than expected in sem 2. i'm worried they'll pull the same shit in sem 4 so can't really even tell anymore, they're highly unpredictable.\n│       ├── Yeah you'll never get lower than expected. They're pretty standard mostly.\n│       └── ohh is it hopefully pes show mercy this time\n└── Hopefully I just pray to got i get somewhere around 6 or 7 I have really low expectations as of now"
