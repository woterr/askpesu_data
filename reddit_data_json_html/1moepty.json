  "content": "I’m in my 3rd semester of engineering, aiming to become a Full Stack Developer and also learn some AI skills. My placements are in 2028.\n\nMoney or time is not a problem — I just want to build the *strongest possible* resume to get hired.\n\nI’m torn between:\n\n1. **one** high-quality Full Stack Development certificate (covers frontend + backend).\n2. **Three separate** certificates — one for Frontend, one for Backend, and one for Full Stack.\n\nSeniors tell me one is enough, but I feel three might show more specialisation.\n\nFrom a recruiter’s perspective, which is better for 2028 placements? Will three look like overkill or like I have more depth?\n\nPlease be honest — I only want to do what will *really* make my resume stand out. Please do help me.",

    "Sorry to break your heart, but certifications are useless. Nobody cares how many certifications you have. No recruiter is going to see one \"high-quality\" certification and get impressed or convinced that you know what it covers, or look at three separate ones and be like \"damn, 3 certifications! this dude knows their shit! Fuck lets hire him already\". \n\nIn the industry, the *only* proof and evidence of your skills is actual hands-on experience working with those skills, and that comes through: internships, work exp (which you obviously cannot have), projects, and research. Show your skills with those, not certifications. The *only* certifications which show proof of skill are ones usually organised by major orgs that require you to pass a timed exam, and once you fail, you have failed the certification exam and can only retry after months (sometimes a year), and also, have an expiry date on it. Those are the only ones that are recognized and valued. If you don't have any of these, you're just adding garbage to your resume instead of filling it with useful stuff.\n\nBuild projects, ones that stand out and aren't the cookie-cutter you see on everyone's resume (Netflix/Instagram/YouTube clone is not a good project by any standards). Get internships, work during the summers so that you enter placement season with actual industry experience. *That* is what will make you stand out, not some Full Stack A-Z certificate.",
    "wonder what the prompt was\n└── rowlet doesn't prompt\n    └── i think he meant OP not rowlet lmao\n        └── RowletLLM time",
    "if ur in 3rd sem, pls focus on DSA and finish a list of qs (blind, striver, neetcode), you'll thank me later. When 4th sem comes along, learn CN and OS with all your heart. tbh thats all you need for placements. do a couple of good projects (one can be ur web tech mini proj, another can be built in hackathon) and you're sorted for a t1 offer",
    "Rowlet is spot on. Certificates don’t really mean a lot.\n\nAdding onto that. The point of doing courses should be to stack up skills and experience and not collecting the certificate at the end. This very approach of doing it for the sake of certifications misses the whole point."
