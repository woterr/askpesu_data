  "content": "just heard that 1st year students wonâ€™t be getting hostel because itâ€™s under renovation ðŸ’€ was this mentioned anywhere before? coz i donâ€™t remember seeing it during admission or counselling. i was expecting hostel in 1st year, but now theyâ€™re just saying it might be available from next year. the worst part is they donâ€™t even have clear info for 2nd year either. like no confirmation, nothing. and pes didnâ€™t even mail or officially inform us about this, i had to call them myself to find out. they keep hyping up placements and discipline and all that, but basic stuff like hostel isnâ€™t even sorted. PGs arenâ€™t the same, and missing out on hostel in first year just feels off",

    "1)The demand for the hostel is high, as the number of seats were being increased every year from the past 3years they weren't able to allocate room for everyone.\n\n2)They block few rooms as buffer for management people and people who join through KCET and has political influence.",
