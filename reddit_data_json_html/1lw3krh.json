    "Bro Once you add the options in that blank white space your options are submitted and you can just update the list by changing the priority number beside the college and then update and download the option entry each time you update for future reference if someone messes up who knows it might be helpful at that time their face recognition isn't working anyway\n└── Bro did you download that payment 750 receipt \nIs it very necessary for admission??\n    └── No I haven't but you can if you want to it's only required for option entry like it's a fee for option entry and once you can enter your options then there is no need for that\n        └── Did you finish your option entry or have you started it??\n            └── Bro iam DCET guy not KCET so our is already done yet they are extending the dates instead of giving us r1 result don't worry both are run by KEA so what applys to me will also apply to you"
