    "Try avoiding them for now in second year.\nIf it gets bad just tell your parents and ask them to come to college and talk with your dept. coordinator. If parents are involved then the administration might take drastic measures. And maybe your class also might change just be present there yourself too.\n\nI hope you get through this man, just reach out for help if it gets worse.\n└── thank you. but if there is a way i can change sections pls lmk. pls send me the mail id of whoever i can contact.\n    └── Contact your Faculty Advisor Mentor (FAM)",
