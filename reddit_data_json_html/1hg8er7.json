    "I wish I had known that the college I’m getting admitted into would become the future IIT Bangalore\n└── On a serious note, I wish I knew how dynamic and unpredictable a university degree could get. Our batch experienced three different grading schemes, and adapting to these constant shifts while maintaining GPA was challenging. It felt like we were part of an experiment, with little consistency to rely on.",
    "I wish I knew ECE is shit in PESU",
    "In part that I would have been better off in another college. \n\nBut if you want a more constructive answer, accounting for commute, it tires you out a lot more than you'd expect and for most Bangaloreans, neither campuses are easy to travel to. I needed an IV at one point because of exhaustion- I was going home, completing work and going back to college the next day with little sleep. However, hostels and PGs aren't really a good idea either if you're in a situation like mine where you're far enough, but not too far to require a hostel.\n\nComing to my next point, sleep is another important factor. Make sure you get 6-7 hours of uninterrupted sleep at the very least.",
    "That There is no iit in Bangalore because there is PESU",
    "That I should not have joined PES",
    "thr academics is actually kinda annoying.\n└── You're crying in 1st sem only huh. Wait it gets worse",
    "not much actually, the seniors on reddit have told all the things already and everything is going as expected.",
    "That first year subjects matter the most for gpa.\n└── Also getting above C in all subjects is a must if we want high cgpa.",
    "That how bad and unstable the management is.",
    "That this is a giant construction site. Was here 19-21. Lot of construction, dust and noise."
