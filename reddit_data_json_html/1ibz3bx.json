  "content": "I used to be a pure vegetarian before joining PES, however one day while I was walking down Sutta Gali with my friends in the lunch break, I saw this man who sells shawarma and he just seemed so cute. I told my friends about this and they told me to go get a shawarma from him just so that I could interact with him. They meant this as a joke since they knew how stern I was about my dietary choices, However, I could not stop thinking about him and so I made up my mind and secretly went and got a shawarma from him. Just to try and talk more to him, I ate the shawarma while talking to him. I absolutely hated the smell, texture and taste of the shawarma but I was determined to do it for him. While talking to him, I discovered that he is not as young as he looks- he has a wife and a child and now I am so confused and heartbroken. I took his meat in my mouth and now I feel like it was all for nothing",
