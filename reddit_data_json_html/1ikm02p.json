    "I went through the same thing in the second semester when I got put in a class with strangers while my friends from first sem got moved to another class. I talked to new people and made friends, what else do you do lmao. Take it as an opportunity to make more friends. Itâ€™s literally just 1 semester. Your sections will change again after 2nd sem anyway.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Nah most of my classmates are in same section. That is why I said I hate them and I need new people. Only very selective people got transferred. I at least want to enjoy my 2nd sem with decent mates.\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ what do you hate so much about them?\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ Just don't like them. Yk there are always some people that don't match your vibe. They do some cringey things which sometimes involve me and it irritates me.\nâ””â”€â”€ Yo atp im also in same situation more friends better for u anyday",
