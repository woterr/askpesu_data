    "3rd sem\n\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1-MSBSYvLJw5fiMKMsPVe9veq5wPQ2ZFP/view?usp=drivesdk\n\n\nCheck this out if u want details.\n└── hey, do you have one which states all subjects for 1st and 2nd sem?\n    └── Haven't got the official one but here you go: \n\n\nfirst yr is divided into 2 cycles\n\nchem cycle - chem is main subject, followed by python, engineering mechanics(11th grade physics kinda), electronics(a basic course), and math-1 (differential calculus)\n\nphy cycle - phy is main subject(quantum physics), followed by C, mechanical engineering and sciences(kinda new), electrical engineering(few of these are 12th physics repeated) and math-2 (integral calculus, probably the hardest for ppl)\na thing to note, python is in semester 1. C in semester 2\npython, c, math1, math2 r the common subs\n\nchem - molecular spectroscopy, electrochem, energy storage devices, functional materials and polymers\npython - basics, functions, gui, object oriented programming\nmechanics - intro to statics, force system and equilibrium, distributed forces, beams and friction\nelectronics - intro, semiconductor diode applications, digital electronics, communication systems and embedded systems\nmath 1 - partial differentiatial equations and its types, beta gamma functions\n\n\nphy - intro to quantum phy, quantum phy applications, magnetism, lasers and dielectrics\nelectrical - dc circuits, single phase ac systems, three phase balanced ac systems, electromagnetism\nmechanical - ic engines, turbines, engineering materials, casting forming and joining, machining and industrial robotic automation\nC - intro to C, sorting algorithms, file handling, functions\nmath 2 - integral calculus, laplace transforms, probability, fourier series n fourier transforms\n        ├── Even I thank u\n        ├── Thanks a bunch\n        └── Thanks a lotttt"
