    "If u want to be a frontend dev , you should know how the backend also works.  \nSo i suggest you try full stack, Build a small Rest API , connect it with a simple frontend(html,css) also works.  \nDont just do till css and leave , learn JS , learn how frontend retrives data and populates it Dynamically.  \nThen choose if you want to be frontend or full stack.\n\nif you want a good project which will keep u occupied for sometime , add in an ai-service(preferrable in flask or FAST API)  to the project as well. build a ML model and keep it in a pickle or any other format and use the ML model in your REST API.\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Thanks for the advice!!üëç",
    "Full Stack is always better in my opinion. I mean, even companies who come for placements often just call the role as SWE and only sometimes i have seen only frontend or only backend being mentioned in the JD. So u might be better learning full stack, but since u just finished 1st year, I would suggest follow a proper roadmap. \n\n[roadmap.sh](http://roadmap.sh) is a nice place to start off. \n\nThis [one](https://hackernoon.com/the-2019-web-developer-roadmap-ab89ac3c380e) is a little old, but see if you can find a more modern one.   \n  \nEssentially, first learn HTML, CSS and JS as those are the fundamental, then u can jump into any frameworks / stack (MERN, PERN etc) of ur choice. \n\nGood luck !",
