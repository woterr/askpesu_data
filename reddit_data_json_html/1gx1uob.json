  "title": "A req to mods: New 'Placements' and 'Capstone' post flair ",
  "content": "These two topics are super popular and frequently discussed here. Adding these flairs would make it easier for us to filter and find relevant information.\n\nCapstone projects are a big deal for the upcoming 4th-semester students as we have capstone from sem 5 and a lot of people are lurking here trying to figure out details about them. Similarly, placements are a hot topic for everyoneâ€”from first-semester students searching \"How to land a job at Google/how to grab a 50+ LPA placement\" to 6th-semester folks asking, \"Will TCS conduct mass hiring this year?\" \n\nI hope you can look into this and come up with a solution for us!",
