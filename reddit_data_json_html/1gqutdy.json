    "Afaik these marks are gonna be reduced to 2.5(for 1unit) and added to esa so yeah if u miss it they are going to give u a zero unless u request the teacher to conduct the test again for u\n└── But for chemistry, aren’t those 10 marks of lab??\n    └── https://preview.redd.it/9a2fgk4e8v0e1.png?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba258c48b5bbf47486ebf8a2f353137b455ba84e\n\nThe breakup for marks is like this"
