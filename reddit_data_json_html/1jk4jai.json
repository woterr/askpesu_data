    "where is this from, and which campus? please mention those when posting these kinda posts\n└── Will do so, my Apologies. This is the Bangalore cafe in RR Campus.",
    "Email it to dean of student affairs if you really have problem.. posting on Reddit ain’t gonna improve the food quality\n└── I get your point, and emailing the dean is definitely the best way to push for actual change. But discussing it here also helps raise awareness among students, which might encourage more people to report similar issues.\n    ├── What’s the use.. where else do you think people will go to have food? No matter what it won’t help..\n    └── Inform the dean, he will surely push raise this issue further and try to get it resolved.",

    "You don't need to eat that. Get another...or take it out and eat the rest\n└── The issue isn’t just about that one plate of idli, but the overall hygiene of our canteen. If insects are found in the food, it points to a bigger problem that needs to be addressed. Ignoring it or just taking it out doesn’t solve the issue.\n    └── Complaining on reddit doesn't either...you need to contact the person incharge of making food. And then there's no guarantee that they would listen to students."
