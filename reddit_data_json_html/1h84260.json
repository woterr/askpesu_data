    "lmao tell them about Apple 40 and let them lose their minds ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Damn it's 40 now? Insane xD\n\nik a couple people who got after the first 20 but didn't think it was so many.\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Do you know how much CGPA cut off they kept for diff roles? SWE, IS&amp;T etc.?\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ 9+\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Wait apple seriously came?? That's crazy\nâ””â”€â”€ insane, how much did they offer?\n    â”œâ”€â”€ 90k stipend for internship no clue about fte\n    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Ahh okay\n    â””â”€â”€ 64 LPA is CTC\nbut base is not that crazy, 18 or so I believe.\n        â””â”€â”€ Still bhai 40 people getting 64 lpa is insane, are you sure this happened? As in were there 40 openings or did they offer 64 lpa to 40 people? If it were true then it would have been all over the news by now\n            â”œâ”€â”€ ik of at least 23 people who got this offer, so yes good chance it happened for 40\nAlso I believe Apple has some kind of non-disclosure thing for recruitments in PESU, they donâ€™t let the students publicly announce the offer and also PESU is not allowed to mention it for advertisement purposes. Probably this is the reason there isnâ€™t much news.\n            â””â”€â”€ Its 100% ture i know 20+ people personally who got the offer. And yes they took 40 people in total.\n                â””â”€â”€ Won't this alone bump your average up by an insane amount? Do uk what the average package is currently?",
