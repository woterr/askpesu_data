  "title": "[Rant] Dude, You’re an Unpaid Intern",
  "content": "**Disclaimer:** First off, I’m genuinely proud of everyone doing summer internships in college labs. It’s a great way to spend your time, and even better if you’re getting opportunities learning something useful, and even if you aren't, its still way better than staying at home and wasting away your youth.\n\nBut let’s get one thing straight, the reason these internships exist (aside from credits) is to *give you* an opportunity to learn.\n\n**Newsflash:** You’re not saving the world.\n\nThe lab isn’t handing some second-year intern a task like *“Find the cure for cancer.”* Most of the time, you’re doing work they could’ve figured out themselves. Yeah, some labs have vetting processes, because obviously, they want people who are *actually interested*, not just applying for the sake of it.\n\nHere’s the thing: **Getting into a lab isn’t an achievement.** Being part of your favorite lab doesn’t make you better than anyone else.\n\nAnd yet, I’ve met people (especially from *one specific lab,* you know who you are) walking around like they’ve got a Nobel Prize in their back pocket. The god complex is unreal.\n\n*Dude, you’re an* **unpaid** *intern.* Your lab isn’t changing the world, you’re basically doing digital cotton-picking.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, if you love your internship, that’s awesome! But there’s **zero** need to be a dick about it.\n\nAnd even if you *were* curing cancer in your lab, that **still** wouldn’t justify the **sheer ego** some of y’all carry around.\n\nThis isn’t me hating on internships, it’s me hating on the obnoxious superiority complex that comes with it.\n\nStay humble, Take care.  \n**I love you** 💙",

    "There are few scammers in these internships too, completely get their work done from AI and then fail to explain basic things from it. More or less if you rely too much on ai without seeing internship as an opportunity to learn, you are definitely doomed",
    "I feel like a little less of a god complex from everyone involved here would be amazing, because even paid internships at the largest companies won't give second years very fancy projects - you'll most likely be doing what Indian IT folks disparagingly call \"DevOps\" (deploying shit, running scripts that were written 45 years ago, fixing the smallest of small bugs). \n\nPoint being, if people wanna show off the 9 lines of Python they wrote at their summer lab internship that converts one column of a CSV to something else, let them :)\n└── The Lord has spoken 🙂‍↕️",

Or like in an ambiguous way\n└── Because I am in ECE, and there are certain dicks in my team as well who do exploit me because I am a junior dev and there is psyop buildup most of the time.\n\nNot that I am complaining, but just stating the reality.\nDid get to learn a lot, that's for sure.",
