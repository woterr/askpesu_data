    "It's completely false info, you can get a specialisation certificate issued from the CSE department if you complete all the electives in a single domain from CSE\n└── https://preview.redd.it/jgm2qsh14tif1.jpeg?width=1056&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ddc4999afd27d8d8ea275e3243ca0ef4dda44ced\n\nFrom a senior\n    └── The first batch of aiml is not yet graduated; So it's too early to believe in such promises; Generally that's not the case. The departments are different hence the degree will be different too; It's not a sub branch, it's entirely a new branch; Specialisation certificate and degree have a lot of difference.\nAnd taking a elective from CSE and getting a degree in CSE are 2 different things; It will definitely be mentioned as CSE-AIML in the degree not cse.",
    "NOO let me clarify , we will get the degree as CSE(AIML) but we will have learnt all the things the cse ppl have , indirectly yes but formally it will be still a \"CSE AIML\" degree"
