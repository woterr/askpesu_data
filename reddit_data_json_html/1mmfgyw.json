  "content": "Hey so there is this retest for a company (Vyapaar) tomorrow and their shortlist came this morning. The retest is getting conducted because most people lost internet connection in GJBC auditorium. Whoever appeared for the test had the option to give a retest. I chose to give retest. Now in the retest list my name is missing. I tried contacting Somashekhar Sir and Animesh Sir through WhatsApp and gmail but no response till now (prolly bcz it's Sunday). Any idea what should I do now because the retest is there in tomorrow afternoon..",
