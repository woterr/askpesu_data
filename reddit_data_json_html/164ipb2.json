Take ur time, have fun and don't worry about this stuff.\n└── but alot of seniors said that friend groups finish forming in bootstrap and it's harder to talk to new people once classes start?\n    ├── Lol no. I have spoken to people I met in my bootstrap since my bootstrap ended. All my friends came from classroom interactions. Chill, you have 4 years to make college friends.\n    └── Not at all true. I found my best friends in class only.",

I understand though I don't know how to initiate a convo with a guy too. I introduce myself convo ends and then it's awkward\n    ├── Half of my conversations end after where are you from🤣\n    │   └── Mine end at what department are you from and most reply cse\n    │       ├── I have stopped asking that ever simple the first day\n    │       ├── Relatable\n    │       └── So true\n    └── Your advise worked I spoke to a lot of girls.
