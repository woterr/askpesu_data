I’m ready to learn both areas, but I’m worried about not doing well during placements if I focus on these two interests. I haven't started studying DSA yet, but I plan to learn Java for DSA. Can you give me advice on what to focus on in my 3rd year to improve my chances of getting placed without any issues?\n",
