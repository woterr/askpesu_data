    "As a student, I don’t think you should lock yourself to a desktop just yet. \nAlso if your current laptop is working just fine for your use cases, hold on to it.\nAs the year progresses and you get more of an idea of what you’ll be doing and needing, you could revisit this discussion.\n└── Okay thankss",
    "Until 2nd year you would just do basic programming. So your old laptop should do good.\n\nPro tip- have an old hardware? Add Linux dual boot.\n└── righttt...thankss...since ur in 4th year, I wanna ask u this...\n1)is there any heavy software that is to be used in college during classes which demands high specs.\n2)and abt the capstone, does it have to be dealt with in the college itself? Just to get an idea of the process.\n    └── 1) as of 1st year nothing is required. Maybe in higher sems there might be software that demands performance.\n\n2) yes within college itself, will fetch you marks and credits.\n        └── alrightt....thankss",
    "I'd suggest you to get a better laptop mate cuz in Computer Networks labs (4th sem) you will be asked to do assignments in class manier times where the assignment involves working with a VM or multiple VMs.. For that you will atleast need a i5 system with 8gb ram or 16gb ram (recommended). An i3 would struggle badly to run all this with limited number of underpowered cores+threads.\n\n\nIt will help you with your ML assignments too which sometimes you have to submit during lab hours. Better to go with a laptop with better specs imho.\n└── Ohhhh ...okayyy...thanks mann\n    └── No problem\n        └── No problem",
    "The new Mac mini is a great investment, you should definitely consider picking it up if you need a new system, your current laptop should be fine for whatever first and second year throw at you.\n└── Okayy, thankss"
