You can try asking them, but might not work out. In the past when there weren't any delayed semesters and the session used to religiously start in the first week of Jan and end by mid/3rd week of May, kids used to still apply or at most miss a week of the internship. Maybe you can even contact the organisers of the internships to be a little flexible.\n\nRegardless, you should still apply. You can always plan on crossing this bridge when you come to it. Don't hold yourself back from applying to positions because of future potential problems. \n\nNote: For others who are unaware, a couple of IITs, IIITs etc organise summer research fellowships for undergraduate students. These are purely research focused and last for 2 months on their campus. They are brilliant opportunities for you all, and they open registrations every year between Feb to March. Here are some of the ones I came across last year (you will need to hunt for more, this is a starter list):\n\n* [https://www.iiitd.ac.in/placement/summer-internships](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/placement/summer-internships)\n* [https://academics.iitd.ac.in/srf/](https://academics.iitd.ac.in/srf/)\n* [https://surge.iitk.ac.in/dates.php](https://surge.iitk.ac.in/dates.php)\n* [https://sun.iitpkd.ac.in/](https://sun.iitpkd.ac.in/) \n* [https://srip.iitgn.ac.in/info/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/SRIP-23012024.pdf](https://srip.iitgn.ac.in/info/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/SRIP-23012024.pdf)\n* [https://sfp.iitm.ac.in/](https://sfp.iitm.ac.in/)\n└── Thank you!!!"
