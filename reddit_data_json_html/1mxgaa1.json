  "content": "\n\nSince the KEA messed up the 3rd round, my plans are now shattered.\n My only options now are \n\nPES ECITY CSE, \nBMS, AIML, \nBMS, iot cyber \nBms CS DS. (I might not get it, read the full post.)\n\n Should I take BMS AIML? I think it's a very low branch; it's very different and it's BMS, so should I avoid it?\n\nMAIN QUESTION\n\n Since CSDS seats have increased by 60, and last year's cutoff for my category was 4713, will I get it in the 2nd round? My rank is 5.1k. Is a 400-rank jump possible, considering not many people are considering bms nowadays?\n\n If so, should I consider it above PES EC CSE? Is it better or worse? less\n\n\nConsider BMS because the cllg life is better there a lot of events are happening and yeah it's not good at placements compared to pes but not bad either and will it be a big mistake is I take BMS ? Since I am comparing it to pes ec campus so yeah please seniors guide meðŸ¥² ",
