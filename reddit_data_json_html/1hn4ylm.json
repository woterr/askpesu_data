    "Whats is the point of giving holiday when students already (travelled 30 km and) reached college 🤦‍♂️",
    "I decided to skip first period because I woke up late, god intervened and saved me so much money for the travelling (i live 33kms from ecc) 🙏\n└── Brother, don't you have a bus pass? Costs abt 1830 per year\n    └── I come by bike\n        └── is it not tiring?\n            └── Since it's thru nice road, it's not tiring at all, takes me max 45 ish mins, and I enjoy the ride. No traffic encounter whatsoever.\n                └── ouhh nice. I can't imagine travelling 20km on outer ring road and not be tired 💀\n                    └── Fr💀, the alternative is to come thru main road(I live near rr campus and travel to ecc), it's only 20kms but costs more than nice because of the shit mileage I'll get in traffic. \n\nAnd the stress, my god. Nice is a godsend.",
    "That's great. Now I am gonna travel 25km back to home😃👍🏼👍🏼.\n└── 4th year ppl have classes?\n    └── Nope. I had other work in college.",
    "Typical pes at its peak",
    "There is still hope for humanity\n└── But what's the point when they post this at 8 am when everyone's already reached college lol.\n    └── Enjoy it while it lasts, there will come a time when you will miss going to college\n        ├── I'm not a first year but alr I see your point\n        └── Listen bro, respectfully, you're wrong. Nobody is gonna miss the shitty education system after they pass out. The memories we made with friends? Sure. The stress of placements, exams, assignments, attendance. Who the fuck in their right mind will like that shit.\n            └── Come back and read this message after you spend 6-7 months in the corporate world\n                └── Mhmmm capitalism",
    "Lol\nAs always :)",
