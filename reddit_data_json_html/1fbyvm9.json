    "As far as I heard from seniors they don't have bootstrap but idk about orientation",
    "you will have a seperate orientation but no bootstrap\n└── Oh ok, thanks!",
    "If you get admission after college has started for pessat ppl, you won't really have bootstrap or any other formal event, you'll have like a small orientation and classes will start immediately. You'll join very close to the first internals so classes will also be rushed\n└── Oh ok, thank you."
