    "You can use fee receipt pic in some places, like lenovo uses sheerID and sheerID accepts receipt.\n\nPesu will will provide an ms 365 email id for using with teams, you can use this email id to claim student discount coupon on dell\n└── that will work on unidays too right?",
    "Fuck student ID - I couldn't sign up for Infosys instep or any internship programs(just finished first year)\n\nI actually lost an offer cause I couldn't verify with email (it was a company mandated system)  \nPES is actually ridiculous on this regard"
