    "Maybe yes :)\n\nTBH it might get tough!",
    "Society just needs a re set. Way too many requirements other than skills\nâ””â”€â”€ THIS !! I got rejected from an ML club of this college despite knowing basic ML but for being non-cse\n    â””â”€â”€ That's really stupid which club?",
    "Man college placements feel like a scam , 95% board requirement , that too 10th standard. I understand the need for a cgpa requirement but the teaching at pes is subpar and trash , most courses suck ass and the only way you can get a good grade is by glucking down the slides. Sometimes even the slides and notes are fucking trash and incomplete.\nAtleast VIT has a proper resource system\nâ”œâ”€â”€ i completely agree. im paying you 4 lakh a year, the least you could do is employ decent teachers. \n\nthe only redeeming quality of this college are its CSE placements; remove that, and it becomes nothing but a dystopia.\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Exactly. I don't know what'll happen to this place in ten years , it's surely leaning towards becoming VIT instead of IIT.\n\nAtleast VIT knows it's worth.\nâ””â”€â”€ but the syllabus of pes is betetr right and not outdated? Just asking\n    â”œâ”€â”€ It's up to date but out of order.\n    â””â”€â”€ The syllabus is better, but the execution is really bad. It used to be 5 units , now it's 4 and it's all messed up and most profs are crap.\n\nBasically, the effort is you and you only , which you can literally do in any other college. There are some good opportunities that pes gives ofc , but the management seems to fucking all of that over in favour of making more money \n\nThis place massively fell off man , anti club rules , shitty HODs and whatnot",
    "If that's the case, I'm cooked\nâ”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ˜¢\nâ””â”€â”€ me too",
    "And they say 12th and 10th doesn't matter!!  kids never listen to those people, give your compartment/improvement exams.",
    "im cooked",
    "Only pcmc or including English kannada ??",
    "is this only pes or is this how every college works? if its other colleges too im cooked\nâ””â”€â”€ It's being seen in most colleges now, it's cutthroat everywhere.\n    â””â”€â”€ i hope they dont see my 12th marks",
    "95% what about the rest of us who don't score that much. What a world we live in.",
    "For entry perhaps but overall most would look like jobs in crossover or [turing.com](http://turing.com)"
