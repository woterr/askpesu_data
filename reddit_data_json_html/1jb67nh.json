    "Tbf its good they have banned \"playing\" open holi inside campus...... Many people don't like being thrown colors and water on\n\n  \nBut yea, they shoulda given a holiday atleast\n├── They should have designated a small area on campus to play, in EC they could have use the place btw MRD and the Hospital.  \nI dont think we can ask for holiday, most schools and colleges in blr don't give holiday either.\n└── I agree with this bt allowing to play holi obviously doesn't make it compulsory for everyone to play..! Rest of the ppl shld enjoy holiday..\n    └── What holiday? 😭",
