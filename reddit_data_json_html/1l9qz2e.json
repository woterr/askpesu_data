    "yeah mostly u will\n├── But many members say that you won't get it!!\n└── And they say it as risky........ I don't understand what is risk in it....\n    ├── See you have to take the seat u get alloted in 3rd round or else pay a penalty very huge sum.... so it's risky if u don't get pes clg ,u have to go to other college no other choice or take a chance at not being alloted a college\n    │   └── There is no penalty in kcet\n    │       └── there is,4 yrs of kcet fees u gotta pay to the kea board, incase u don't want the seat allotted in 2nd ext. round\n    └── well its only a risk if the college allotted in the 2nd round is something which you badly don't want ,else you are set, no risk at all with you just testing your luck in the next round, and also cut offs mostly increase for all the colleges in 3rd round except few branches of rv and pes rr"
