    "Easier in bms, working smart will easily get you 9+",
    "It's easier to score better grades in any VTU college (including BMS) than it is PES",
    "Anywhere in the world over PES imo\nâ””â”€â”€ nah, IIITs and BITs are also hard af  \nEven places like vit are pretty hard",
    "BMS , unlike PES where u have only 2 isaâ€™s and are tough compared to other clgs\nâ””â”€â”€ + if you screw up one ISA your overall score dips because each contributes to 20-25% of your overall grade.",
    "Bms",
    "If you get 9 gpa in BMS it means you will get a 7.7 gpa in PES. To sum up BMS is easier\nâ””â”€â”€ Do you get study holidays before final sem exam in first year at BMSCE? I'm a PESITian, and we just got 5 days prep time for finals and just a day gap for each subject ðŸ˜ž? How's it in BMS?",
    "bro pes is a straight up school now if you wanna relive that trauma go for it\nâ””â”€â”€ Are u graduated in pes? What branch",
    "if u have a dream of scoring 9+ CGPA in collage like PES. u really concentrate or work on ur extra skills or passion is impossible they torture u more. every week u have labs record or any asssinment and many more. u have to be really strong to be pes specially in exam weeks................."
