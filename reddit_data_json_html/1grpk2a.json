    "Free 10 marks just attend and write whatever the heck uk\nâ””â”€â”€ Wtf they won't evaluate?? Cuz I fcked up mechanics assessment ðŸ’€\n    â””â”€â”€ They *do* evaluate. What u/RamanaGad implies is that the assessments/assignments/etc components are often a straightforward and low-effort way to get 10 marks, compared to ISAs which are 40 marks and ESA which is 100. When everything adds to your GPA, it is important to maximise marks wherever possible, especially in low-effort deliverables like these because it helps bump up your overall grade.\n        â””â”€â”€ Aight,got it tq for the reply :)",
    "Imo it depends on prof totally. Some profs are damn chill and u can easily get 9/10. But others are picky, they grade each assignment and give it a weightage. Some will give u a shit ton of work for those 10 marks (like some of mine are currently haha) . All in all, finish as much as u can and put in minimum effort, those 10 marks will come handy in case u mess up a few questions during ISA.",
    "It completely depends on your respective teacher,\nLike if they are chill they will give 9/10 for every one unless you are not targeted by them.\n\nAlso u can consider for a retest if you have missed any test by chance ."
