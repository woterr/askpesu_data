  "content": "Hey guys,  \nNeed help choosing between Harvard CSE and PES University CSE.\n\nI got into both because, you know, JEE 😎. Fees are kind of similar if you ignore exchange rates, cost of living, and reality. I just want to know which one is better for placements, campus life, and food quality in the mess.\n\nAlso, I heard Harvard doesn't have as many technical clubs as PES. Is that true? 😬  \nPlease don't be biased. I want facts only.\n\nPS- I have 97.8X percentile in JEE, so obviously I'm qualified to judge Harvard.\n\nThanks in advance! 🙏",
