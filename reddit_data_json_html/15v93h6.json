  "content": "Hello, I'm a 2021 BTech CSE graduate and would be applying for masters for Fall'24. \n\nI met one of the Prof in-person today and he's ready to give LoR. \n\nBut, he told that the CSE Dept is not giving out official letterheads anymore. So, they would be uploading the LoR without using the PESU letterhead. \n\nBut, some unis have mentioned that they will not accept LoRs without letterheads.\n\nSo, I would appreciate if someone can help me on what to do ?
