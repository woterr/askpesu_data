    "What's this for, give some context lol\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Cs lab staff asked us to write 8 crazy ideas we can think of using \"C\" and then they sorted us into  groups of 4 people randomly and asked us to complete one project out of the 32 projects by the end of the sem. I think they are making us ready for capstone as i heard here and there that some or more seniors are doing some bs projects and are claiming it to be their capstone project or not having motivation to do it. Or they might be cooking something and are experimenting on us.\nOr they might earn off of us if we make something cool ðŸ˜‚\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ But i strongly think they will start making us ready to capstone from this sem\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ Yeah thats what i wanted to say this is 100% likely to be true\nâ””â”€â”€ apparently to come up with a new idea (inspired by cmu) and google does it",
