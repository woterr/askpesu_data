    "PES used to have foreign language classes over the summer. They stopped when COVID hit. I know many people who signed up for German because they would be applying to German Unis for Masters.\nâ””â”€â”€ thats acc so cool ngl.\n    â””â”€â”€ Yeah the classes were decent for the low cost (as per their feedback), but you don't learn too much beyond being familiar with a limited vocabulary. That's pretty much all the info I've got about these classes.\n        â””â”€â”€ So it's not good enough incase u want a B2-C1 certificate? I don't wanna bomb my money as I already got some courses, but I'm too unmotivated to start, so I thought this could kick start the motivation.Â \n            â””â”€â”€ I'm not that aware of the language requirements for MS in Germany. All I know is, some friends of mine signed up for it in the summer of 2019 and they found it okay for the price but not too useful.\n\nEdit: Just realised summer of 2019 was almost 6 years ago (*internal screaming intensifies*)\n                â””â”€â”€ It depends on the uni and course but it's recommended to have until atleast B2 so u can easily navigate German life and get a part time job if u want. Visa required A1-A2. Working in higher end technical jobs requires C1.Â ",
