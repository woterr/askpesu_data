    "You could tell you have club activities or something, no?\nâ””â”€â”€ oh yeah this makes sense tysm ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­&lt;3",
    "Probably yes , but you can edit the timetable pdf the college sends and try to gaslight them or say you have club activities\nâ””â”€â”€ BAHAHA thats what i had in my mind tbh until i remembered pes wants to involve parents in everything : |\n    â”œâ”€â”€ Not really, just empty threats dw.\n    â”œâ”€â”€ Actually they don't. My parents know nothing of what happens in college\n    â””â”€â”€ Chill , my parents don't know isa's exist and I'm in third year , i only tell them my final sem marks lmao",
    "Who wants to stay in clg da\nâ””â”€â”€ I think its mainly about OP not wanting to go home rather than staying inside college lol\n    â””â”€â”€ Aah lol, makes senseÂ ",
    "Parent here. I can see the timetable.\n\nWhy fake ? You can explain to your mother what you want to do on the days with half day. \n\nHonesty is the best policy. If you break her trust now, she will definitely micro manage you over the years.\n\nMoreover, parents have other parents in touch. If you fake it, we get to know from elsewhere. We have pes groups too. Things are discussed. Messages are written to jawahar too. Everything is very transparent.\n\nMany of us are on reddit too.\nâ””â”€â”€ makes sense, thankyou for your comment. it is hard to communicate with my parents and sometimes its easier to resort to other methods ðŸ˜”\n    â””â”€â”€ It's important for one to be authentic even if it makes others uncomfortable. You are an adult and so are they. You can respectfully talk to them and assure them you aren't doing anything that will cause harm. Make sure your grades are good. Sooner or later they will trust you more and they will give you the freedom you need. Your relationship with them will also improve tremendously overtime.\n\nHome must be a place where one can feel vulnerable. As adults, you all can sit and discuss the pros and cons and take the best of the discussion and adhere to it.\n\nChildren nowadays are living dual lives and  overtime, they become confused who they really are. Best is to avoid this route as it can result in personality disorders and may need psychiatrist intervention to correct it.",
    "whats the point of lying about this? Just say u wanna stay back in campus for a while\nâ””â”€â”€ you clearly do not have experience with strict parents so im not going to answer your question\n    â”œâ”€â”€ Honestly, just tell them you are trying to work with some profs and you have meetings with them after classes (that is anyway when these tend to happen). *Back in my time*, there wasn't any \"parents app\", but if the same timetable renders on both apps, there isn't anything you can do. Just be smart about it and come up with a solid excuse. If you cannot say working with profs, there are a bunch of other excuses from clubs to fests.\n    â”œâ”€â”€ I have strict parents but after a certain point u shud have made it clear to them that u want to do stuff and not tell them everything u do. My parents have eased up on me since I turned 18 cuz they know they can't keep controlling everything I do. U can try and persuade them , prolly take help frm ur older siblings who can relate\n    â”œâ”€â”€ ye but lying is a time bomb waiting to explode. God forbid they find out, they sure as shit wont think you stayed back to attend club meetings.\n    â””â”€â”€ there is nothing to help here tbh. just tell u have some work or something and move on. Done."
