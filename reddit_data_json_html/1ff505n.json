    "Probably because most of the queries are already already answered by seniors and we just have to search them up for answers\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ As far as I know the CIE question which the person asked hasn't been answered\n    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CIE was not a mandatory course until now,so the amnt of ppl who took it in the past were less and among them those who r in pesu sub might be even less and then among them those who r active on this sub? Ig they just don't exist..",
    "I usually try to answer whatever I can, but life has kept me occupied lately. I'll try to get back to some of the questions when I do find the time.",
    "i would imagine thats cause a lot of people are familiar with all the freshers stuff. But on the other hand, when it comes to some of the education related querries, the reason they dont get as many responses is cause a lot of people dont know much about them or feel like theyre not qualified enough to answer them.\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Makes sense"
