    "Locking this thread. The last week has seen at least 3 posts with the same template: \"I have X GPA, will I have issues during placements\". The placement stats spreadsheets from the last 4 years are public and are on this subreddit. Go through them, look at the cutoffs for assessments and interviews and make an informed decision about where you stand. \n\nDo not spam the same content multiple times. Future posts like these will be promptly deleted.",
