Basically I have fucked up my 75% criteria by a bit and I don't feel giving improvement is worth it cuz I ain't no prodigy I am a mediocre student I know I am not gonna get anything above 97%ile for which pesu is best imo and if I do well I have nsut dtu IIITB so imo giving improvement wasnt too ideal. Since I have very limited options from last 3-4 days I have been very worried about the counselling process thinking in mind that I'll do well in jee but fuck up the counselling process.\n\nI tried searching for any post related to pesu jee counselling process but couldn't find any detailed post listing the procress so I just wanted to know the counselling process for btech admissions via jee route.\n\nThanks in advance 🙏❤️",

    " i think they will release a rank list based off your jee mains crl, after which you choose your preferred branch/campus through the jee main admission preference list &amp; then they conduct counselling (in person). there might be some more steps to it, that i'm not sure of, but this is the gist of it.\n├── When does the process start typically?\n│   └── around may june ig? not sure really but it starts after advance is over ig\n└── Is whole counselling process which is done offline completed in a day?\n    └── yes. you select ur branch n campus based on availability and pay as welll. there will be 2 rounds of counselling usually but i'm not sure if the ranks drop by a lot in the 2nd round\n        └── Oh",
    "Counselling starts around June, there were 2 rounds this year. Each round happens in 1 day, 1st happened in June, 2nd took place in July. You get called based on your pesu-jee rank, like for us it was rank 1-1500 at 8am, 1500-3000 10am, 3000-5000 2pm type thing, and the offline counselling finishes in a day\n└── If I am outside Karnataka student then can I select offline counselling or do I have to compulsarily go in online counseling if there is any? And when does the application process start typically? Is the counselling for both the campuses done at the rr campus?\n    └── Yes, I believe you can select offline counselling. Not sure, but I think that is default; you have to choose if going online.\nApplication for counselling? May end, I think.\nYes, counselling for both campuses is done at RR.\n        ├── Thanks bhai\n        └── Btw if I had to compulsarily opt for online counseling if they don't give offline counselling for non karnataka students, is online counseling if pes smooth?"
