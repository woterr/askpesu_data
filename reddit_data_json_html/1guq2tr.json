    "HP has arguably the best course syllabus and high quality assignments and project which is relevant for industry. DBT is alright but imo the syllabus could be better. I would say HP is the better course but take based on interest- if you liked DBMS internals(last part of DBMS course) maybe DBT. If you like MPCA or OS(not how it's taught here- PESU's OS course is horrible- but the subject/topics themselves) then HP for sure."
