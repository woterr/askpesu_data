    "Unrelated: Speaking from experience.Be careful when you are out there roaming alone midnight\n└── what happened?\n    ├── Sutta gali ghost\n    │   └── LORE!!!\n    └── Umm so many things. I experienced something very weird like as u go deep into the opp side of the pes university (opp side of sutta gully) at night u won't get network properly despite being &lt;1km far from the college and even gps doesn't work there and that area is creepy as fuck with no proper roads and hardly any people outside \n\nFor friend 1: A gay guy came and asked him whether he could suck his dick.He was followed for a long time before he reached pg and locked himself\n\nFriend 2: His mobile was stolen while he was walking on the road by some auto ppl,they dragged him along for a distance cause he didn't leave phone from his hand.\n\nFriend 3: He went out at 2am+ to buy medicine, the cops called him (It was election time and there was a checkpost near pesu) and advised him not to come out alone in this area late night.\n\nAnd many more..",
    "Most of the sutta gully shops close by 11, stack up some noodles or chips in your room",
