    "Too many fouls , too much hating on the other teams and too much physical violence. These guys were legit too much during the whole tournament, during the football match when one of their players got accidentally fouled by a cs guy over 20 nursing students went and almost beat up the guy who fouled , the bouncers and the ref had to come and clear it up , during a match against aiml dept theses guys straight up were harassing the other players outside the field . Foul play and slander are common in sports but there should be limits for that too.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Yoo when did this happen\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ 2-3 weeks ago ig?Â \nâ””â”€â”€ Too many sweats ðŸ˜”",
