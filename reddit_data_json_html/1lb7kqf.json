    "If text and speech is a rebranded NLP course - search this subreddit. It's been discussed in previous years. As for DA, again, search - there are at least 10 posts about this almost every single year, many by me.\n└── Okayy thanks i just couldn't find any info on NLP",
    "So it is same as NLP right? Can someone confirm that?\n└── Yeah they have the same coursework"
