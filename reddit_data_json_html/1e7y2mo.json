    "They have spoken with their experience no one is hate-mongering at this college. Once you join this place you'll get to experience college life on your own. So don't get bothered by the comments.",
    "PES is more academically oriented than other colleges in the city. So, when you see people saying they \"miss out\" they're probably referring to that fact.\n\nMany kids come here expecting a Karan Johar movie college experience with fun and parties but get that out of your head. You will get to have *some* fun, but you will also have to study and put in a lot of extra effort. In the end, your college experience depends only on you.",

    "Personally, I think PES kinda feels like a jail, especially in EC campus (I can't speak for RR). There are bouncers around everywhere, you can't sit in the canteen outside break hours and if you're caught bunking, you will be taken your HoD.  What other college has stupid shit like that lol. There aren't many club or extracurricular activities and the management definitely doesn't give a shit about all that. It's become pretty clear to us in the last year that the management doesn't really care much about the students or their well-being and it does feel that way. But if you have good friends and you want to have fun in college, that's completely doable. i had a lot of fun with my friends in college, but everyone has a different experience and  it's all about what you make of it. But when it comes to the clg itself, PES sucks when compared to how chill and fun most other colleges in Bangalore are",
    "Hey , it completely depends on person to person and their experiences , but if you pretty much balance between studies and going out and stuff , u'll be fine . Academically pes is harder then other colleges i have friends who study in bms and rv , in bms they basically hint the questions that will come in the exams and stuff like that .  In pes u need to be thorough with the syllabus becoz you will be able to score if you actually understood the subject . So in a way u will gain a lot more knowledge here and if u keep a tab on the events happening around u will be able to learn and upskill urself by taking part in hackathons and workshops. I suggest you to try finishing the studying part in clg itself then u can rest or go out after u leave and dw u can chill during the weekends . and about the fests we do have one big fest every year , usually happens in the even semester and trust me it's really huge and good . And throughout the year there will be one or two events too that we won't be knowig beforehand like any of the clubs might arrange them randomly ."
