So got skeptical if I missed it\n    └── Hey will i be able to register through jee mains do u know something abt it?\n        └── I have no idea rn, I registered quite a long ago (a month maybe), I heard the registration is over but some ppl saying the portal is still open, check on the main website in admissions page",
