    "The difference between PRN and SRN is PRN will be regarding the whole college but SRN will be regarding the course like CSE SRN is for each department",
    "Don't worry information will be updated very soon and you won't be able to get your SRN until each and every CET member gets registered once everyone gets registered then only they will give your SRN\n└── Thanks ✨️🍉"
