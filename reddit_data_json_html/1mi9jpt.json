    "Am from ec campus 3rd sem, and its the same in my section too\n\nFrom what i remember, in last sem my section had a similar situation, but we were able to negotiate shifting of one or two periods into the free period slots and it was fine then\n\nSoo thats one way, you need to know which period to shift, then talk to the related faculty to ensure they are available at the free period timings, then get a few people to sign like a letter or something and submit (idk to who, maybe chairperson?)\n\nAnd then they will decide if the timetable will be changed.",
