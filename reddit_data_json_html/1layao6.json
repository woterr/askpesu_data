    "Faculty is shit for cns,  but okay manageable ac will be easy , cns kinda diff",
    "Ac isas are easy to score as lot of ppl got above 35 ,but cns isas are harder to score (majority of ppl in cnsgot below 20s to 30s, for isa 2 last time highest wos like 33 for cns),but at the end the isas weightage for both subjects is like 20(isa1+isa2 added and scaled down to 20), (ctfs,labs everything come up to 40,that's how it was for us last time),so even if u mess up ur isas(20s and below),the 40 marks would compensate for it, and ur internals would be good(as long as u do labs and ctfs properly)\n└── Just to add on from syllabus perspective,ac slides are small and easy(each unit could be finished in like 2hrs if u understand the concept and how to solv a sum),but conpared to other electives ,cns syllabus is quite big(I think there were like more than 300 pages  per unit) .Cns syllabus was interesting (labs are easy cuz they plagiarized the lab manuals directly from seedlabs ,but they are informative and interesting  if you like networks and security).Faculty is shit for both subs (in ecc)"
