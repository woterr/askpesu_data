  "title": "[Discussion] Downfall of PES Innovation Lab",
  "content": "Back in the day, the PES Innovation Lab used to *actually* stand for something — a place where passionate 1st year students could explore, build, learn and grow. It was about curiosity, initiative, and potential. The whole idea was mentorship and experimentation, not gatekeeping.\n\nNow? It’s turned into a political circus. What used to be about *nurturing talent* is now buried under layers of favoritism, inside circles, and some twisted prestige complex. The bar to get in is absurdly high — and not in a “challenging but fair” way. The entrance tests feel like they’re designed to keep people *out* rather than bring people *in*.\n\nAlso, somewhere along the way, they silently shifted it into a 2nd-year-and-above-only thing. Like… why? The first year is *literally* when people have the most fire, most free time, and most openness to try new things. But nope, apparently if you're in 1st year, you’re not \"worthy\" anymore.\n\nThe lab used to be a community. Now it’s an elite club with a bouncer at the door and no signboard. Congrats, you took something that could’ve built the next wave of innovators and turned it into a resume booster with a superiority complex.\n\nWeird flex, Innovation Lab. Real disappointing.",

    "I was wondering, what was the prompt that was used?",
    "i cant comment much on the gatekeeping. But the aptitude tests are standard interview test questions , one or two questions might be a bit weird but thats it, otherwise all the questions are standard aptitute OA level.\n└── do you solve 40 interview qs in 40 mins with a 30s timer for each q and if u pass the time limit the q is gone? interview qs have negative marking?\n\nIm so glad the innovation lab is j a thing in PES and has 0 value outside of this college\n    └── apart from negative marking , some companies have everything what you said. they have this + a coding section , where you need to pass certain test cases.\n\nyou need to understand that pil has a very low acceptance rate hence  there are these limits.  \nIts same in the industry 100 or 200 ppl sit for 5 roles/positions.  \n  \npil is not \"j a thing in pes\" , they bring in ppl from industry who have even done Phd's, conduct workshops and talks featuring ppl working in Tech. They have a slight edge on opportunities. i heard akamai had come for pil members last year(not 100% sure).  \nMore over the experience you get there is arguable better than any pes research center.\n        └── Agreed that PIL &gt;&gt;&gt; Anything research in pes, thanks for the insight!",
    "This sounds like someone who hasn't been part of lab lmao. Out of several useless clubs in PES, most of 'em stuffed to the brim with useless politics and irrelavent roles, lab has been one of the few spaces where you can actually do somethign relavent. The exam this year was, in some ways, harder than the other years, but of course cutoffs would have been appropriately remedied. In fact, I would like to dissect your answer in points:\n\n1. So you seem to imply that lab is only for 1st years? Actually, anyone from any year can get in, it's just that people from 3rd  year tend to favour company internships over PES ones. Most other years have their summer breaks before first year (I think covid messed up the schedule, I dunno), so of course the lab cannot consider the first years in mind to potentially derail the entirety of the other years at PES.  It still is about curiosity and potential, it actually gets no support from the management, which means that the motivation is entirely out of dedication to the community, a rarity in any space\n2. An environment like that actually has no political motive . There's no substantial money involved, there's no profs children being favoured, interviews are kept unbiased. In fact, I think a friend of mine was told that he'd be interviewed by people who didn't know him, to keep it fair. And there are actually three ways to get in - There's something called the hunt, which is a ctf style event, the tests can be supplemented by the resume, and haschode, which is a hackathon (cancelled, I think, due to time being tight this year or something of that sort)\n3. I think my previous points explain the 2nd year only thing\n4. We have no money for a bouncer :(\n5. Yes, it is a flex to make it in! It's not easy, which makes all the difference, ofc, and leads to salty comments like this one who take it as a personal attack on themselves if they don't make it. Try again next year! It really is a lovely community\n└── bro ik people who got rejected from PIL but now are interning in T1 companies with stipend in excess of 40-50k per month, what kind of a bar is it that's so high that a pvt college club has that is literally harder than landing industry roles?\n    ├── That's great for them! Not getting in doesn't necessarily mean they're less skilled or less intelligent somehow, and being in a club isn't the be all end all indicator of success at all. Also, I dont think lowering standards is a good solution to an already pretty open process. I suppose no matter what you do there'll always be people feeling attacked by some imaginary problem. People be rlly hating on a student run community when there's smth and all happening in the rlly big ones w tons of funding 😭\n    │   └── Ong tho some clubs have 1L ish funding and do absolutely nothing 🙃\n    └── you'd be surprised how scammers, cheaters, bluffers and conners do well in placements\n        └── if they do whatever you said (unfair means) and get into the job, they might/might not do well on the job and not get fired, you never know\n            └── Then you'd be more surprised how mundane work can be. And how, if you want a chill office life, its better to just chill and do things slow than do everything ASAP (unless its critical). Ofc, particulars will vary across teams and offices, but the general view  in most places, both Indian and MNCs, is this. Even research work can be chill similarly as i saw at IISc. Startups are the complete exceptions\n                └── hmm makes sense, so you're saying people without SO much intellect can still cheat their ways to companies and earn a modest living?\n                    └── &gt; people without SO much intellect\n\nthere's more to people than just intellect. integrity, work ethic, etc also matters. \n\n&gt;  can still cheat their ways to companies \n\nif the lesson you learnt from this is that you should cheat to win, you're completely delusional. many more grifters dont succeed. and even if they do, its not a guarantee they'll improve their positions or salaries at their company as someone who knows their shit. they might perform just average enough to stay on-board fir a few years, and then they'll be let go of in mass firings during economic hardships. just cause you didnt make it into PIL, doesnt mean your bad. they are just looking for a different kind of a person, and furthermore shows that they are many many more people that will be better than you. \n\n&gt; earn a modest living?\n\ntier 1 jobs are far from modest. if you want modest, go look up the stats to see how many people or families collectively make over 12LPA\n                        └── noted.\njust a question from a junior to a senior, my apartment friend took pes mechanical as mgmt quota, as i see you're a graduate, how's life? like placement wise + academic wise (when u were in pes)\n                            └── i just finished 8th sem, im not that old. got a tier 1 core job in a good field, so everything's good",
