  "title": "[Placements] Question about FTE + Internship  Roles",
  "content": "Hi, I wanted to know if you're allowed to turn down the FTE part of a role when the job description is FTE + Internship? I've heard that some companies offer you FTE roles based on your internship performance, and some of them sign you on full-time from the get-go. How do you know which is which, and what do you do when you're interested in the internship, but you're not sure if you want to work there full-time? ",

    "No company will hire you full time until you complete your graduation( after 8th sem results you are kinda graduated), so you will be an intern till then, you can choose to go with full time after you complete your internship in most of the cases, you can decline too (but donâ€™t inform the company while joining for your internship)\nâ””â”€â”€ I see. Thank you for the response!Â "
