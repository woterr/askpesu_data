    "Not in India right? Check the nirf ranking. Doesn't matter if they're autonomous they just don't have the facilities and environment like most IITs and NITs do.\n├── nirf has very weird rankings. vit and amrita are one of the top colleges according to them. better than many NITs and BITS\n│   └── They rank universities based on the achievements and number of research papers published by the universities.\n│       └── it's not just that, it's based on a lot of criteria. but the outcome of the ranking is clearly not good though\n└── Oh okay",
    "Tier 2",
    "Near the trailing end of tier 2\n└── whats a top tier 2 or near tier 1\n    └── Ig.Jadavpur( before comming to abuse me go and see State quota, infrastructure and placement , ha fees low hai but kya ukhad le usse) , new iits , lower and north eastern nits\n        ├── ight\n        └── North eastern nits se cse/ece acchi hoti hai?",
    "Tier 3\n├── Tier 2 easily man , if u think pesu is bad take a look at like actual tier 3 colleges ,shit placements, shit infra, shit faculty compared to that pesu is much better...and has some reputation in Karnataka atleast\n│   └── 🙏\n├── Why is that so? Isn't pes u in top colleges in bangalore?\n│   ├── All private colleges in India are tier 3/4 except BITS\n│   └── Lots of suicides tho more than normal\n└── I don't understand why there's downvotes for this. When I've applied for jobs in India as well as Masters programs abroad, PES has always been considered  as Tier 3.\nOnly within Bangalore it may be considered any higher.\n    └── They just left this 🧠 in their washroom."
