    "It has the same weightage as ISA 2, depending on the subject, about 10-20% of your final score I think.",
    "ISA is just like jee mains attempt 1, if you have given your best performance, it will benefit you. In the 2nd ISA, your batchmates usually pick up and the average score goes up. \n\nBut the real test is ESA, you need to do really well to get good grade, if your isa marks are above 25-30 then you are safe, or else make sure your next isa you have this score range."
