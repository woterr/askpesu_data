    "Webtech if you are interested in mern\nâ””â”€â”€ what about DDCO?\n    â””â”€â”€ Not much important for placements, but if you are preparing for gate then very important\n        â””â”€â”€ Depends on the role. A pure SWE role might not really need it but if you are in a role closer to the system then yes\n            â””â”€â”€ okay so for a pure sde we dive deep into dsa and webtech?\n                â””â”€â”€ DSA, projects, whatever interests you. I had 0 webtech on my resume when I applied."
