    "I am a first-year student and based on what I've heard from others, these are the common issues:\n * Poor food quality: The food is reportedly bad, with one example being an excessive amount of sugar served on the second day.\n * Unreliable internet: The internet connection is said to be very weak.\n * Crowded washrooms: The shared washrooms often have long queues.\n * Strict curfew: The curfew is a huge source of frustration.\n * Distance from Campus : The first years stay off campus at amaatra academy approximately 5kms away, which doesn't give you the convience of being close to the campus in contrast to PGs (this would be impactful in situations when you would want to bunk the first class but you wouldnt be able to without an additional expense of an auto since there will not be a recurring bus).\n\nI'd recommend a PG, but hey it's still way better than the hostels you'd find for other colleges in Bengaluru including BMSCE, MSRIT, RVCE..so this might perhaps be an exaggeration as I do not have first-hand experience with respect to this.\n\nTo add to this, A classmate of mine from Uttar Pradesh with 8 years of hostel experience apparently considers this a luxury hence there is mixed opinion, best would be to find it out yourself or take the safer bet and choose a PG.\n└── Thank you so much bro...will consider ur suggestions"
