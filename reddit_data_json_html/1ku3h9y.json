    "nah, just ask for remote, tell that u live too far or something\nâ””â”€â”€ So how do we tell them we want wfh ? Mail them or have to go in person.  \nPs- I live around 25kms from pes it will be really tiring going everyday 9-5\n    â””â”€â”€ In person is best imo, mails is fyn too I believe.   \nI'd try mailing first then if they don't reply for a week or 2 just go in person one day inform them and come back\n        â””â”€â”€ Aight thanks\n            â””â”€â”€ But beleive me the teachers don't answer ur mailsðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­",
