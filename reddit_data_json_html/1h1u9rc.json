    "Don’t bitch anything about another teacher. The teachers are more close among themselves than they’ll ever be with us.\n\nYou can share what you like, what issues you’re facing because of another teacher. But don’t think of them as your problem solvers. Take suggestions from their experience.\n└── Noted",
    "He’s a nice guy, you can be open with him as long as you don’t bash any faculty explicitly. Listen to his advice and draw your own conclusions.\n└── Sounds safe enough",
    "It honestly depends on your teachers how they will judge low attendance. Some may be more particular than others. Usually at least 75% is required. if its less than that then its a problem.",
