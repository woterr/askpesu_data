    "8th sem u have to attend online classes even if u get an internship. Also 7th sem is placements not prep for placements\n└── Depends, if number of credits is excess, then no need to do, but tat most likely wont happen for 2026 batch",
    "complete capstone implementation as early as possible, and focus on placement, dsa plays a major role to get a good paying company.\n\nand try to get into a company where it provides internship+fte so you don't need attend for fte even if you have an only internship offer\n└── DSA ?\nfte ?\n    └── dsa is coding (leetcode,hackerrank),fte is fulltime offer",
    "7th Sem is for the experimentation for CAPSTONE. The classes will be there but the CAPSTONE will be the majority. 8th sem is for internships (special topic only if you don't get a paid internship) and publishing a paper for CAPSTONE.",
