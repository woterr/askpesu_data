  "content": "With such less seats in every branch and negative seats(what do they even mean exactly?) in some, is there any chance of getting a seat in CSE, AIML, or Circuital for a student with a rank 4640? I got mechanical in the first round, and I didn't take it. Thinking logically, I have a very low to no chance imo. They literally asked the candidates with a rank between 4000 to 6000 to not even bring DDS. Should I attend the counseling anyway, hoping for luck?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/90khb10nmndf1.jpg?width=899&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc75bf32d93ad9c0435c58f5c876856bc7d0368a\n\n",
