    "I guess you need to login on some portal with some credentials, that will trigger session on firewall (in this case it's sophos) then you can browse internet.\n\nEDIT: Try to visit http://neverssl.com, then it will redirect you to that particular login portal",
    "You clearly didn't login to the sophos internet portal\nâ”œâ”€â”€ U get net after u give ur pesu credentials in the portal\nâ””â”€â”€ Didn't PESU have some wifi SSID named **eduroam** ?\n    â””â”€â”€ Not sure idk",
    "And btw i dont think GitHub and vs code extensions are banned, u just didnt login to ur portal cause probably u dont have the password till now. U need to sign in to 192.168.254.1 after connecting to wifi\nâ””â”€â”€ &gt;192.168.254.1\n\nWait!! You guys don't have ip address starting with 10.0.0.0/8 ?\n    â””â”€â”€ No, just login to 192.168.254.1 ( type manually in browser) should open the portal and login when u have the password ðŸ”‘",
    "Are you sure you're logged in on the portal? It lets you access pesuacademy even without logging in but you need to be logged in to access anything else.\nâ””â”€â”€ &gt; It lets you access pesuacademy even without logging in\n\nYes, that's the obvious behavior, becoz the web server ( pesuacademy ) is hosted somewhere in the campus, and that's reply back to your browser request.\n\n&gt;but you need to be logged in to access anything else.\n\nYou need to login becoz it will create a session on firewall ( RN firewall is blocking user to go outside the internal network, if the session is created and once user entry is saved then firewall allow him/her to access internet and all the user activities are been logged by firewall ).",
    "???,Github can be accesed once you login to pesu portal with credentials",
    "tailscale and a exit node.....\nâ””â”€â”€ Speed is awful\n    â””â”€â”€ speed ? that will depend on your exit node, because tailscale itself has no speed limit as long as you are not connected over a DERP relay\n        â””â”€â”€ Last time I was able to connect to an exit node, I had an awful connection, like 5Mb/s. I tried it again today and now it just refuses to connect to my exit node.",
    "NMIMS doing the same ðŸ˜­",
    "Just use data lol, plus it seems that u did not login to the portalÂ \nâ””â”€â”€ Login portal in another window ðŸ˜‘",

    "Welcome to PESU\nNO VPN WILL WORK\nEARLIER CLOUD FLARE WARP USED TO WORK, NOW EVEN THAT DOESN'T WORK.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ VPNs work dawg\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Which vpn works ðŸ¤“\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ Openvpn + tcpvpn\nâ”‚           â””â”€â”€ Will give it a try... previously didnt work for me...thnxðŸ”‘\nâ””â”€â”€ That's becoz, initially WARP doesn't works as a VPN, it's just a DNS resolver ( 1.1.1.1 ), but few months back the policies are changed and now it completely acts as a VPN ( internally it uses wireguard)\n    â””â”€â”€ Damn, warp was so good, RIP\n        â”œâ”€â”€ You can even manage to bypass things if you find some loopholes in the network xD\n        â”œâ”€â”€ I know some good shit, but I gotta gatekeep\n        â””â”€â”€ Use TOR , solves everything lol.Â ",
