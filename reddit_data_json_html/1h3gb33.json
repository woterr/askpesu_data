    "I wrote a detailed comment here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/110ajmi/comment/j894etu](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/110ajmi/comment/j894etu)\n\nTLDR: The syllabus expands and tends to get tougher, but it also depends a lot on your interest in the branch: the more interest you show, the easier it gets. Additionally, along with an increase in course difficulty, there is an increase in courseload with more assignments, labs, deliverables, and in general, the effort needed per course to obtain a high grade. Arguably, although the courses in first year are irrelevant, they are the lightest because there aren't many deliverables from assignments and projects, unlike higher semesters where every course has multiple of these. Plus, there is the added extra work from other commitments that creep into your life: exploring and upskilling, finding your interests, looking for internships, placement prep, capstone (depending on which year you are going to) etc etc. So basically, scoring an X GPA in first year takes far lesser effort than scoring X GPA in higher semesters, but its important to note that exceptions do exist. Most people at the end of 8 semesters have a GPA that oscillates between +-0.5 of their first year's GPA with this pattern: balance/slight increase in 2nd year, decrease in 3rd year, increase in final year.\n└── Thanks a lot",
    "Depends on your branch, I've heard branches like ECE, EEE are much harder to maintain your gpa. In CS its relatively easy. 3rd year will be hell though because you will have capstone and a bunch of pretty hard subjects (in CS at least). It's not impossible, but not easy either.\n└── Thanksss",
    "1st year i got the lowest SGPA and every year it kept improving. For example in 3rd year both Sem i got 10. So yeah just enjoy the subject and you can score good marks in 2nd, 3rd and 4th year also\n├── Thankssssss 🙏\n├── This is what I wanted to hear actually 😁\n└── How much did u get in the first year ?",
    "What they mean is that for the same sgpa u need far more effort\n└── Thanksss",
    "(this is specific to CS branch) my CGPA went up every year :D  \nIt does vary person to person and there is indeed more effort needed for later years, but if you're someone interested in CS you'll probably do well compared to 1st year.\n└── Thankssss",
    "It all depends on various factors,\nMight bot be true every time.",
    "it depends on how much you practice and how strict the teachers are while grading. need to know what each teacher wants from students to score. remember assignments matter too."
