    "There is no extra information anyone on this sub can provide beyond what you already know; this is the first time with JEE based scores so *you* guys are our primary source of information on this. Asking here will not help if you yourself don't know the answer. \n\nAlso if you need someone to visit PES, you can try posting on the Discord server. Some kids might be kind enough to help you out by visiting on your behalf."
