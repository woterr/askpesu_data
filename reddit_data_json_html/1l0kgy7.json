    "I would say it's worth it in 4th sem. Just because you have another year for placements, and you'll probably not do too much prep with this lack of a time constraint anyways. So with this \"not too much dsa progress\" in mind, it's not a bad trade off to instead go do some research project with them\n\nBut after 6th sem id say absolutely not.\n└── Aa thank you",
    "Do DSA, study DBMS,CN,OS get 3rd yr summer internship by December.\n└── So you say it's waste of time .\nBtw thanks for the reply\n    └── It's not worth the crucial time you would dedicate towards it, so yeah.\n        └── Oh thanks man🙏"
