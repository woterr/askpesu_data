    "So wait any rank beyond 5k is worthless?\n├── Too early to say that. Seats have increases, and so has the fees. But the number of aspirants as well. Usually cutoffs do increase but no way to say how much.\n│   ├── yes, but counselling is clashing with the JEE ADVANCED dates. And this year to reserve seat you need to be present with the candidate at the ring road campus. \n\nso given the fees constraint + counselling clashing with advanced + need of being present offline + seats increasing + ppl needing to travel during other counselling we might get a chance, right?\n│   │   ├── Counseling is offline every year.

When is the final round usually held?  \nWhat rank did aiml close in e city in the final round previous year??\n└── You can conclude on your own after seeing the cutoffs. \n\nThe final round is usually about a month or so after the first round. It's hard to determine the first round cutoffs since nobody records them, but since the second round usually has at most 5-10 seats, it is usually around the same number",
    "So to confirm our seat we pay the DDs which is **non refundable** right??\n└── The 10k is non-refundable. The amount you get back of the tuition fee depends on when you cancel admission. They charge a certain penalty based on how late you are.",

The remaining refund amount depends on how late you ask for a refund. As long as it is before classes begin, they should return the full fees. If it is after, then they deduct a certain % of your fee for every day of class you attend.\n\nThis is what it usually is, not sure if it has changed this year.

Things have changed over the last few years due to the increase in competition for better colleges. A lot of people appear for counseling.
