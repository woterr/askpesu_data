    "Bro it's shock, at that point of time ur mind goes numb, you cannot do anything even if u want to. Don't beat urself up, it's not your fault.",
    "I'm really sorry you had to witness that. Just know that it wasn't your fault and there was no way you could have known it was going to happen. We cannot change what happened, but we can move forward with what we have. Its a pretty sad and unfortunate event, and I can understand how traumatising it could have been in the moment. I struggled with these exact feelings years ago and I still experience them sometimes. Its not easy, but you will slowly understand that it is not on you. Don't blame yourself. Please take care. \n\nThis goes for everyone in the vicinity of the incident.",
