  "content": "Hello everyone.\n\nI have screwed up my Math ISA very badly due to time constraints. \n\nI would like to know from the seniors if all ISAs are gonna be like this.\n\nWhat will they ask in EPD,chem, Mechanics and Python if anyone can please please tell.  \nAlso how did you manage time? I'm really teary eyed rn and looking for some helpful advice 🙏🙏",

    "To add on, there's no failing in Isa's, is there? And if there is what are the consequences? Also is it relative or absolute grading?\n└── There is no failing in ISA. \n\nISA is always absolute grading. ESA can be relative ONLY if the entire batch does badly.\n    └── Thanks",
    "Hey we had mcqs in math so the average in math use to be pretty high like I know people who did not study and get 19/20\nBut now that's not the case ,you really need to solve to get answers because of hybrid.\nAlso epd and other subject will be easy only if you have done notes/slides. Mechanics could be lengthy same like math.\nAnd\nThere's no failing in isa so chill . Relative will be  only if majority of the batch performs bad.\n└── oh okay thank you sir for the help",
    "Not always but it's not uncommon to have very hard ISAs",
    "Its coz of the new 2 ISA system, even we had time constraint.. so do expect it for other ISA's too.."
