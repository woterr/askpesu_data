    "Why are you comparing between branches? Pick the branch that you're interested in, as simple as that. If you are in two minds because of the campus, then you should know that campus is irrelevant after 3rd year while your branch sticks with you forever.\n└── It has to do with the fact that I'm planning on taking a double degree in either ece or ds either way. I wanted to know if ece will require a more hands on approach hence I'm considering it as my main branch. In terms of pure interest, I prefer cse to anything else.\n    └── Then I'd suggest picking CS as your primary major and ECE as a dual degree, given that your interest is primarily in CS.\n        └── Alright.. thank you",
    "Look up what is done in both the courses. Most btech colleges in India do similar stuff. \n\nPick the one that interests you\n\nIf you are unsure, cse is the way to go. When you're blindly walking into something you might as well blindly walk into the one with better opportunities and better placement stats",
    "Go for cse in ecc, cse offers better placements than ece. It is easier to score in cs which allows you to maintain a good GPA which is important for placements and for higher education.\n\n\nIf you are interested in ece, then you should definitely take it. But if you're just doing it cause of the campus then don't.\n└── But RR campus ECE is horrible and worst",
    "EC Campus CSE",
    "why not RR campus CSE?\n└── Not a good enough rank for that I'm afraid\n    └── okay"
