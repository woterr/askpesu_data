    "no refund is only generated if you got in pes\n├── For example I get aiml in rr campus in pesu kcet counselling i.e on 10 th aug and get pesu ecity ece in kcet round 2 so will they refund my money\n│   └── Same doubt.If I get a branch in PESU KCET counselling and wanna change campus(from RR to ECC) and branch(from say cse to ece) via KCET counselling if I get in in further rounds, is it possible with refund??\n│       └── refund is only granted when you got same branch\n└── no like suppose i get a seat in pes on 10th august and pay the fees and later i get a seat lets say in dsce in round 2, so taht time can i cancel the seat i got in pes and get money back?\n    └── Nope brother that's not the case here",
