  "content": "With the recent changes made on the Wi-Fi connection, now we can't download images and videos on WhatsApp. Why tf would they do it. They choked on torrents and steaming services and now they're after regular downloads .Is there anything we as a collective can do ? In spite of paying 4.1L(hostel additional) why is the service so shitty ?? Never thought I'll regret my college choice over such a na√Øve issue. Really disappointed.",

    "Regretting college choice so quickly into first year eh? Nice\n\nAlso torrents/streaming platforms is nothing. Faced issues where the entire submission portals for some courses were blocked lmao. I was the Teaching Assistant and for a long time couldn't even figure out what the issue was until they told me that they were on hostel WiFi. There was even a short period during which they blocked Quora and Stack Overflow as well cause they came under \"distracting websites\". The WiFi has been a major pain point for hostel kids for a long time now. \n\nAlso as another redditor said, \n\nWelcome to PESU  :)",
    "Now some 3 hrs ago they added restrictions on fcking youtube some videos are restricted all comments are blocked",
    "Welcome to pes.",
    "Isn't VPNs or proxies work?",
    "I was wondering what is the boy's hostel and mess fees for main campus?"
