  "content": "Messed up first year ,  couldn't cross 9 even tho its apparently the easiest year to score in . Need to know what exactly I should do for a 9-9.5+ grade in my 3rd sem. If someone could give a subject-wise analysis or guidance it'd be really helpful.\n\nAlso how much can I increase my final gpa before placements if Im looking at a \\~8.5 after 1st year ( on average how much do people usually end with if they grind the next 3 years properly starting from an 8.5 ).\n\nThanks",

    "Pes academics is almost bs, and there's not too much to \"understand\" or wrap your head around. The hard part is remembering. \n\nIn the 3 years you will almost never in an exam be like \"ahh i can't understand how to do it\", the more common thing is \"ahh i can't remember this formula/procedure /these 5 points for the 5 marks\"\n\nSo there's not much you can do other than spend more time remembering stuff. That's literally the only difference between 9+ and 7+\n\nIf you consistently get Cs and below in everything you should either get your brain checked or spend more than an hour preparing for the exams\nâ””â”€â”€ This",
