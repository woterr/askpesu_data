    "After reading this subject I have to say I'm glad I didn't choose ECE.\n└── Fr bro I would have dropped out💀\n    └── I'm not even bothered studying anymore at this point. They'll give a bad paper in which i anyways know i won't be able to answer anything, so I'm leaving it to God.",
    "Same situation here my guy/girl.\n\n The easiest subject mcse itself was such a shit paper so I don't even want to imagine what ddco and webtech will be like.\n└── It had me in shambles bro, the trauma lasted 2 days so couldn't do ddco as well for that time being\n    └── Yo my mcse was so bad. I messed up the 8 markers and left a 6 marker, left several other questions incomplete too, so don't worry there are people who did much worse than you. As for ddco, I just hope everyone does so bad that they're forced to do relative grading 💀",
    "This subject really makes me question my existence. How does someone go from writing data structure codes in C to writing ASSEMBLY LEVEL CODE and designing counters, registers and random bullshit go.",
    "I have seriously lost my shit, ddco has turned me into a walking zombie   \nalso why does it take like 8 hours to study 1 unit wtf is this bs",
    "Going to eat the snail",
    "We had questions whose logic was similar to those from the textbook,but again until and unless you are interested in ECE stuff its difficult to navigate through the textbook.\nLong story short it was hard and we had normalisation of grades.\n\n\nTbh can't be dependent on normalisation bcz they do it randomly\n\nThis uni is just a black box wrt gardes,ngl.Not much transparency is seen wrt evaluations.\n\nIt's not an ass subject tbh, further on theory subjects like OS are pure pain🌚",
    "Ahh, I remember how bad I used to struggle myself in this subject, reminds me of trauma fr. We were so lucky to have 5 ISA system though.\n└── We are so cooked man, lucky you 😭",
    "Use the textbook. Its something that is suggested every year. They tend to pick problems and questions from the book sometimes, + its arguably the best resource to understand concepts clearly (without which you cannot solve the ESA questions)\n├── I have been using the textbook (my teacher kept repeating it like a parrot) but the subject itself is annoying to study\n│   └── Understandable. Not many are interested in it.\n└── What is the name of the textbook\n    ├── Morris Mano\n    │   └── Alyssa P Hacker still giving me PTSD 2.5 years after I graduated from 🅱️ESU 😭\n    │       └── Ayyo we had that question in isa 😭\n    └── look at the references section on pesuacademy&gt;My courses&gt; DDCO",
    "It's not ass subject, it's just you need more time to master few subjects which you don't have at the moment so pass in that somehow.\n└── &gt;It's not ass subject\n\nNah you are wrong\n    └── Idgaf",
    "Imagine doing the text and pyq for this :)"
