    "Yes. The criteria is your GPA in your first semester. For my batch, it was somewhere above 9. Expect it to be the same or higher.\n├── Okay, thanks a lot\n└── First sem or first year? Also, I have got CSE AIML at EC Campus through PESSAT. CAn you tell if I will have the physics cycle or the chem cycle in sem 1?\n    └── First year. Your cycle is randomly allotted. Half the people get physics and the other half have chemistry\n        └── Someone told me that it is based on your name. Starting from A, half get chem cycle in sem 1, other half gets phy. Is this wrong?",
    "Try your best for it, but it's not like the end of the world if u don't get it, u won't lose out on most of the things at ecc too",
    "CS RR is pretty competitive since there are usually a handful of seats at most and the CGPA cutoff is close to 9.5. You can read more on the FAQs: https://bit.ly/pesu-faq.\n\nAlthough, if you already have CS ECC, why are you trying to shift to RR?\n└── I heard reviews about the EC campus being neglected in comparison to the main RR campus"
