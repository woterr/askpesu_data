    "No suicides in big colleges like PES or RV will come out becoz owners have deep political and media connections.\n\nAditya Prabhu case made some news becoz his mother went to media demanding justice and it gained lot of traction online.\n\nIf not even that case would have been brushed under the carpet\n└── What? Even RV??\n    └── Had one suicide few months back some mech guy.\n\nI know because my brother studies there",
    "bro literally PES has connection with BJP..",
