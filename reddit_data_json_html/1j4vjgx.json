    "Now, I didn't know MRD personally (my father knew Jawahar closely since he was his client), but I just wanted to share a few words.\n\nSince I became an eligible voter, every year my grandfather and I went to the polling booths early in the morning, and amongst our dear neighbours, Doreswamy was also always standing in line. The first time, my grandfather asked me to touch his feet, since my education (and therefore, my future) was in part due to his vision and ideas. He said that MRD's blessings were something I shouldn't miss.\n\nI've voted 4 times in my life, and coincidentally, I've met him and received his blessings every time. I've done well since, and even though I'm not a very religious or \"sanskari\" person, I am very thankful for him. Not just for myself, but also for the fact that he had a major role in the education of tens of thousands (maybe even lakhs) of students in Karnataka and beyond.\n\nMay he rest in peace.\n├── Can students too go and pay respect to him, at his cremation place tomorrow??\n└── That's a really touching story, I'm sure there are many others (me included) who thank him just the same. RIP",

    "The man who made PES for what it is today i truly respect him.",
    "this is true, came in local news",
    "he can rest in peace knowing IIT Banglore will carry on his legacy 🙏🙏",
    "No matter the good and bad things that have happened in the college, but he is responsible for the facilities that we have today. RIP 🙏🏼🙏🏼.\n\nTo all the insensitive scums in the comments, just look at yourself in the mirror once.",
    "My Condolences.",
    "wait what? is this legit?",
    "Why is everyone treating this like a joke? I mean, I know when other colleges gave holidays and PES didn't, ppl said they wouldn't give a holiday even if Doreswamy died, and while that's acceptable, guys, he actually passed away now. Making jokes or  treating it like this, asking about holidays or mrd scholarship and what not, is in such poor taste. A little respect please 🙏",
    "It was way back in 1972 with the intention of reforming the education sector, that PES University was established, and we are now proud to be a part of it.\n\nRespect to you, Sir!",

    "A true visionary who built PES from the ground up. RIP.",
    "Such a strong man, built not just an engineering college but a whole institution. Made education more accessible. PES is easily one of the most reputed colleges in the region. My thoughts are with those close to him.",
