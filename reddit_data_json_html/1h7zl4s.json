    "OP calling it \"atmosphere of PESU\" thinking it's the most important time of the year for PES lmao (their most important time is admission season)\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Ikr ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚\nâ””â”€â”€ Thats y no vibes also ig\n    â””â”€â”€ There won't be any. It's not as grand as you think it is. Most of the time, it's a lot of chaos and mismanagement too.\n        â””â”€â”€ Bruh im hoping we donâ€™t have to wait for hours and hours to finish that ceremony ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚\n            â””â”€â”€ That is exactly what will happen. Search this subreddit or discord, you'll find stories from last year and before about delays",
