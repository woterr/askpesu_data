    "Update: spoke to the cleaning staff of my department, and the security as well went to all the blocks and places I've visited in the last three days and haven't found anything yet and NOBODY knows where the lost and found box is anymore.\nâ””â”€â”€ My birthday is coming very soon, I'd like any help I can get to find this wallet",
    "I had lost mine in the gjb washroom, another friend of mine did too at the same place, same time. Did you happen to leave your bag at those shelves in the washroom? I never found mine.\nâ””â”€â”€ Yes I did ðŸ˜­ thank you for responding. My friend has left her bag there too but hers is still with her so I don't know why only mine got taken\n    â””â”€â”€ Im pretty sure its a student who does it.",
    "Less honorable people would have taken the things inside. Block ur card...or said person can access ur account.\nâ””â”€â”€ Yes will definitely do that, I'm worried because it had quite a bit of cash as well that and it was pretty much all I had for the rest of this month as well as may",
    "If anybody does happen to find it you can send a message on here and I will share my contact details :)"
