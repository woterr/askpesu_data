    "We barely attend college now, unless there is exams or capstone project related work. So there's no point in staying in hostel or pg anymore.\n└── How often do u have to go to rr for interviews ? Is that a factor while choosing the place to stay during 4th year\n    └── Well most companies conduct tests and interviews at RR campus. So it would be ideal to stay at a place from which both campuses are accessible.",
    "Maybe coz they don't have to attend regular classes so pg or flats ig"
