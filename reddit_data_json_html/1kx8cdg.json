    "I might not be suitable to answer this....but if you don't need to spend money in tuitions fees in UK, then, better to go there....more diversified and lil more global recognition....and if you want to settle in us or uk, then definitely abroad....in India then pes....cause doing MSc in UK and doing job in India, won't work out for you....as you willhave someone the other loans...which will be hectic if you be in India....anyways atb to you....this was the answer i got from my dad's colleague daughter....",
    "Msc from uk if you can afford it otherwise MCA \nbtw what questions did they ask you in your interview i have it next week it would be very helpful"
