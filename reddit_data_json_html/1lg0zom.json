    "You guys need to stop posting the same questions again and again. As said before (at least 4x in the last 2 weeks): no, these rules are **not** enforced. Just follow the curfew timings loosely and it's all good.\n\nAny more posts on \"omg these rules are insane do they need to be followed???\" will be straight up deleted.",
    "yes warden checks if u have nsfw things on ur phone every night and also u have to drink a glass of milk (mandatory ) before you sleep /s\n└── facts",
    "None of them is followed, just be inside the hostel before 10pm and no one will ask you, and no u dont need any permission to use electronic devices lol!!!"
