    "If I filled up the form but don't sit for the counseling then my present seat won't be affected right?\n└── No",
    "What? Why is Ecity campus having more demand than ring road? Isn’t ring road the main campus?\n├── I think since RR people had higher jee cutoffs so students either got into josaa , nit, iiits ,got good ranks in kcet/comedk/manipal/bitsat exams and hemce dropped from the pesu jee admission\n└── PESU has no main campus. Both campuses are the same and during placements both campus students sit together"
