  "content": "For the guys who are using the library, kindly maintain the library's decorum. The library is not a place for loud talking/having fun. It is not a place to make phone calls. If you need to take a phone, talk softly and do not talk very loudly which disturbs others. If you want to talk in the library, you might as well use the Brain storming rooms available in each floor.   \n\n\nIf you want to have fun, there's enough space around the campus for that. Hope this message is understood.  \n\n\n",

    "Agreed  \nHowever mostly your advice will fall on deaf ears.  \nI tried telling a couple of people to lower their voice when they were loudly cracking jokes n stuff and they told me to sit elsewhere lmao\nâ””â”€â”€ Thatâ€™s exactly my situation daily too. It is minimum sense that a library is meant to be quiet and it shouldnâ€™t be like a park.\n\nAssume they didnâ€™t know that a library is meant to be quiet. Thatâ€™s fine. But despite asking them to calm down and talk softly, they donâ€™t care .\n\nBoss, atleast after someone requests you to talk softer, listen to them. Weâ€™re all grown ups. Letâ€™s not behave like 10 year old kids who canâ€™t understand if someone says it once",

    "Don't even get me started on the silent reflections room\nWith the whole point of it being SILENT going over people's heads\nâ””â”€â”€ Comparitively, silent reflections is much better\n\nIn silent reflections, the security comes in once in a while and asks people to shut up. But in GJBC, there's no one to do that.\n\nBut why should someone come and ask you to be quiet? It is common sense that a library is meant to be silent\n    â””â”€â”€ Recently that is but still people lack civics sense frfr",
    "Isn't this common sense?\nâ””â”€â”€ As the saying goesâ€¦ common sense is not common"
