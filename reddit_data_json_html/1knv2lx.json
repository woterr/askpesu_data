My overall goal is to go abroad for my master's. Would you recommend PES University? The total fees would be around ₹56 lakh for four years. I don't really have any other options. I am not really sure how much your undergrad college would matter when applying for masters. ",

    "Go to a college where you can easily get a good cg pes is definitely not recommended for a good cg\n└── Check out affiliated colleges, their exams are easier than ours.",
    "if you are okay with paying the management money, check BMS or other VTU colleges if CGPA is your main point. It is easier to maintain a higher cgpa in VTU affiliated colleges. \n\nPES is an okayish college(would not recommend it for 56 lakhs for sure) but it takes a good amount of effort to maintain a decent/good cgpa(8.5+)\n└── Is academics in pes easier than in rvce ?\n    └── Rvce is vtu affiliated too\nVru colleges have easier papers and more lenient correction",
    "Try for BMSCE, easier to maintain gpa when compared to both PES and MoneyPal. The fee structure in the management quota is similar to PES."
