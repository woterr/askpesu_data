    "I am currently in New Block and this is my 2nd year in the same block and I would say it’s better than other blocks, New Block rooms is of three sharing and attached bathroom with study table and wardrobes for 3 people and the bathroom is decent, the best one is MM block( available only after 3rd year) where you have 2 sharing and the bathroom is too good, check room for yourself before the permanent allotment and then select which ever is the best for you during the permanent room allotment process.\n├── Ohh thank u bro 😁\n└── How is the wifi over there ?\n    └── sorry i’m replying late but you can only login through your laptop and then use the hotspot feature of windows 11 and connect your mobile with it, wifi speed is decent but not as good as gjbc wifi speed, but it’s decent for viewing yt, ig reels and stuff.\n        └── Ohh thank uu"
