    "You have one shuffling based on alphabetic order at the beginning of your second year. After that it remains the same. This is how it is on EC Campus CS. It might be different depending on your department. But in engineering in general, you will have a shuffling when you enter your second year since that's when you enter your respective department from the SnH department",
    "In the first year you'll get shuffled based on your cycle (like physics cycle one class, chem cycle another class and vice versa). From the second year onwards you'll be shuffled again into your respective classes based on the department which will continue till you pass.",
    "No",
    "First year is common so some of your classmates may not be yours. From second year its fixed."
