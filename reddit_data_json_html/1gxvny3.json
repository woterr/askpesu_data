    "Score 35-40 next isa \nAnd study very hard for esa \nlol this ans is very generic 😭\n└── Scoring 35 to 40 in all sub..is scoring this in all sub practically possible😭😭\n    ├── Only if you start preparing thoroughly and in advance\n    │   └── What's thorough acc to u..what approach do I need to use?\n    │       └── That's something you'll need to introspect and figure out. You know how you've performed in each course. Sit down and spend some time thinking about why you lost marks or couldn't answer the questions. Was it because (1) questions were tough or (2) you didn't understand the concept or (3) you forgot in the exam or other reasons. Then break down how you can improve on this by either studying more, covering more resources, etc etc. \n\nTo summarise, you'll need to figure out what works for *you*, since what worked for others might not necessarily work for you based on your study habits. For some, it might just be spending more time studying. For others, it might be due to knowledge gaps and not understanding the concept. Figure out what went wrong so you can improve in ISA2.\n    │           └── Yee thankyouu for ur input\n    └── It is \nGrind 2 weeks before isa 2",
