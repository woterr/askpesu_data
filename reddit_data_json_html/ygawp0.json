It takes like 2.5 hrs to travel back in the evenings, and this leaves me with minimal time to study.\nSo I was wondering if any seniors travelling to and fro daily know any way to make my life easier 🙏",

    "Local Hostelite here, my house is 3 hours away from EC Campus. I had taken hostel for 1st year and ngl, i had more than enough time for studies, plus there is alot of fun as well.\n1st hostel in Amaatra academy and the rooms are really good.\nI used to go home on most weekends.\n└── that's great! but my parents dont wanna send me to hostel LMAO, tried convincing them also 🥲\n    └── Then the only thing you can try, is(unless you shift to another college apart from PES), is to try and score really good CGPA for your 1st year, i.e above 9.5+ to get CSE in RR through another round of counselling based on GPA in 2nd year. Itll be a long wait tbh.\n        └── How many chances do we get to shift? Is it only after the first year?\n            └── I've heard it's only at the end of year 1...cuz everyone studies together till then, then we all shift to our own dept...so it doesn't make much sense to shift later\n                └── oh okay.. 🥲",

    "I mean...I'm in RR, but cheers to meet someone else from here lol\n└── I've heard RR is super crowded 😂 how's it going?\n    └── It's actually not THAT bad lmao, lotta people just go from home to class right back home, so it's pretty decent if you wanna just hang around in campus\n        └── nicee.. how's the food there?\n            └── it's good, it's good...having like 7 canteens helps lmao",

    "What rank are you having in PESSAT?\n└── I got around 2100\n    └── So you don't have any other option than just being a day scholar?\n        └── yup... I fucked up cet and comedk too so literally no other options 😂\n            └── I am pretty much in the same situation as you.I got 177X rank in pessat and got PESU EC CSE in pessat r1. Right now I am really confused..Whether or not I should go with the CSE(AIML) course🥲 in pessat r2.\n                └── I'm sure AIML will have great job opportunities in the future.. maybe even more than CSE, but we can never know :')\n                    └── It's not pure AIML tho. It CSE with specialisation in AIML(fixed electives in 3rd yr). All other CSE peeps will be having a specialisation on their degree by the time they graduate. The thing is it's pretty maths heavy and Idk if I'll be liking it or not🥲🥲\n                        ├── ohhh okay.. maybe you could check out some course material and decide.\n                        │   └── Only 6 days left for counselling lmao. It's not like I will understand anything if I go through 3rd year AIML stuff.. The thing I know about it is it's about calculus, statistics,etc.\n                        │       └── yeahh true.. well all the best :)\n                        └── From where did you get to know  it's not pure ai/ml ?\n                            └── From u/Medium-Ad1870 . His dad enquired about the AIML course and COO in the pessat counselling told that it's just CSE with fixed specialisation.\nAlso one of the guy who took AIML told that his course on pesuacademy is listed as CSE(AIML).\n                                ├── I'm also in the same dilemma. Imo if it's not pure ai/ml then it's not as big a risk taking it up\n                                └── yos"
