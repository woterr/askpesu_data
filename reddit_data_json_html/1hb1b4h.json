    "by far the worst paper till now in PESU ... bitches had so many topics to ask from HMM , ANN , Naive Bayes , RNN dimensions etc but guess what they asked from fuckin gradient descent,EM and GMM(which was told to us its self learning and isnt even coming (It wasnt there in some profs. ML drive too .))  \nGone ML grade I hope its relative\nâ””â”€â”€ Wait that's weird, they said a self-learning component *wouldn't* be there in the exam? For us (at least back then), a self-learning component was always considered part of the syllabus, so there was always a chance of it appearing in the exam.\n    â”œâ”€â”€ https://preview.redd.it/50j8tq2ts46e1.png?width=2002&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d32978369c2112c0bb15e8f15aceadd0ad3c5ae\n\nThat ALL THE BEST was a warning :skull\n    â””â”€â”€ we got a mail from the anchor that said no self learning topics would be asked and 10% of the marks would be from lab, neither of which they ended up following and threw us all off track.\n        â””â”€â”€ Ah okay that sucks. PES can throw a curveball sometimes, or most of the time. \n\nAlso weirdly your usernames are related lmao\n            â””â”€â”€ https://preview.redd.it/6gvmgwap026e1.jpeg?width=259&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2f3a609632b9bfc79a5277980cfbb90ce2ca348",
