    "Second round is usually a month after first round. And no, usually there are at most a handful of seats left in each branch in second round. If you do not get a branch in first round, 95% chance you will not get anything in second round.\n└── as the data last yr around 1.6 k was for cse core in rr campus via pessat(35%)...this yr 45% is jee mains, i got 1.5k rank,,, could i possibly get cse aiml in rr??\n    └── Nobody can predict. Attend counseling and find out",
