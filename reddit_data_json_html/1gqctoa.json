  "content": "Okay, so I've seen like a million posts about ISAs from my '28 batch peers already, and I'm disappointed, to say the least. We've been asking questions on literally every single aspect of ISAs, and the answer has always been, \"STUDY.\" It's a simple yet effective answer. I did ask one of our seniors, who is in the 3rd semester right now, with a GPA of 8.13 after the first semester (Physics cycle) and 9.17 after the second semester (Chemistry cycle).\n\nAnd all he said was that he messed up his first ISA, then improved his study plans and methods, and increased his scores in ISA-2 by a margin of 6-8 marks in each subject. He's doing pretty well, I'd say, and he's on his way to another 9 this semester. His only advice was: don't freak out, study at your own pace, don't try to catch up with anyone, and don’t overwork yourself. He said the first-ever ISA is a way of testing the waters, to understand the level and type of questions that are asked.\n\nSo, I feel like – and this is just my opinion – we should just study and not expect too much from this ISA. We've got a lot more ISAs and ESAs ahead of us.\n\n",

    "He Pretty much sums it all up really well, the probability of fucking up your first ever isa is pretty high and it’s really not the end of the world even if you do. Just Don’t compare yourself with the peeps who get above 30 in all subjects, and keep a cool head ,study consistently and your set",
    "I’m in my third year, and just the sight of the test center building gives me major ptsd. The sleepless nights, the all-nighters before every single exam it’s horrible. My brain feels completely fcuked. Honestly, just typing this out feels depressing. But yeah, just one more year, and I’m out of this jail."
