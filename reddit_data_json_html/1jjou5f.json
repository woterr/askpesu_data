  "content": "Every day i wake up at 6 or 7 am and try to reach college by 8:45am, every day its a struggle to get out of bed\n\nevery day i worry about if traffic will make me miss the first hour, and every day i spend vast sums of money just tryna GET TO COLLEGE\n\nevery day i sit in class and try to figure out a way to pass the hours,\n\ni sit there and waste my youth away, minute by minute\n\nIts not that I don't like studying, its just that the topics they cover are always either: shit i already know OR shit that i couldn't even hope to comprehend\n\nand guess what? i HAVE TO BE THERE, the 75% attendance requirement means i cant just sit in the library and study the syllabus at my own pace, i HAVE TO be in the room and pretend to listen to my professor yapping about sum shi\n\ndont get me wrong, i dont blame my professors, its genuinely difficult to make 90 minute session engaging for everyone, and everybody inevitably learns at their own pace and it's impossible for a single person to cater to all 60 students at the same time\n\nand just when i thought that the week was getting repetitive, i look at the calendar, and its a FUCKING TUESDAY\n\nLITERALLY MOST OF THE WEEK IS STILL LEFT\n\nAND I EVEN HAVE A LAB SESSION LEFT+TOMORROW I HAVE SCRIPT REVIEW SO I CANT EVEN DIP EARLY\n\n3 more days until the weekend, 10 more weeks for the semester, and 2 more years until i get my degree, idk if ill make it to the end intact\n\ni need a hug but all my friends are so busy actually being productive and accomplishing something in life (im so proud of them) and im sitting here, doing absolutely nothing\n\nit feels like i just wake up every day to pay half of my life savings to some auto driver so he can take me to a giant piece of sandpaper that i can rub my face against for 6 hours\n\nevery. single. day.",
