  "content": "Hello, I am currently a 12th-grade student and have recently received an offer letter from PES for the BBA LLB program. I am seeking verification to access the Discord server, as I believe it would be immensely helpful to gain valuable insights about the program, the university, and the overall college experience. Additionally, I would like to connect with current college students to better understand what steps I should take next in preparation for this important phase of my academic journey. Your assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated.",
