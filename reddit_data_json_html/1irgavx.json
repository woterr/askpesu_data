    "sitting near the front, keeping your eyes partially open while your head is slightly lowered, using your hand to shield your face from the teacher's view, maintaining good posture, and avoiding obvious signs of sleep like snoring or head nodding\n├── OMG this is exactly how i survived 6 sems at pes😭😭😭\n├── Dil kinbaat boldi bhai ne\n├── May I ask u sir where u got ur phd in this subject?\n│   └── PES University Parappana Agrahara Campus\n└── Enidu media.. what is this ?

    "Assert dominance. \n\nMake it such that you either sleep, or you talk with someone else. \n\nHe'll be happy you're asleep",
    "Once I was sleeping in the last bench and the professor woke me up moved me to first bench and cut attendance and I was really mad because she knew my name and could have cut attendance without waking me up",
    "Just sit behind tall ppl and sleep.Tested successfully for 3years\n└── this is one of the rare times I actually dislike being taller than most people",
    "Long hair is such a W in situations like this",
    "I actually happen to be an expert on this (according to my friends atleast) \n\n1) start rubbing your eyes, touching your forehead like you have a headache etc. the teacher will probably think you are unwell so they will be chill if you sleep \n2) choose the right time, if the teacher is repeating a topic or revising you can sleep. Alternatively choose the days carefully do not consecutively sleep in every one of their classes. Interact when you are awake and sleep peacefully.\n3) as many have mentioned you can either sleep on your hand while \"looking down at your book\"\n4) try sleeping for 10-15 min intervals not more than that, most teachers are chill with it (although I've managed to sleep for 30 minutes don't risk it lol)\n5) if you are sitting in the middle rows it is easier to sleep \n6) most teachers are chill with you sleeping but don't make it a habit. If your teachers don't allow it do not risk it cause some have even attempted to cut internal marks. \n\nHope this helps lol :)",

    "Sit somewhere in the middle rows of any column in bench , I feel it's the best place to sleep as teachers usually observer the last bench and first benches . Also tilt your face downwards and half close your eyes .",
    "comment karma kaise lete hai mujhe bas 3 chahiye taaki ek question puch saku",
    "Just sleep most of the teachers don't care",
    "Sit in the front row, just beneath faculty's nose.\nAs per my experience, in my college teachers mostly focus on students sitting in the mid. So I either sit in the front bench or at the very last from where I can hide behind guy/gal's back sitting in front of me.",
    "ain’t that deep just put a nap bro, more the people the merrier. been mastering this since sem 1. never got into trouble a single time, just make sure to have a solid meal before and prepare for your nap before itself",
    "Sleep outside the class 👌🏼.\n\nJokes apart practice the art of sleeping without keeping your head down. Use your hand for support under your chin.",
    "Always pick the blind spots like middle benches or 2nd and 3rd bench of the side rows. Most faculties skip that part of the class and u can sleep through out the lecture",
    "Just got caught today for sleeping 😭",
    "Sleep with ur eyes open 😂",
    "....",
    "Just go to the last 2nd or 3rd bench either in first or in last row and keep a friend as a guard and sleep.\nYou won't get caught 😜",

    "Ask the male CR of ECE \"E\" section",
    "It depends on the teacher and where you're sitting."
