    "Why haven't you visited the COE yet? This is not something that will resolve on its own. You do realise that they've caught you for malpractice right? There are consequences which you need to deal with, you can't just forget about it or pretend it never happened. PES is pretty strict with these thinga and unfortunately will go to any extent to penalise you for it.\n\nVisit the COE and plan out your next steps from there. Understand what you did was wrong and you're responsible for it. You're an adult now, take accountability for your actions.",
    "Your results ain't coming until you go to CoE's office  \nThey'll update it within the same day you actually visit instead of pretending like it never happened",
    "Or rather meet the CoE along with your parents. You know you can't get away with that. They'll just  hold your results.",
    "keep us updated on whats happening tho I'm here for the drama (no offence good luck)",
    "Was it after you submitted your paper that you got hold of your phone? If it was a serious case of malpractice you'd probably need to take that subject as a backlog."
