    "Eh, claim makes sense. Last year's, placement stats do support this.\n\nAs a current fourth year, I get a mail almost every other day from pesu placements, with mostly tier one companies.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Also most of my friends with less than 8.5 cgpa got placed with more than 12 lpa jobs\nâ”œâ”€â”€ W pesu.. \n\nThis was actually an appreciation post.. The title looks like it's some defamation post or something xd\nâ””â”€â”€ How's the placement policy there ? If we get a job above 15lpa will they allow to sit for better opportunities?\n    â””â”€â”€ No, if u get a tier 1 job, then that's it, you're out of placements..\n        â””â”€â”€ *Except for dream companies\n            â””â”€â”€ Ohh dream tier is altogether a different tier? I thought it comes under tier 1 itself..\n                â””â”€â”€ It's above T1",

    "Umm not completely true lmao.. I remember seeing last year's placements stats in orientation last month, in that the category with &gt;8.75gpa had some 70 odd unplaced studentsðŸ’€\nâ””â”€â”€ Idk if it's true or not, but i remember him saying that almost 25 percent of the students go for higher studies right after their bachelor's.. And pes doesn't even maintain the data of registered students to placed  students ratio.., pes only shows the total number of eligible students and placed students count, so ig many students having more than 8.75 cgpa would go for higher studies..\n    â””â”€â”€ Yeah that's true. I think in my mind I assumed those guys went unplaced at that timeðŸ’€"
