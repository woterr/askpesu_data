    "first 2 to 3 months in 7th semester , most of the top companies come with internship + FTE offers where you  do  the internship in 8th sem and FTE later. 8th sem onwards lesser internship +FTE offers and just FTE  or just internship offers will be coming. some exceptions are ofc there.  \nBut you still have 1 month approx to build your resume. so all the best. make sure to add your sem projects and deploy them if you can.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ deploy means?\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ make your project live on internet.If you deploy you will get a link for that project and you can put it on your resume or any where else you want to show it.\nâ””â”€â”€ Also what if I get only an internship offer? Then how can I get an FTE?\n    â””â”€â”€ other companies come only for FTE , you are still eligible for them.",
    "Most tier 1 companies do come in 7th sem, few (but not zero) in 8th sem. You still have time to build up your resume now. If there is a time-turner, that's the only way you'll go back in time",
    "You need to keep an eye out for the placement details."
