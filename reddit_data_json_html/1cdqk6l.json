    "I applied too, they said they'll mail a link and you need to upload your mains marks card on it when they send it. they haven't sent it yet but watch your mail.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Can i get cs with 96 percentile?\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ I asked my pes friend \nHe said i might get in\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ I am giving pessat too\nâ”‚           â””â”€â”€ Cutoff is very high there all the best\nâ””â”€â”€ They took 1200 right? \nAnd the dashboard is not responding\n    â””â”€â”€ I paid 1200 and it went to a page asking for further details. After filling it we downloaded the application and that was it\n        â””â”€â”€ Yeah the page which had fathers name and all",
    "OP plz tell me did u pay the application fee first and then filled the form or the opposite? And i got 95.81 pr do u think i can get cse in pesu?\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Paid first then filled.\nMake sure you do it under btech through jee mains. \nBro even idk competition has increased severely. High percentile people are also seeking admission in PES ðŸ¥²\nâ””â”€â”€ Apply for all 3 branches\nCSE\nCS (AI/ML)\nECE",
    "Can we apply through both pessat exam and jee scores? Can anyone confirm me\nI have already written pessat exam and i have got 95.14 in jee\nâ””â”€â”€ how many did u attempted and how many guess work in pessat??",
    "You need to get below 10k for that in jee m\nâ””â”€â”€ Wtf man why would someone join pes with that rank. Is there any college left in this fucking country who doesnt want fucking AIR 1\n    â””â”€â”€ They don't want anyone from jee to join them as the fees would diffeent for them\n        â””â”€â”€ Bhai 10k rank ka matlab jaante ho? 99.5%ile + . Chod  bc management le raha mai at max\nI am done with this bs\n            â”œâ”€â”€ Bhai management mei 50 l+ for cse ig ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ i am not sure tho\n            â”‚   â””â”€â”€ What i heard from my friend in pes is admission is based on percentile not rank. And thanks to this overpopulated country i cant get iiit. Just hoping for pes now.\n            â””â”€â”€ You need 98 as far as I remember. Someone commented about this on a post a few days ago.\n                â””â”€â”€ Oh\nAnd what about pessat? Is it required if i go through mains? They haven't asked my mains marks also yet\n                    â””â”€â”€ You don't need to give Mains to give PESSAT, same for the other way round.\n                        â””â”€â”€ I meant if i am seeking admission through mains i dont have to give pessat right?\n                            â””â”€â”€ Nope, as far as I know. Might want to confirm with someone who joined via Mains, but that's rare to find. Best way is to ask PES directly.\n                                â””â”€â”€ I cant find anyone plus office will be closed till monday and then pessat is till next week ðŸ˜­",
    "you applied ok but do you think its worth it? paying 4.8 lakhs per year if you join cs   \nif you are a citizen of karnataka you wrote kcet? what happened to that\nâ””â”€â”€ The ranks this year are trash they have doubled at the same percentile cause the number of candidates increased drastically. So left with no options but private colleges. I reside in Bangalore and ig it's better to get a private college here than in a tier 2 City. I couldn't give kcet because i don't have domicile. Will give comedk\n    â””â”€â”€ Even I am your batch only lol\nIf you revise well enough i believe you have a good chance of getting  rv cse  being a 97.2%iler even after the bs that happened this year \nAnd pesu doesnt take admissions through comedk\nYou applied for bitsat?\nHopefully you did \nTry for that too\n        â””â”€â”€ I did. But to be very honest I am tired of all this bs i just want peace i will settle for less ðŸ˜­",
