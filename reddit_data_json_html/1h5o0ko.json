  "content": "this girl just sits on her ass all day, doesn't go outside for 2 seconds and refuses to give me any privacy. she's always on the phone with her dumbfuck boyfriend. By always I mean ALWAYS. she could at least go outside the room to talk to him but noooooooo she absolutely HAS to talk to him in the room only, and on speaker too, so I can listen to all their cringey conversations. Fuck you and your ugly ass boyfriend. She also throws all of her stuff on my bed when I'm not around and dirties it. I've tried reasoning with her but her pea sized brain doesn't give a shit. Yeah, she apologizes a shit ton, does she mean it? Fuck no. and on top of all that, she is the fakest person ever. You know those subtle mean girl vibes that you would get from the popular girl in school? Yeah, that’s her. Long story short, I cannot stand her.\n\n\nWe literally have esas from this week and I'm trying to study. I usually go to my friends room when I need to study but I can't keep doing that forever. The only thing I need is a quiet, peaceful room but apparently it's too much to ask for.",

    "Yo don't even complain at this point, this girls hostel is filled with such bullshit. This girl in my room has no life at all. Doesn't go out, doesn't have friends, doesn't take baths for days, doesn't change her clothes, sleeps in the same clothes at night that she wore to college. Stinks a lot, does some random fucking skin care and care hair which doesn't even work, and is annoying as fuck. Like disgusting fucking annoying. Never thought I'd do this here but God it's aching to live with a degenerate. Trust me you just gotta wait this out or move.\n├── I swear to God.\n\nSome of these girls need to learn basic fucking hygiene and some decency.
