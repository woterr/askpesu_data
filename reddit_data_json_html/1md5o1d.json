    "&gt;the food tastes soo bland u have to deepthroat 4 cocks at a time for it to go down ur throat (some days)\n\nunreal description\nâ”œâ”€â”€ So true. It's not bad yk. U might feel it as repetitive but it's not that bad. And mind u, these are all not *absolute* requirements but it wud be nice if u had them\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Food absolutely tastes good. But its bland af might as eat plain rice\nâ””â”€â”€ Its true tho ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­",

(A sheet with 15 tablets costs 50-60 Rs)  \nin just 100-120 Rupees per month , Everyday you are going to add Almost every vital vitamin with 80-100% RDA .\n\nTrust me , the hostel food is good but not the most nutritious . At the cost of a single Shawarma , you are getting what you should be getting for 30 days !"
