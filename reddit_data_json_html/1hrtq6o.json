    "Getting verification failed error while signing up :(\n\n\nSeems like some firebase auth issue\n└── Let me dm you\n    └── Hello all, We fixed the issue. It should work for you now! Thank you very much!",
    "Hi guys, thank you very much to everyone who let us know about the auth issue! We could get to this issue in time and we have fixed it. If you already downloaded it, please give it a try now. It will work for you! Thank you again!",
    "is it open source\n└── The app is open for everyone to use! If that's what you meant.\nEdit: It's a private app that serves you! Hope you guys find company to eat with using Solono 😀\n    └── How do u not know what open source means\n        └── Haha, I don't know why the assumption was that I am unaware of what open source is 😀 That was just a nice way of saying of course not. If you follow the link you will be able to find the app 😊\n            └── &gt;I don't know why the assumption was that I am unaware of what open source\n\nBecause you answered X with Y. \n\n&gt;That was just a nice way of saying of course not\n\nYou could have simply said so instead of trying to give an answer completely irrelevant to the question. You should always be direct and clear when your potential users ask a question.\n                └── Fair point! I should have said no. Just for clarification: It's not. It's a private app",
    "slop, ditch it.\n├── We are thinking you haven't given our app a try yet! Please go ahead, try it and give us feedback. We will roll our next updates out with your suggestions implemented :) Thanks in advance!\n└── Hi, we would like to know more and collect feedback so that we can improve. I will DM you!",
    "GUI looks good! Dark theme is huge W\n\nIf you dont enter your phone number when creating an acc it hangs\n\nIt doesn't ask for location perm and just displays that perm hasn't been given on first open. The prompt box only showed up when I clicked on the requests tab. After giving permission I still see \"user denied...\" message on home tab.\n\nFew bugs but excited to see if this works. I was skeptical at first when you guys were posting about the development but It's being made well so I'm hoping it works and lets people socialize easier\n\nIt's 2025 and it has never felt harder to just approach people. You can't just talk to people like you used to be able to.\n└── Thank you so much for the review!!! We will address all these issues one by one. We are aware that the flow is a bit slow. We will work on improving it. Really appreciate the inputs! Very helpful for us to know how you feel!   \nSame here. It's like the population grows with an invisible distance between individuals. So close and yet so far. Really hoping this gives us all some support in the form of community!"
