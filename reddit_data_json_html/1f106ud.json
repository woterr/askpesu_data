    "ISA usually tests you on concept wise MCQs and fill the incomplete code type questions for dsa \nLeetcode easy type questions can be asked too for dsa\n\n\nFor web dev there might be questions where you can be asked to implement code based on given info from the question \n\n\nI would suggest you also go through the esa pyq and solutions once you complete reading concepts bcoz they might pick a direct question from there\n\n\nUltimately studying a fixed number of hours and getting an S grade is subjective and varies from person to person but aim to finish the content from the slides first and then solve lots of problems.\n\n\nGood luck :)\n└── okay thanks alot:))), so where could i possibly practice such questions on webtech, any textbook etc??\n    └── Pyqs can be of some help\nFor mcqs you just need to properly know your concepts\n        └── ok thankss dude"
