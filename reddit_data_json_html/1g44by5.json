    "The selections for first year students are already done. Wait for the next selections ig.\n└── I see. Are the basketball and badminton teams pretty good?\n    └── No idea but from what I've seen only 3-4 first years got selected in many sports out of around 30-40, so i expect the teams to be good.\n        └── Bro pls tell me whatever u know about the basketball team. How often do they practice? How often do they go to tournaments? Etc\n            ├── I'm not in the basketball team so idk about their schedule. Pretty sure they practice almost everyday after college like other teams. Just head towards the basketball court around 4. You might find some in the team, talk to them.\n            │   └── Okay\n            └── my friend is in bb team and they practice quite  bit, often enough that he is already tired of it lol\n                └── Is he a 3rd year? Or 4th?\n                    └── 1st bro, he got selected a week ago or smth\n                        └── Ohh I see\nWhen did u guys join the college tho?\n                            └── exactly a month ago,\n                                └── Ohh I see\nThanks for the info about basketball tho",
    "they play so srsly bro what u talking, it seems the cricket coach is damn nice here, go to mrd u will see badminton sweats over there.  \nTeams do exist but their selections are over.\n└── Ah, good to hear they r serious",
    "lol if your at EC campus even if your Sachin Tendulkar you wont make it to the PES team\n└── I don't play cricket but why is it so? Is the team too good?\n    └── politics they give preference to rr campus students\n        └── Wtf! I thought both campuses had their own teams!"
