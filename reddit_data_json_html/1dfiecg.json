    "wtf is wrong with management are they fucking retarded instead of helping the students they making a fucking bird cage out of the college. fucking retards\nâ””â”€â”€ No other Choice left for them bro the Education would have instructed them to do this As they Were 4 Sucide Cases So the UGC Would have advised them or the police would have advised them to do this\n    â””â”€â”€ Ugc gave advise to make the exams easier and open book tests, they didn't tell to close the entire campus with steel bars,but again who does what the counsil says it's generally just \"advisory\"",
    "Time to make this campus viral all over Bangalore",
    "Omg the students are committing suicide.... Let's lock them in a cage instead of solving the actual issues.",
    "Can I bring my DSLR to the zoo? /s\nâ”œâ”€â”€ rn animals are on break I guess, why don't you wait till August?\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Damn, thanks for the heads up. Will bring my camera and capture the specimen in a few months.\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ Can't wait :))\nâ”‚           â””â”€â”€ On the bright side, you can finally see your friends where they truly belong - the snakes den /s\nâ””â”€â”€ Some of us animals are still struggling with this exhibit called ESA, you can come witness the magic if you wish to\n    â”œâ”€â”€ I seen them when cage was being made, I think they (cage building fellas) had some contract do before ESA results come. They were chilling on their laptop.\n    â””â”€â”€ Will put in leave at work just for this. Which exhibit will I find you in? Bird cage in MRD or the aquatic exhibit near the lake\n        â””â”€â”€ 8.30 - 11.30, Mech block, animal torture exhibit, aka the exam halls. That place is literally a mental torture facility at this point given how bad my ESAs have gone. \nAfter that, the MRD Bird Cage is my preferred choice of... Uhh, cage ? \n\nPS: You've heard of Pick Your Poison. Now get ready for Pick Your Prison. Proudly brought to you by PES EC.",
    "I feel sorry for the juniors now\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Anyways, even if this not happens I am not counting myself for a free heaven ride.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ As an upcoming 1st sem. Student ðŸ˜¢\nâ””â”€â”€ My session starts in august in ec campus, please explain what happened\n    â””â”€â”€ They turned the beautiful block into a bird cage",
    "Post it on r/bangalore. Make sure college gets so embarrassed they remove this.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Makes so much sense tbh, OP should consider the suggestion\nâ””â”€â”€ Bruh",
    "This is not a college, it is jail.\nâ””â”€â”€ pigeon house :(",
    "What's going on here? Explain.\nâ””â”€â”€ Theyre putting up grills because of the recent incidents of students committing suicides\n    â””â”€â”€ is this problem specific to ec? Isn't ec the fun one.\n        â”œâ”€â”€ Sir this is PESU\n        â””â”€â”€ What is fun in PESU?\n            â””â”€â”€ relatively compared to rr, rr seems cramped af.",
    "Thank God I don't have to go to jail anymore",
    "I would like to call it as concentration camp",
    "No shit, y'all keep jumping off",
    "![img](avatar_exp|138199880|fire)\n\nBIRD SANCTUARY",
    "What are they actually doing?",
    "good luck getting new admissions now lmao\nâ”œâ”€â”€ I have gotten admission in the first round of counselling, please explain what happened and why\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ There were 3 suicides in pes ec this year alone, \n\nThis was management's answer to that. \n\nIf u can still get something in the jee or bits counseling take that. \n\nI am sorry but this isn't a place where u should spend ur 4 years. There was already close to 0 campus life, now its a jail. Like what ????\n\nStupid ppl in management.\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ Is the situation the same now, are these grills removed? Got allotted ec campus cse in mock, what should I do?\nâ”‚           â””â”€â”€ Try for RR Campus, BMS CSE, MSRIT CSE  \nDon't think RV CE is even a question rn.\n\nif you don't get any of those clgs then PES EC isn't terrible either, sure the grills would suck but atleast you prolly won't be unemployed with choices like Dyanand sagar etc.\n\nAnyways there was never that much of \"college life\" to begin with and lots of times we just go out of campus to spend time.\n\nMoreover I think decent amount of people will forget about the grills in time but ya its certainly not better than not having grills\n\nEDIT : Just to confirm Grills not removed and didn't hear a single rumor of them planning to remove the Grills\nâ””â”€â”€ PESU's hold on the mainstream media is insane. Good luck to the clueless future juniors :')"
