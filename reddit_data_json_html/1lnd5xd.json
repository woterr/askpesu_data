  "content": "I got around 7k in CET \nI'm interested in taking up ECE. According to previous year cutoff in last round, I might easily get ECE as cutoff is like 12k\nIs there any chance cutoffs increase due to metro connectivity? I dunno but ig cutoffs are bit less due to location factor of it being far.\nWhat do you think?\n\nAsking this coz, I should decide on whether to apply through PESU quota(the one with 5L fees). If I can get through by CET itself, I might not. So I wanted your opinion.",

    "It probably won't change as our batch also expected the metro to be available before our 2nd sem but still haven't even set foot in the station",
    "Its coming this year\n└── we never know, its always been postponing",
    "its okay you will be 80 by the time yellow line becomes functional",
