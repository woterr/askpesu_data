    "Dr Sandesh Jayanth, HOD, EC Campus, was my capstone mentor. He is very busy and will take time to submit LOR. Approach at least 1 month earlier than deadline. Get everything pre-printed, do not wait for them to read it, they wont. Just type the LOR (max 500 words, TNR with 12 font, otherwise wont fit in letterhead), get the letterhead from Sandesh Sir, print it, get it signed, stamped, and scanned, at least 1-1.5 months prior. And very limited number of LORs (I barely got 2 or 3)\n\n  \nAlso letterhead in EC Campus IS A MUST. none of the teachers (mine were Arti Maam and Sandesh Sir) will sign any random paper. I got heavily reprimanded for the same. So please make sure to get letterheads from Sandesh Sir and print it.",
    "Did she outright say that she will not give more LoRs?\n├── I believe theres instances where she has bailed out. I know a person who promised would get 4 but ended up getting only 2. So have backup teachers in that case, and get them all scanned at least before October\n└── Yes , strictly",
