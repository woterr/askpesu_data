  "content": "As an ECE student who is fixated on robotics as their career, do I have ANY like literally any scope in India? I always thought I would be doing my Masterâ€™s abroad, hence didnâ€™t worry about the path I chose. But ever since the conditions have been constantly deteriorating abroad, I want to know if I do have scope in the robotics field right here in India. Seniors who have any experience or can guide me in any way would help me a lot!",
