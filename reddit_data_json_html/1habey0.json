    "Hello there! 🌟 We’re conducting a fun and insightful study on how students like **YOU** manage your finances. From food cravings to weekend getaways, your responses will help us uncover trends and patterns in student spending habits. 🛍️🍕\n\nWe are \"**Mean Boys**\", a Statistics Team from AIML Branch, RV College of Engineering, out on an Adventure to find out how Students Spend their Wallet. This survey will take just **5 minutes** of your time, and your responses will remain **completely anonymous**. Let's explore where the money goes and what it tells us about student life!\n\nThank you for helping us with this exciting project!"
