    "Definitely full stack. Takes a lot more than a Bachelor's degree to get MLE roles.\nâ””â”€â”€ Other than masters does good enough experience help secure those ai/ml roles in the industry?\n    â””â”€â”€ Pure ML/Scientist roles will always need a Master's (sometimes even a PhD). Any other kind of Applied AI/MLE roles might open up after a few years of industry experience, but even those need relevant ML engineering experience."
