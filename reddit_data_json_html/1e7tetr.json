    "1) for subjects if the prof teaches well, your work is sorted, just pay attention\n\nIf you are unable to follow the way a prof is teaching, then use slides/notes of PESU academy /textbook depending on the depth and you can always search for good YouTube videos / NPTEL courses for second year courses atleast \n\n2) clubs are for you more than your resume\n\nLike if u are into music or dance or debate, etc, they let you enjoy college more \n\nI personally never looked at it from a resume perspective \n\nFrom a masters perspective,  if you don't have any extra curricular experience outside of school then its better to go for a club(based on what YOU LIKE and not on what they want) cuz they look at uniqueness and how well-rounded you are \n\n3) if you plan on writing gate, 3rd year is the ideal time to prepare \n\nOtherwise focus on your core subjects properly(gate is mainly based on those only) +minors if you are taking\n\nUpskilling is something you can go for if you find something fascinating but it's not in your course or in your 3/4th year when you need those skills on your resume if you have a specific job in mind\n\nThen again, companies look at how strong your fundamentals are because in their field you are absolute beginners \n\nso make sure you are giving importance to your second year courses as you are aiming for a core job.\n└── Thanks a lot bro for replying"
