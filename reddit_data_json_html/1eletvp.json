    "Based purely on colleges, PES RR would be a better pick in terms of academics and placements ( also infrastructure and campus ) , that is if fees isnt an issue. But kcet fees is really less and you could consider BMS as well. Also scholarships do exist in PES but u will still be playing slightly more than KCET",
    "If money is not matter, PES RR CSE is far better option than BMS\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vksZAOa1wtU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vksZAOa1wtU)\n└── man ew stop recommending his videos\n    └── What is wrong in that video? I can see all the points are absolutely correct",
    "Bmsce is more feasible",
    "Search the subreddit, BMS CS (CET) vs PES CS (PESSAT) has already been discussed. TLDR - pick BMSCE."
