    "Didn't yall already fill preferences online?  \nWell for pessat last year, offline was the only option afaik.\nâ””â”€â”€ we did but the website says that counselling for admission thru mains and kcet is offline only, which is a bit of a hassle. but canâ€™t do anything else i guess.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/izbrl5gwgk2f1.jpeg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66f4301421cd8385bb8664ee22cfbb51fdea1721\n    â””â”€â”€ If they say its offline it is offline.  \nI have a friend who came all the way from Jammu for thisðŸ’€.  \nIg they asked for preferences just to collect data.  \nIt is kinda nice tho ngl.  \natb."
