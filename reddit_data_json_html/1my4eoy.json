    "For me I needed to purchase only 1 book, but if you act fast ull get the books from library\nMost teachers don't force on books, mostly read from slides\n└── Yeah ok thanks 👍",
    "U might need the tb for engineering mechanics statics depending on ur prof. For the rest of the courses slides r more than enough, if u wish u can use the pdfs of the respective tbs too no need to purchase them\n└── Ok thanks 👍",
    "For me only Mechanics statics textbook we needed to buy. I didnt even do that since people started black marketing that book. I just borrowed that book from the library and kept re-issuing it every 2 weeks. Saved like 800-1200 bucks (including student black market prices)\n└── wtf is student black market\n    └── Some guy stocked up like 9ish books and sold atleast 2 in my class at high prices cuz ppl were dumb enough to not check mrp\n        └── Just take it from library lmao or a pdf",
    "I dont even know what books they used for 1st year, or 2nd year. Only for Mechanics : Statics\n\nPS: I have 11 CGPA"
