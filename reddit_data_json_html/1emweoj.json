    "Both work pretty good , rn I use jio and it's pretty good connectivity.",
    "I get Jio 5g here but my friends who have airtel also get good speeds. If you already have airtel don't bother with changing it",
    "If your classroom is in the \\*03 to \\*08 series, Jio is better. If your classroom is in the \\*01 or \\*02, Airtel is better. \n\nEither way, choose the one that works best in your area of residence, especially calls. I've had bad experience with WiFi calls with Jio, so I'd go Airtel. You have pretty good WiFi at EC Campus and you can do almost everything except play an online game (They are DNS Blocked)"
