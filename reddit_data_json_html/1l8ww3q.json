    "Bjd electives will generally be a little harder. And it'll have a big project+ 2 kaggle competitions\n\nThe electives taken by the guy called doreswamy are the easiest. He gives a question bank which is slightly bigger than the paper. And contains the paper. Average isa marks are like 38 or so.",
    "\nChoose AI  for smart manufacturing and supply chain optimisation.\nIf u Gpa is low or u wanna get an easy S grade.\n\nCourses like Social computing and advanced data analytics are a bit time consuming and has more volume. But extremely useful if u are interested in getting papers or good Aiml projects. Again take it only if u r interested."
