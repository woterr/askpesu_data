    "Exactly my doubt bro if they haven’t segregated seats for jee and kcet pes counselling itll be a mad screwup",
    "look total seats reserved for JEE MAINS+KCET is 45% which is 320 seats for CSE out of 720\n\nOut of these 320 maybe its 260 for mains+60 for kcet... and in these 260 for mains there is overbooking of seats which will be adjusted in the 60 kcet seats..\n\n(this is an assumption not confirmed with the management)\n├── I think that's what they said in yesterday's councelling meeting\n│   └── did they give the exact seats for mains and kcet?\n│       └── No.... But if you are saying that there will be 60 seats for KCET ( assuming that it's 60 ) then there won't be much left for KCET after JEE.\n\nEdit: Considering that the -34 seats for JEE will be taken KCET\n│           ├── yup if its 60 then KCET seats for PES EC campus CSE will be less\n│           └── The exact number is 252(mains)+72(kcet).. i.e. 10% of the total seats in every branch is reserved for KCET 5 lac seats.... Prof Jawahar mentioned this in his latest interview..\n└── 5% is reserved for cet i think\n    └── that means 40% reserved for jee mains which is 288 for cs... highly unlikely considering that 34 seats were overbooked.. it will be around 10-15% for kcet\n        └── oh but thats what they said in counseling, maybe extra seats due to management or something?\n            └── Oh okay... maybe management seats then.. will wait and see... they will release the number of seats for kcet soon ig",
    "The overbooking seats are merged from pesu kcet so yeah it's. Over\n└── no 5% is left for cet",
    "Wtf does it mean when they write negative numbers??\n├── Overbooked seats\n└── overbooked   \nthey prolly hope that enough people will surrender their seats when kcet results come.",
    "Bro what does a minus indicate I didn’t understand that\n└── Overbooked seats\n    └── What does that mean. I’m getting PES through KCET. Will this affect the no if seats assigned to KEA counselling .\n        └── Idk..... Maybe they will decrease the seats for KCET from 60 to (60-34=)26 maybe they will have more no. of people in one batch.\n            └── WTFFFF . Bro I don’t think they can do that . KCET seats are already reserved . If they try to do anything with those seats, the KEA has full authority to take action against them.\n                └── Not the KCET Merit seats dude... the KCET 5 lac seats through PES counselling"
