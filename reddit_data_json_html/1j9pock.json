    "you only hate the world if the world has nothing to offer to you, do things that make you stand out, do things you genuinely enjoy and lose track of time doing, get so good at it people can't think of shit to say to you. That's all\n└── yeah lets try\n    └── Why not try to ignore them. I know it's going to be frustrating to you but it would be for them too. Also show them some attitude.\n        └── deal\n            └── Just make sure not to let any clg officials involve, or else it could be a mess.\n                └── 100 percent bro, involving higher auths doesnt always make stuff better\n                    └── 👍",
    "Fr this shit so ass bro I'm getting early arthritis cuz of this chut ass cllg",
    "you'll only understand how stressful work is after college.\nTrust me,I felt the same too,but work is even more stressful \nthere's nothing called weekend,work hours \nif work ain't done,do it by hook or crook\nenjoy your time at college,do what genuinely you are interested in.\nTake some time off,play some sport.\ncheers 🥂\n└── thanks for the heads up!!",
    "Do something about it ( not kys), in case this is a serious post, just ignore everyone making fun of you, the fire won't last if you take away the fuel. Maybe go to the gym while waiting till 5, nothing will change if you don't want to change\n└── lets try, most of the times i just laugh it off to show that i aint getting affected 100/100\n    └── Don't react at all, be there as if they don't exist. They are just words of people who are insignificant in your life\n        └── did that once and this person kept saying it again and again, the thing is i cant even say anything back because other person is female",
    "Staying till 5 pm while coming at 8 am does suck the soul out of me ngl.\nIf possible , get on bmtc/metro and go home, why bother staying till 5pm. Personally I wait for college bus everyday so not an option for me, I just play some pool/table tennis to pass time, or I head to the library.",
    "How did I survive school for the same timings😭\nAlso shoot up a dm op :)",
    "im doing my internship rn, trust me ur gonna miss this lmao",
    "Bro soldiers se inspiration lo, unko to ye hi nhi pta ki kal jinda bachenge bhi ya nhi, aur itna sb krne ke bawjood bhi unhe kuch khaas nhi milta in return",
    "why the fuck would someone downvote this post bruh im literally gonna cry",
    "1) If you gonna be staying till 5 make sure u use that extra time more productive or even have some fun there with new friends, i reccomend playing some video games ( if your into it ) , or even use that time to study something .\n\n2) As sem's go by i belive you will get new friends throughout your engineering , the true friends are gonna be with you no matter how much time pases .  About the making fun part , relly sry u get treated like that but i hope you just ignore those fools if your mental peace is being affected by that , some times its better to just ignore a problem rather than confront about it .\n\n3) Ignore this lady , Cant do anything to chutiya people like that \n\n4) Chill and calm down , if death is a solution to problems , a lot more people would be dieing everyday . Think logically , listen to your fav music and calm down , life is not all about clg you know :)\n└── yeah i literally use music as therapy",
