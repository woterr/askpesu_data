    "But do we want to be loyal?\n├── *\"To be or not to be\"*\n│   └── That question seems to extend beyond loyalty at PES these days\n└── I’d rather have my data deleted\n    └── Lol then they will claim u never graduated",
    "At this point we might as well call ourselves a cult",
    "Tryin to pass our trauma through generations 💯",
    "Forget about loyalty, if I ever die i would donate my middle finger to the management.\n└── 🤣🤣🤣👌🏻",
    "Only if they divert this time and attention in making other branches up to date except for CSE",
    "Applicable for the academic batch starting from 25/26\n└── Ig it's applicable from next year admissions not next batch\n    └── Isn't the same thing cause admission is only done once",
    "Bro what!",
    "Loyal to what shitty attendance rules ? 💀",
    "Bruh",
    "Great Marketing strategy but I don't know how are they expecting this from alumni. Nobody wants to visit clg after graduation specially pes but they are expecting alumni or their relatives to join pes really ??? Are they mad or what ??",
    "pyramid scheme ahh shit",
    "After applying with all the required documents and waiting for discount approval, now they are saying its only for new admissions not applicable to existing students.",
    "They want the torture to continue, making a business model out of it.",
    "Get stressed in 10 mins!"
