    "When did the third happen?\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Around 2 weeks ago.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ 3 suicides in the span of 6 months.\nâ””â”€â”€ I think it's the one 6 years ago?",
    "There are facilities for counselling already set up in the college... After the 1st one the HOD for CSE atleast came to each class to address the issue and reassured that there is someone that we can talk to if anything... What else can they do? Butt into your personal life? You wouldn't like it then would you? It's funny how the same people complain when there are rules to avoid these situations...\nâ””â”€â”€ This happened in which campus?\n    â””â”€â”€ RR, and also i heard one of the incidents, the second one was cuz of personal matters which the college can't handle? No one would love it if college starts getting into people's life.\n        â””â”€â”€ I am DM ing you",
    "Nothing tbh\nâ””â”€â”€ What kind of college is this?\n    â”œâ”€â”€ What are other colleges doing ? \nThere was a recent suicide in iitr and nothing happened\n    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Is that supposed to be a defence for pes?\n    â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ I am just saying other colleges aren't doing anything either .\nNot defending just stating the fact\n    â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ That doesn't mean PES shouldn't do anything.\n    â”‚       â”‚       â””â”€â”€ When iit r ain't doin shit u think pes is gonna\n    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Exactly ðŸ’¯\n    â””â”€â”€ My guy, do you have any other work then to sit and defame pes, which college are you from?",
    "PES is a pretty fucked up place. It's horrible that in one semester, three students have killed themselves on campus. Nobody should be in a situation where they feel like there's no other way out. The college hasn't even officially acknowledged these deaths or changed any of their policies or methods. There's so much unnecessary stuff that goes on in our college like the bouncers cracking down on us like we're criminals. In one of his addresses the VC literally said that he doesn't care about the students, he just cares about how the college is ranked. If you're expecting PES management to care about us, you're gonna be very disappointed. All we can do is look out for our friends and help them out when they're in a bad spot mentally\nâ””â”€â”€ Who is VC?\n    â””â”€â”€ The Vice Chancellor",
    "It is concering but don't expect them to do something about it. In the end most colleges only care about safeguarding their reputation.\nâ””â”€â”€ IKR!",
    "Built a gym",
    "Defended themselves and blamed everything on parents\nâ””â”€â”€ Really? How insensitive?"
