    "If you only care about getting a good job, you are better off picking CS-AIML. ECE students face an uphill battle when it comes to sitting for IT companies with CS students. There are more details on this in the FAQs. Picking CS-AIML here will give you practically the same opportunities placement-wise as CS students, so it gives you a better chance at landing a better package.\n\nOn an unrelated note and a little bit of unwanted advice:\n\n&gt;not had a specific intest in CSE or ECE right now ( ready to learn any )\n\nEngineering does not work like this. You cannot pick a random branch and dedicate 4 years of studying + the rest of your career by deciding like this. You have to show interest in what you are studying to do well in college and later in life too, otherwise, you are setting yourself up for a catastrophic crisis down the line. My suggestion would be to explore both your options and figure out what interests you. You cannot study for the sake of studying. The \"fake it till you make it\" ideology will crash and burn in front of your eyes when you realise you aren't happy because you aren't pursuing your interests or a career that can make you happy. You have time now - make a well-informed decision.",
