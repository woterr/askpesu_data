Also will questions be like basic level or will they ask hard application level questions.. im anxious about the 4 marker questions especially for maths. Any help will be appreciated ",

    "Don't expect direct questions, ISAs (and ESA) tend to be tricky for most courses. You will need to understand the concepts well to score in the tests - surface level knowledge or memorising slides won't cut it because most questions will require you to apply the concept. Prep advice is always simple: do whatever you can to prepare - slides, PYQs from ESAs, etc."
