  "content": "Basically, I messed up when I was filling the details in the NEST portal and entered the max marks for SSLC as 600 instead of 625. I don't know how I should rectify this. \n\nEdit #1: I noticed this 3 days later when my pesacademy portal got activated and saw my SSLC percentage was incorrect.\n\nAny help is much appreciated!",
