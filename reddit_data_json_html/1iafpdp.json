Any tips or resources would be super helpful!\n",

    "The best way to start off in a field is to get your hands dirty. If you are looking for a roadmap of sorts, the best approach is to ask people already working in that field about how to start off. After having extensively worked in a field, people often will have the answer to \"if I had to start over, how would I?\"\n\nThere's also https://roadmap.sh in case you don't find someone to reach out to, but that's unlikely since there's like 6k people on this subreddit and hundreds of active people on PESU Discord. Lots of seniors/alumni to reach out to for advice. Feel free to reach out there, or even on LinkedIn.\n\nTip: If you're looking to start out in ML, my detailed guide to starting out is on PESU Discord. Visit the edu (it's named something along those lines) forum channel and search for it."
