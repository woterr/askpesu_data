  "content": "Ok so this might sound kind of silly but I really need help here. Recently PESU academy was updated and now it's not compatible with my phone as my phone is an incredibly old model (Android 8.1). I have no money for a new phone. I tried searching on the web, but there is no apk file of the new app. Can someone, pls , create an apk file of the app and share it , especially for those whose phones aren't compatible? U basically need PESU app for many things and I can't keep logging into my computer at all times. Will be very helpful 🙏🏻",

    "APK is available on many sites....just google it. Can't talk about the security, though, but I used to use it because PESU App disappeared from playstore for a while, and apk was the only option, and it worked fine.\n└── Umm I'm having issues downloading the apk because of my android architecture, guess cannot do anything about it. ",
    "Is there something that you can only do with the android application that you can't do with the [website](https://pesuacademy.com/)\n├── Well the app is just more convenient to look up seating info and other stuff. \n└── It's just more convenient to use. U need to keep signing in all the time on the website which is kind of annoying. "
