    "There's this YouTube channel by this guy called razavi. He's the author of your textbook. It takes 20-30 hrs per unit but I guarantee it'll be worth it. Even if you've not attended a single acd class, you can learn everything properly from his vids. He's the sole reason I cleared acd. Just watch his vids and practice a few sums. You'll be set. Good luck!\n└── Oh, thanks a lot. I mean unit 1 was pretty chill 2 was horrible so I skipped it for ISA1. But then turns out you need unit 2 for 3 as well\n    └── Yea, unit 2, 3 and 4 are all connected. 1 and 5 are kinda standalone and you should focus on them first. 2 and 4 are manageable and 3 is usually the hardest for everyone. There's a lot of memorizing circuits and equations so be prepared for that"
