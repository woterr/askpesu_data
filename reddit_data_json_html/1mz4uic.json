    "I think they are going to take from the people shortlisted for dev itself.\nâ””â”€â”€ Well thatâ€™s insaneðŸ˜­\n    â””â”€â”€ Yeah, but surely they will hire just one or two from the shortlisted; So no hope from Lam\n        â””â”€â”€ Placements soo cooked ðŸ¥€\n            â””â”€â”€ Yeah, the number of companies visiting in next few weeks has suddenly dropped; Only some magic like the ibm mass hiring can save us now\n                â””â”€â”€ Dropped? Why?\n                    â””â”€â”€ Don't know man, like generally september and October are the peek of placements; But the number of companies is not even one per day, it was 1-2 per day during last academic year I guess.\n                        â””â”€â”€ That is honestly soo depressing ðŸ˜­\n                            â””â”€â”€ Yeah, with this market getting an offer off campus is much more difficult; We are totally cooked at this point\n                                â””â”€â”€ How many have gotten placed so far?"
