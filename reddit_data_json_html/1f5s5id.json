  "content": "A special middle finger to the entire PESU IT team. \n\nA little back story- I recently got shifted from ece to ai/ml and consequently my SRN was updated. Now bcz of that all my credentials also needed to be updated, my internet login credentials, pesuacademy and PESU mail id.   \nThe first 2 went smoothly but PESU mail id didn't. First they disabled my old PESU mail id, which contained a lot of useful but can-be-discarded emails and most importantly all the study material which I saved in my drive bcz of the free storage. Now I cannot access the study materials or the emails. I had also registered on a lot of stuff using my PESU mail. But now they assigned me a new email id, all great and problem solved, right?? NAWW how can it be, it's PESU after all, something needs to be special about them. These mfs forgot to give me the password for it. It's not displayed on PESUacademy or sent on my personal mail with which I registered to this uni. Now yesterday when I wrote to pesu official mail and the it team mail, they replied with \"please contact with your university mail provided to you\". Fucking clowns. A little back and forth happened and eventually they told me to forward this mail to some random pesu videos account which I never even heard of and I also missed my DSA lab submission through hackerrank yesterday bcz of this goof up.   \nSo yea, if I ever meet these retards I curse them that they keep stubbing their toe everyday to the corner of the table.  \nPeace out!",
