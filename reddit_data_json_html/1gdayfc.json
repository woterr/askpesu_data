    "There are total 10 experiments, even if you get 226/250 you will get 10 , So don't sorry\n└── So these 10 marks will be added to the ISA and ESA and total mark out of 100 will be calculated in chem right?\n    └── 40 isa , 50 esa , 10 assignment, 10 for lab record , 10 for lab exam \nTotal will be 120 , then they will scale it down to 100\n        └── Oh i see... so in eng mech/epd it will be out of 100 as there are no labs...\n            └── Yeah",
    "iirc Chem lab is for a total of 250 marks, so as long as you get above 225/230 you'll get 10/10 for that lab",
