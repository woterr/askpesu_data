  "content": "Kullu came at 3:50PM and the event properly started at that particular time but wait, after making us wait for so long Stage and Infra decided to surprise us with their poor audio systems in 1st and 2nd floor. Can’t hear anything in the above stands. Highly disappointing. This is a huge blunder. All of us need a refund along with compensation for mental trauma.",

    "Everyone else is laughing at the jokes while we are waiting to atleast hear what he's saying\n❤️da experience",
    "From more than 30 min they are telling we will increase sound🫠 we cant. Hear anything but the laughter of the students who can hear",
    "At this point the audience might be wondering whether to laugh at his comedy or the blunder of the organizers.",
    "No offense but why do y'all attend these dogsh!t events offered by PESU that too at such high price?  \nIf you are a second/third year, you'll know how terrible even the last one was, so shoulda assumed it'll be the same shit this year too\n├── 300 is a decent price for a standup show I think plus its seated and air conditioned which is nice. Ignoring the horrible infra pes had, the jokes were decent and it was fun overall. Also these events are a social thing you go because theres friends who go with you.\n├── His event was good for vip for general it was not audible at all\n│   └── rip\n└── Comedy nite for kullu at 300/- is a pretty good price, and this time they've seated us in the auditorium, last year it was in the back gate ground which was terrible, some issues are always expected, overall comedy nite was pretty good tbh",
    "Actually artist is good the management is shitty happens in all the events"
