    "yes, verilog only.\n└── Why bro, when they have already taught us system verilog, why again go through the pain of learning new syntax\n    ├── this time its for a different purpose, u will understand i think. \n\nI didnt take the elective, so I will leave it here for others to ask\n    └── It’s not the same syllabus as CADD, it’s what’s next in Verilog after cadd. You will be exposed to more aspects in chip manufacturing , design, synthesis"
