  "content": "I completed my admission in 23rd but the app hasn't updated anything. It's giving me a timetable for all semesters, I don't have a class assigned to me, and no SRN number. Anyone facing the same issue? Did the first round KCET students and the PESSAT students have the same problem and it fixed itself afterwards?",

    "your SRN will be generated in a few days and you will be alloted a class, when does your class start? they usually give out classes a day or 2 before it begins\n└── Gonna start on 30th",

    "Sm here bro",
    "My srn is still not generated ..it's been two days since my admission...and also there is no update about the class",
