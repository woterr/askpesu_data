    "Quite easily, in fact it is harder to stay in classes, take holiday every day as long as you have friends who put proxy!\n├── How did you survive 10 years in PES?\n\n(flair)\n│   └── See bro, they are big fan of me, they refused to give degree till I clear backlogs\n├── So they don't care if you are actually there or not? And what if we had to bunk a particular class? Don't the professors notice us?\n│   └── If you have never been to college, they wouldn’t know who you are, so no one would notice\n└── What if you are a hostler? Won't the warden notice?\n    ├── Warden is responsible for whole of boys hostel, doesn't care u can stay in hostel 24/7 as long as u get proxy and have &gt;75 attendance\n    ├── Bhai pehele clg join hojao ache friends banao \nMoj masti karo koi bhi puchega nahiii \n1st year fullyyy jollyyy becoming \n2nd year se grind karo\n    └── Warden doesn't give a flying fuck unless you fail to give attendance or get caught doing drugs",
    "Nobody cares in cse. As long as u make sure your attendance is above 75%(strictly), ur free to do whatever\n└── Ok thanks 👍",
    "Just keep ur attendance above 75% at all times. After that no one cares\n└── What if you are a hostler? Won't the warden notice?\n    └── No",
    "I have walked out of class as soon as teacher left, and the next class teacher was standing outside. its very easy, just walk out. Student is KING 😂",
    "Make sure your attendance is above the minimum required 75%, otherwise nobody really cares lol",
    "You can leave the class when it starts and go anywhere you want. Nobody gives a shit. If you dont have 75% attendance also, the week before your ESA, you can sit in your class to cover up. Go to cafeteria, gjbc or go and play basketball in the parking lot. Go and camp outside the Registrar's office, and they still wont give a shit. Just make sure your HOD doesnt see you. They are usually the only ones who give a shit.\n└── Yeah thanks man for the complete guide 👍🤣",
    "Just checking......",
    "It depends on the teacher. Some demand 85%, others don't mind you having a minimum of 75%."
