  "content": "One of my close friends recently received an offer from one of the WITCH companies. However, they seem reluctant to accept it, saying it’s not something they truly want to do. I understand wanting to follow your interests, but given the current job market and how hard it is for many people to get offers, I’m a bit concerned.\n\nIt seems like a decent starting point with structured training and job security, especially when so many freshers are still struggling. Am I overthinking this, or is it okay for them to pass it up in hopes of something better?",

    "It really depends on his capabilities.\n\nIf he can bag a witch summer internship, he can bag a 6 month and fte pretty easily as well. \n\nSo no harm in trying for more right. Trying to upskill, and make yourself better. \n\nAnd worst case he loses a couple months of witch pay and experience. The pay won't matter too much and neither will the experience to a huge extent"
