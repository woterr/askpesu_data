    "They will ask questions based on OOPS, Networking, DSA and there will be some on DBMS too but atleast for me, they didnt ask DBMS, it was more of networking based questions, bcoz Cisco is a networking company\n\nAnd also, for the coding questions, it will be leetcode medium - hard &amp; Codeforces Div 1 level \n\nOverall, it will be difficult, not so easy\n├── Thank you so much\n└── any questions of dsa that u think are sure to come in exam .we have 40 mcqs and 2 dsa questions so any specifics if u can tell....\n    └── Dont remember now, sorry. U can check online",
