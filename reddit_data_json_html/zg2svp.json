    "Lmao this was all beacuse of lack of quality teachers, when even asked simple questions they stumble, and then i do find out its very simple mistake i have made,these not so good teachers just keep giving free marks even though students answers are wrong in isa and also if their assignments  are copied they r not checked well.so students just byheart and then now everyone s grade is very very less",
    "When many students flunk in a subject , a sort of relative grading is done . It usually limits to one subject per sem and in third sem it's usually done for DS.",
    "Did you open the textbooks nd solve the questions or only did the slides?\n└── Yep i did, unfortunately i left out one topic and 4 questions came from that lol\nBut I'm guessing it'll be relative for sure\n    └── Yeah i remeber for dsa in 3rd sem, i left one 10 marks question and still got A since it was relative.\nAfaik if the whole batch performs bad, it's relative for sure.\nAtb!"
