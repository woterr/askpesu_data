    "Hey, only you know what's right for you, or a professional. If you're confident in your decision, focus on that, pes is good enough as well. No one else can tell you what you are like, especially when it's such BS. Don't take their negative criticism seriously, just let it pass over your head for your sanity, don't be discouraged! Believe in yourself and I'm proud of you for coming so far in your journey, stay strong!\n└── thank you so much for motivating me and helping me out",
    "I was more or less in the same spot, with all my cousins being in Bits, iiit, iit and so on, so the pressure was real. Everyone kept saying take a drop, I was just very stubborn on getting out after first attempt and I ended up landing in PES and my parents are glad that I took that decision instead of dropping. Dropping is useless if you aren't ready for it.",
    "Don't care about your parents,some parents say that to their guests so as to act humble,they say like they will not do anything but in reality they trust you",
    "Focus on your exam, ignore all negative remarks. Sometimes parents say things out of fear and insecurity but they are actually worried about us. Not saying your mom is correct, just that she must be worried n so the rant. Calm yourself n u will shine through. All d best!!!",
    "Parental pressure and guidance is hoax, they don't know shit. Believe what you want to believe and live your life how you really want to, parents eventually give in and you're not bad for doing it. If you yourself think it's right",
    "bruv just ask your mom how much she got in her mains. That shud solve ur problems as well her problems towards you"
