  "content": "As the title reads\n\nDoes anyone know the reason why these people don't have footages of main block 5th floor CCTV footages? \n\nI needed the footage of classroom 500 for some reason and followed all the procedures and at last they tell that they don't have footages. They even claim that there's only one control room for all the CCTVs.\n\nAnyone has any idea from where else can I get those footages? If yes, drop a comment or DM, it'll be very helpful",
