    "Even I had nearly 7 in 2nd year but I grinded third year and got 9 both sems and able to sit for atleast half the placement exams and got T1 company don’t lose hope!",
    "Aight dude.. GPA ain't the end of the world.. get your head out of the phone tho.. look around and try to connect with a few of your peers. Try doing some projects on your own.. look into the internet for actual teachers.. have fun while ur doing all this.. play some games and shit.. try joining some clubs and interacting there.. ur life ain't over just cause u have a bad gpa..",
    "I relate soo much to you!\nAs a person with a cgpa&lt;7 and in second year rn, it does feel like everything’s gone downhill \nNever made friends, haven’t spoken to even a single person other than my roommate\nIt felt like hell, but eventually i got used to it, perhaps being alone didn’t feel lonely after a while\nAnyways,we relate so much , in case you wanna be friends? hmu!",
    "Don't do any shit(suicide) while you are in this phase \nLife is greater than gpa 🙏\n└── Definitely not ☠️☠️",
    "Why tf are you guys like this? Damn!! You guys are acting like there’s not a million other careers to choose from…… \n\n\nAnd btw CGPA of 7 isn’t as bad as you think… just have some good projects…..\n\nps : College is meant to be enjoyable not miserable🤦‍♂️",
    "Bro, try making some friends. Being alone is contributing to your depression, and friends could help with it. This will allow you to focus on your studies.",
    "a lot of people are on the same boat dude.\ni don’t think you should stress a lot and you should start working on yourself.\nyou still have two more years.\nyou still have the chance to get over 8 gpa if you work hard.\nbut gpa is not the only criteria to succeed in  college.\ncollege life is amazing, you won’t get it ever.\nso try joining clubs, make friends, go out.\nmake the best out of it.\nand if you ever feel shitty in life, talk to somebody.\ntrust me life gets shittier after college.\nif i had a chance to go back in time, i’d go back to my college days.\nall the best!\n└── Definitely I'll use your suggestion thank you 🙂",
    "Leave the past. Don't compare it with the present or future. Stay calm and try to make full use of the opportunities you have. When you feel lonely, talk to someone. Listen to some nice music. It's soothing. It's not easy to get into a good college. When you could make it, then you have something in your right. That feeling should boost your energy and get the best of you. You'll be fine, don't worry. Everything is temporary:)",
    "As someone who’s passed out of PES and doing decently good at life. All of this shit doesn’t even matter in 6 months, no one’s going to ask your CGPA or who is the topper. All the toppers in my class got placed for tier 2/3 or either unemployed . Don’t chase marks, it doesn’t matter. \n\nFind what you would love to do in life, that’s what those 4 years are for. Try everything, see what you love to do in life and chase it. Marks cgpa Louda also won’t matter once you pass out",
    "Leave no matter what advice ppl give ppl like you won't learn\n└── Really 🤣 , I'll prove you that you are wrong 👾\n    └── Nice that was my intention"
