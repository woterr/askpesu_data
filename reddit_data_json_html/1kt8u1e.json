    "It will be 7.88/10. Almost all unis will ask you to report on the original scale, which is out of 10. There is no \"official\" way to convert from 10-scale to 4-scale, each uni uses its own conversion system. For example, UCI uses the following GPA converter: [https://gpa.eng.uci.edu](https://gpa.eng.uci.edu)\n└── Cool, thanks .what unis do you think would be reasonable to target in your opinion? I’m interning rn and would have a year’s experience along with a research paper in hand.\n    └── Can't generalise and predict, although something around T20-T50. It depends a lot on your fit with the program and uni, as well as a bit of luck."
