    "I spoke to coe office in ec campus and they told me that the re-eval results have not been updated yet for 2nd yrs\n├── Ok\n└── Is it updated for 3rd year ?\n    └── Not sure, didn't ask about that\n        └── Are the grades being shown in final results for you (2nd year) ?\n            └── Yes but generally we get that remark saying whether the grade has changed or not. That hasn't shown up yet.\n                └── Yeah you are right ! Revaluation results shows up like No change or Grade changed from A to S kinda thing. But they keep changing stuff like emailing scholarship and no list and all that so was confused\n                    └── Have they sent the mail already for scholarships?",
    "Bruh they're already out\nCheck website and if it says final results, reval is out"
