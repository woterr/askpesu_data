  "content": "I am considering ARVR+RTOS for my 5th sem electives. I have a reasonably good cgpa (8.6) and i dont mind 1 somewhat difficult subject. I've been through a bit of reddit scrolling and learning what would the best choice be.  \nI cannot find any real information on either ARVR or RTOS.  \nAre they easy? Are they difficult in some aspects?  \nWould a different choice like DA+BD be better even if it is hectic?  \nAre there any statistics for these subjects?  \nWhat do the projects in both look like?  \n",

    "ARVR is very very easy dw, very simple ISA and ESA. only one project will be there, using unity or smtg, u can do it, if u team up with someone who knows those tools very well\n└── Do you know anything about RTOS or know anyone that does?\n    └── nope, no idea",
    "ARVR was easy for our batch and RTOS generally gets cancelled according to previous trends"
