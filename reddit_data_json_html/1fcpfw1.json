  "title": "Can I back out of a special topic course I had selected earlier?",
  "content": "I am in 7th sem right now and I had not completed any special topics before. So it was mandatory for me to select all 5 special topics at once. I had taken Reinforcement learning as one of the topics and I'm really regretting it a lot now. When I finished machine intelligence in sem 5, I thought that I'm really done with machine learning, but I couldn't select the other subject which is advanced digital forensics because I had to complete another course prior which I had not. I am going through the college provided playlist which has all the video lessons for the topic, but I'm unable to understand anything. Is there any way to drop out of this course and change? Can I shift to another special topic if I get a backlog in this subject? ",
