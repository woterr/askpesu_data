    "No use studying from now , there's loads of theory so u might lose interest early. It's the polar opposite of sem 3. 4th sem was the worst for us due to 1 day study gap between esas of all subjects and no relative grading\n└── How difficult is sem 4 compared to sem 3?\n    ├── Different kind of difficulty compared to sem 3. Cn requires u to understand the theory properly, daa contains a huge no of algorithms to remember, os is just infinite amounts of theory stuffed in 4 chapters, mpca is a lot better than ddco but it's esa was the worst I have given in pes , la was easy but the esa marking was really bad , with even above average people getting cs and ds. If u are okay with studying large amounts of theory over the hands on stuff of sem 3 then it would be easier for u\n    └── Personally I feel that it is more difficult. Especially CN. My cgpa increased from sem 1 to sem 3. It fell hard after sem 4",
