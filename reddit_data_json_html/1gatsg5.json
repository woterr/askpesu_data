    "Slides and notes is enough for the theory part. \n\nPractice writing entire codes because all the 4 markers in ISAs are related to writing/filling codes. If I remember correctly they copy pasted a few questions directly from the slides.",
    "YouTube is your best friend",
    "Ya for theory PPT and notes are enough\n\nBut for 1M and 2M  you need to study out of the books.",
    "I just heard kundavaiâ€™s classes \nAnd scoring S was simple",
    "No you need to practice just to be sure you don't miss any syntax. Without that you probably will have a backlog. Even missing the smallest thing will make you lose marks."
