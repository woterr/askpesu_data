Coz next sem Phy cycle exams are held in june so like will we have an exam before that??\n    └── You have a delayed semester. It'll happen during your summer break.\n        └── Does it show anywhere if I get back ? Like during placements or anything"

Because it'll make it difficult for preparation if you give it during your next sem exams.\n└── Thank you! And also do you know the maximum grade that can be attained in backlog exam i asked this before but no one seems to have a clear idea🤷‍♂\n    └── Yes, there are maximum of grade you can take at once for exams. I'm not sure of the number. Let me get back to you on this.\n        └── Thank you i appreciate it really!😭 please get back to me abt this..🤧\n            └── For my batch it was a C grade (2022 outgoing)"

Its surprising to see so many people struggling to give a year-1 subject. Very less pass. So be very very careful. Do not shy away from faculty. They will guide you most definitely.\n└── Heyy thank you the thing is its my first time failing and im like depressed frm thn😭"
