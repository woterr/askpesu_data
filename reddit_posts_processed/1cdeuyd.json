How will you know which score resulted in which rank? \n\nPESSAT is completely computer based, there are no previous year question papers, and only your rank is provided to you. Since it takes place over multiple dates, your score is normalised and then a rank is assigned, but there is no way to determine how much you scored or what is needed for a particular rank. And with negative marking this year onwards, don't listen to people who say \"I went in without prep and got CS\" or \"I marked everything randomly and got CS\". Things will be significantly different this year.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Can you explain why things will be significantly this year?\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Primarily because of no negative marking. Before, everyone would attempt all 180 questions, even if they knew the answer or not. That's not possible this year. Guesswork comes with potential risk now.\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ Mkay\nâ”‚           â””â”€â”€ It's the same as JEE lol  \n+4 and -1 is the same as +1 and -0.25\nâ”‚               â””â”€â”€ Exam feels unfair with negative marking, 4 times twice the questions in jee with a disadvantge\nâ”‚                   â””â”€â”€ Exactly this is kinda unfair.. But its for everyone, so dw about it\nâ””â”€â”€ Yo , do you know if ranking is done shiftwise like in JEE?"
