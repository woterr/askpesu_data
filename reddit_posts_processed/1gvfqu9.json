      "body": "Your seating allotment *can* change within a single ISA (and ESA too). It is not uncommon. Always remember to double-check your seating allotment before the exam. There have also been multiple incidents of it getting updated a few hours before an exam, so the recommendation is always to check 30 mins before an exam as well.\n├── Omg\n├── Promptly kicked out was nice\n├── wait can it change even after the seating info has come for the exam the previous night?\n│   └── How will it change *during* the exam lmao. What are you, Schrodinger's cat?\n\nBut yes, sometimes the seating allotment goes through changes and usually gets fixed only an hour or so before the exam. That's why - always keep checking and make one final check 15 mins before the exam.\n│       └── the results are gonna be like schrodingers cat :>\n└── Hows that assignment going ?"
