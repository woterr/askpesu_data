      "body": "Financially, MSRIT is a no brainer. But I'm highly against such specialised branches (especially for a pedantic field like ML) at undergraduate level because it restricts you and can backfire, and most people also don't know what they're getting into. \n\nWhen it comes to Ivy Leagues for MS, both Uni's are seen equally so it doesn't make a difference. Your profile will matter. Unless you're from the top Indian Uni's (IIT and the like), most Uni's are seen under the same umbrella. However, what you want to pursue for your MS should be relevant to what you take up now. In case you don't like AI, then switching to a different specialised programme during MS might be difficult to explain with AI as your branch. However going from CS to a specialised branch is always pretty much the norm because that's how things are supposed to be.\n\nSaid this, pick whichever you think will help you now and in the long run. Make an informed decision now so it doesn't backfire later. You can DM me if you need any more help."
