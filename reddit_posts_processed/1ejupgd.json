  "content": "I would greatly appreciate your insights on how challenging it is to change branches within VTU-affiliated colleges, for example, shifting from a specialization like Data Science and AI to a general Computer Science major. Additionally, do you think itâ€™s wise to start with branches such as Computer Science Design or IoT at DSCE, with the intention of potentially changing to another specialisation later? Your advice would be immensely valuable.",
