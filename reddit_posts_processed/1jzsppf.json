      "body": "Why do you need a NOC if you are interning during the summer? You simply won't be given credits for it. PES doesn't care if you intern during the session breaks.\n├── Will June - Aug will be full summer off for us?\n│   └── Depends on when your academic session began but that's the usual summer break when there are no delays. Check the FAQs.\n└── Actually PES only gives NOC for the summer. I tried to get one for 6 months starting June but was refused and had to cut short my internship to 2 months.\n    └── Thats because you aren't permitted to intern during the semester unless it's the 8th semester.\n        └── But even for summer I was asked to submit an NOC and PES gave me one"
