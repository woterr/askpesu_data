After that week classrooms are alloted and classes start right away.\nâ”‚       â”‚       â””â”€â”€ So you're telling me that I can skip classes next week. Thanks for letting me know lol!\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ is the timings same if I join after round 2?\nâ”‚           â””â”€â”€ i wasnt in a section with kcet round 2 students, but from what i had heard, there are extra classes to cover up the syllabus you miss, so you may not get half days\nâ”‚               â””â”€â”€ ![gif](giphy|TW8Ma1a8ZsZ8I)\nâ””â”€â”€ Schedule is very hectic ðŸ˜”"
