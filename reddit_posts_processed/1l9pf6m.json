      "body": "Curfew - Come back before 10pm and ull be good. \n\nFood - There's 3 messes , personally I have no problems the food is pretty good. Im a vegetarian tho but they I know they give non veg around 3 times a week.\n\nGym - Campus gym is available till 7:15pm and its very close to hostel\n\nLaundry services are inside hostel , there's a good study room , small table tennis,foozball , carrom and chess area and a vending machine. That's pretty much it. Rooms are good , especially the ones with the attached bathroom and wifi works fine. \n\n  \nThe only cons are that it's hard to get hostel right now because of the demand\n├── is the curfew the same for boys and girls? also if i am not a bangalore resident will i get one of the newer blocks easily?\n└── Is there any problem with common bathrooms in boys hostel( rr campus) , and will it be crowded in morning ?"
