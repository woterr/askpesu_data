  "content": "Can any senior working in companies like IBM, Cisco, VISA, PayPal, Walmart, Juniper, Nvidia etc. please let us know (if you know) when these companies will come to PES for hiring? These companies seem to be the regular ones that visit PES over the years. \n\nAfter seeing our current terrible placement scenario compared to the previous batch and still unplaced, I am starting to freak tf out. I want to get a good placement after paying so much fees :(",

It will be many months after all the other big shots come. \n\nBro placements just started, why are u feeling sad, so many companies will still come dont worry, it will go on for a year anyway\n├── What kind of skills does nvidia look for?\n│   └── https://preview.redd.it/8zjecmzyeslf1.png?width=706&format=png&auto=webp&s=21322213d59ef81d504be573779d833455648c64\n\n\n\nSomething like this - for Software engineering Intern.\n│       └── What roles do they come for\n│           └── hardware engineering and software engineering - only two\n│               └── So what cs/ec/ee uh eligibility\n│                   └── yep, that is standard.\n└── Curious, any idea whether Juniper comes as a separate entity for hiring now that the HPE acquisition completed?\n    └── ooh I think in that case, HPE will come and hire talent then, because for our batch they had come for these roles - \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kacq69dzkwlf1.png?width=1385&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2806fa173353d516df9750ccede32f4d16afb8d\n        └── Yep your batch’s JD looks like the standard HPE Aruba, Compute and Storage hiring that they’ve done for so many years.\n\nIt might be the case that this year onwards Juniper hiring might be done as part of HPE itself, similar to Aruba hiring. Worth looking into for current students u would say.\n            └── yeah yeah, cool cool 👍"

They already say there overhired last yr(hearing it frm a friend).\n\nPaypal was offcampus and so is Cisco through hackathon.\n\nNvidia comes for intern only and hires very less like 1 or 2. \n\nJuniper came in October but this year they wont come. Theyll come as combined HPE hiring.\n\nWalmart came in september and November. VISA came in October.\n\nUnpopular opinion: In 2025 even though the best month of placement was August due to IBM hiring so much. But many of the best wellknown companies honestly came in Oct(end) to November time ngl.\n\nAlso eventually everyone gets placed. Its all about the time u get. Some maybe late, some early. So dont worry much."
