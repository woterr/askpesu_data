There was an option to choose courses last year. but this year you have to earn them either by interning at a company or college centers.  \nyou have to earn 6 credits in total for internships . You can either choose (2+4) combo or (2+2+2) combo or 6 credit combo for internships.  \n\\- if you have  done an internship before 8th sem during your 2nd year OR 3rd year summer(worth 2 credits only). you can choose(2+4) combo, 4 credits can be earned during 8th sem.  \n\\- if you have done  more than 1 internship before 8th sem during your 2nd year AND 3rd year summer(each worth 2 credits only). you can choose (2+2+2) combo. 2 credits can be earned during 8th sem.  \n\\- if you have done an internship during 8th sem , you can get 6 credits directly from 8th sem.  \n\n\nThese (2+4) (2+2+2) and 6 combos can be choosen for your GRADING of 6 total credits.If you have taken multiple internships but you think you can get an S grade purely of 6 credit instead of a (2+2) or (2+4) combo, you can give the 6 credit internship for your grading, you can choose what internships you want to be graded from."
