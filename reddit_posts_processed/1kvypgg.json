      "body": "Alongside just applying on linkedin or company websites, could outreach to people and startups on linkedin is probably your best bet. You could also see if you could shadow any of your relatives or people in your network like a custom internship.\n\nThere’s like 3 ways to go about: \n\nYou can reach out to people at firms where you would like to potentially intern, ask if you can speak to them to learn about their experience and get advice to get to where they are. If you have a good conversation, you can ask if there’s any way you can contribute over the summer or ask to be connected to someone else. Ask them if they know of any leads or opportunities in their network.\n\nYou can directly reach out to people or recruiters and ask if there are any internship opportunities at the firm they work at.\n\nYou can reach out to startups and ask if you can help out over the summer. Express that you’re willing to do anything to help out and learn for zero pay. \n\nIt’s a numbers game. Try reaching out as much as you can, and expect a super high rejection rate. But you potentially only need one response to lead to something.\n\nI did this in my second year of PES (I was in BTech however) and got an unpaid financial modelling internship with a real estate company. So speaking from experience."
