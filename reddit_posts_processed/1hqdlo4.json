  "content": "This happened to me while I was a student at PES on eve of 2020. The management forced everyone to be inside hostel by 5pm instead of 9. A lot of batches were anyways gone home for vacation while I had to deal with classes and isa. \n\nThe lame restrictions were put in place to make our new year as boring as possible. All type of celebrations were banned including cakes.\n\nWith nothing else to do I was on phone with a friend of mine. When a staff member opened the door, said something started giving me a lecture during which I had to cut my call. Called rest of my batchmates into the corridor and all given lectures for creating commotion. What a rude welcome in the new year. And all of us being the responsible adults gave a smug look and listened on.\n\nPlot twist we cut our new year cake after sometime But it was a just miss. Don't exactly remember if cake cutting was banned but the management then liked to take out all the happiness out of the inmates.",
