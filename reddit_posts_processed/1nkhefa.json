      "body": "Why do you need an instagram page to make friends, CosmicSeducer? Have you all forgotten how to make friends organically? There must be 60ish students in your class whom you spend 8 hours on average with, talk to them and find common ground to build friendship.\n└── Bro i’m not talking about that\nI have interacted with them and made many friends in class. I just wanted to make friends outside my classroom in different sections and stuff.\nAnd talking about insta page i was referring to freshers page of pes just like every college has one.\n    ├── I mean, just go to their classroom and talk. Not an issue right?\n    └── Still don't see how having an instagram page helps with that. Get out of your class, talk to people, take part in events and activities. Have you kids forgotten how to socialise without social media?"
