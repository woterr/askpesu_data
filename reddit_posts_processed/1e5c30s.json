Specialisations are often offered as electives which you will need to take up. If you take the CSE branch, you'll instead have the opportunity to actually make that *choice* and choose your elective, unlike specialisations where you will be forced to take it to get the specialisation. The reason this is bad is because as a Fresher, you *may* not have much idea about those specialisations and might not know what you are interested in. You never know if you will like it or not.\n\n>Restricting yourself to a specialisation now even before finding out what all it comprises of is in my opinion atleast, very risky. Choosing core CSE will allow you to explore and find out different fields you actually might be interested in, and help you take better decisions about which electives to take and specialisations to opt for. There are more answers to this question on this subreddit, search and you'll find multiple with the same opinion. Don't choose anything now, go with CSE at RVCE or PES."

The placement cell in PES is second to maybe RVCE only in the whole of Karnataka imo (I'm talking about tiet 3 colleges , not including IIT NITs)\n└── Quick question, is PES and RV tier 2 or tier 3 ?\nThanks\n    ├── The tier system is ambiguous and made up by students. There is no right answer, just know that RV and PES have equivalent reputations.\n    └── I see people saying \nIIT = tier 1\nNIT = tier 2\nRest all other colleges - tier 3\n\nSo I classified both PES and RV in tier 3\nEven though I feel they can give even the NITs a run for their money"
