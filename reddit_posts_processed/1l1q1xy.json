      "body": "Mostly at this pesu rank you will get ece in main campus and in manipal you are getting cs with scholarship also as your rank is under 5k . Also placements wise pesu= manipal . So I would suggest you to take mit for cs\n└── Oo people were comparing pessat ranking for this counselling rank and I thought I'll get aiml at least since the counselling process is so shit I thought if I might get lucky then cs too :(\n    ├── No one's sure . You may get ai ml or ece only I feel m cs there is very slight chance as ppl won't leave that easily\n    │   └── So I didn't have ece as preference it was cse and ai in both campuses .\n\nIn general too about pesu and manipal what should I prefer?\n    │       └── I feel placements wise both are same . For a great college life you can choose manipal .\n    └── You shouldn't be taking counseling advice from someone who doesn't know how the system works. I don't know why you kids keep doing the same thing. \n\nNobody can predict. If anyone claims they can, they're just lying.\n        └── Yaa I know that I'm not sure too about counselling my main question was since I got this much ranking should I straight away go ahead with mit or should also sit for pesu\n\nAlso this would just be taken as an advice and in now way a deciding factor for me it's just to get a clearer picture if will I be missing anything.\n            └── You can predict your branch at Manipal, not at PES. I'd say, go with Manipal."
