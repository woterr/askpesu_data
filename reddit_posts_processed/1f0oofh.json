  "content": "It looks as if the second round Pessat counselling date isn't gonna be postponed owing to the fact that kea has released it's schedule (which they hopefully stick to) and there is no change in the second round date until now. If the second round takes place before kcet first allotment, will they still change the seat from pessat  quota to kcet quota(when alloted)? I have submitted the originals wrt Pessat ",
