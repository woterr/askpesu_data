No need to take such small matters to such scenarios like doing assignments and what.people doing research also quote several articles.does that mean stealing.i just wanted an answer wrt ece . Your post is not some research level article or something .\n        â””â”€â”€ and changing name is different and changing branch is different . I wanted to know  first year stuff with ece."
