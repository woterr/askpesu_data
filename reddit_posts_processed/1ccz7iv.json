  "title": "PES SAT 2024: Nervous About Random Guesses Impacting My CSE Chances!",
  "content": "I recently took the PES SAT 2024 exam and attempted around 118 questions. Out of these, I’m confident about 85 questions, but for the rest, I had to resort to random guessing, considering the negative marking. Despite my efforts, I’m uncertain about securing a CSE seat. I’ve heard stories about people getting CSE at EC  or ECE departments even without preparation. Can anyone who has been in a similar situation or a senior share their experience? How does normalization factor into this? I’d appreciate any insights or advice. Thank you.",

      "body": "I wouldn't go by previous stories since there wasn't any negative marking before. Since the test is held across different dates, a normalisation of scores takes place and only after that your rank is determined. There's no way to say for sure how much you'll or what your rank will be, so it's best to just know that you've given it your all and wait for the results."
