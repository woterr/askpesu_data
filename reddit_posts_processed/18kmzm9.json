Like for an example, if a student does really bad in sem 1 and does exceptionally well in second sem 2 or vice versa, will he still qualify for the scholarship or one has to perform well in both the sems?? Also, is sgpa considered or cgpa??",

      "body": "There are 2 main scholarships. This has been the case for the past 2 years. I am not sure of the changes this year but they'll mostly remain the same.   \n\n\nThe scholarships are:  \n1. MRD Scholarship given to the top 20% of students based on SGPA of the semester. They'll give you back 40% of the semester fees. That is around 72k if you're a PESSAT student.   \n2. CNR Rao Scholarship given to the top 2% of students based on CGPA. This CGPA is calculated including your current semester's SGPA. This gives you back 50% of your semester fees.   \n\n\nNote that by 'semester fees', I just mean annual fees / 2\n└── I saw somewhere that 10000 had to be paid first? Is that only for cet students?\n    └── Yes, that's only for KCET students. That's a one time fee to be eligible for the scholarships.\n        └── Hey the thing is I've paid the scholarship fee and we're gonna have our ESA in 3 days but I don't have an union Bank account yet will that be a problem (assuming I'll be eligible for the scholarship once results come out)"
