I had asked one from AT team and they had told me that AT is only for PES ppl this time\n        â””â”€â”€ That's weird, do you know why? Usually AT is open to everyone. I myself have bought tickets after graduating.\n            â”œâ”€â”€ I heard that The contract with artists says pes exclusive\n            â”‚   â””â”€â”€ That doesn't add up because this is a chance to make more money by including outsiders. Plus, outsider tickets have always coated more afaik\n            â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ Maybe to reduce the crowd and increase the quality of the fest for our university students itself\n            â”‚       â””â”€â”€ I think its artists preference at the end of day. Not sure exactly, but the reason cud be to reduce crowd maybe?\n            â””â”€â”€ There is a lot of drama with AT this time\nMainly in regards to mohith chauhan.\n                â””â”€â”€ Ooooh I smell tea.
