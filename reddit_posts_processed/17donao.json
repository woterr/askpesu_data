The language has to be assembly language for single cycle Risc-v processor\n            └── Do a loop unrolling project\nOn ripes\n                └── Thanks I'll look into it"

Search for research papers. \\[This is, if you want to do a *very-good project and that you want to be a highlight in your resume*\\]. \n\nBut if you want to do a simple project and *hate* this subject, just do some sorting algorithm in assembly language. That should be it. But explain nicely in class.\n└── Ok I'll check it out thanks for your response"
