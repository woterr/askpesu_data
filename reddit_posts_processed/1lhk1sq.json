  "content": "I have my Mechanics ESA tommorow. So naturally, I was looking for a way to kill time. Ended up drawing a few manga panels. Yes, it's on the back of my Mechanics notebook. I don't know what I was thinking when I drew it (was definitely high on something). I just made a panel layout and drew whatever would fit in each panel. It ended up looking pretty good for a mindless, time pass sketch. I thought the title \"Dream Crushed (Dore-Ä«mu Kurusshu)\" was pretty fitting lol. Posting it here, so it may be engrained in the PESU Memes Hall fo Fame.\n\nP.S.: Best of luck to everyone who has ESAs ongoing right now!",

For ãƒ‰ãƒªãƒ¼ãƒ ã‚¯ãƒ©ãƒƒã‚·ãƒ¥, the ãƒƒ and ãƒ¥ are small kana so they should be a bit smaller and slightly below the other characters. \n\nAnd for Speedbird-ãƒ¯ãƒ³ (wan), it looks like youâ€™ve written ãƒ¯ã‚½ (waso) instead. Make the curve slightly flatter and itâ€™s perfect.\nâ””â”€â”€ Thank you for pointing that out. I am not familiar with the Japanese writing system. I just used Google Translate and tried my best to copy the characters. I'll be sure to take note of that.\n    â”œâ”€â”€ Ah ok perfectly all right then. No need to worry about it. You actually did a superb job just from copying\n    â””â”€â”€ Drop a yt tutorial with your goated skills"
