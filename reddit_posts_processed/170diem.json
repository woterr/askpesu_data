Don't worry and work hard you can bring it to 8. 5th and 6th sem will give a boost to your cgpa. 8ish is more than enough for placements.\n└── Are you from pes rr cse too ?\n    └── I'm from ec campus CSE.\n        └── Ohh are you placed now ?\n            └── Yup I have one offer for fte.\n                └── Damn thanks for making me feel better and not worthless !\n                    ├── Lmao np 🙏. Only advice I can give is stay proactive.

Your resume has to be able to stand on its own without cgpa. \n\nImagine yourself as the recruiter. Would you want to employ someone who's done nothing but study?\n\nDon't take this to mean that you shouldn't do projects or something like that. \nMain point: Just make sure you set time for pes mandatory stuff and time for things that you are interested in and time to improve yourself career wise.\n                    └── Don't put yourself down so much man!\n\nMultiple more semesters are left, and there are so many different career paths you can take, just give it your best <3\n                        └── Thanks dude but I just wanna get placed and return the money to my parents :(\n                            └── You will, don't worry ❤️"
