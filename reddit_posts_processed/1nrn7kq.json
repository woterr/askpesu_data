      "body": "While I completely agree with having a speed limit that is enforced. Having a 15 kmph limit is just dumb. Atleast let it be 20 or 25. My bike goes faster than 15 when I'm coasting (throttle fully closed) in 2nd gear. Also, most vehicles, even those with reasonably shit brakes can stop from 20 in under 10 feet.\n\nTo add to this, while I agree that some dumbass students/parents drive recklessly, PES buses and trucks/Ace carrying construction materials or whatever drive wayyy faster than that, and almost all the dangerous situations I've encountered are caused by them rather than a student vehicle.\nâ””â”€â”€ Yeah they couldâ€™ve increased the limit 15 km/hr is very low"
