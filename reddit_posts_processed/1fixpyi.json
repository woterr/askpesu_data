It lets you access pesuacademy even without logging in but you need to be logged in to access anything else.\nâ””â”€â”€ > It lets you access pesuacademy even without logging in\n\nYes, that's the obvious behavior, becoz the web server ( pesuacademy ) is hosted somewhere in the campus, and that's reply back to your browser request.\n\n>but you need to be logged in to access anything else.\n\nYou need to login becoz it will create a session on firewall ( RN firewall is blocking user to go outside the internal network, if the session is created and once user entry is saved then firewall allow him/her to access internet and all the user activities are been logged by firewall )."
