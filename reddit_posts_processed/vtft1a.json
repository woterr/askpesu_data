Cause I find bitsat questions difficult to solve in a minute... If it's comedk/ cet level I might still have a chance... Did you give it this year? And how did your paper go?\n            └── Yeah this year, chem was good but not sure but maths went bad.\n                └── Any idea about marks verses rank? CSE ends at rank around 1200-1400 so idk how much marks are required\n                    └── Bruh thats why i am confused, result will come on 14 and \nI have manipal jaipur cse seat which i may lose because of it.\n                        └── So what's your plan then?... I messed up my comedk because I just shifted to Bangalore and in the process couldn't study... I think if you are confident that you'll atleast get 120-130 only then it's worth risking the manipal seat\n                            └── Dm"
