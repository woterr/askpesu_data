  "content": "I currently have a 74.3% attendance rate in one particular subject. I had sent in a letter explaining my absence and a medical certificate, but I was informed that attendance is not reimbursed and that the certificate essentially serves as \"evidence that I did not bunk\". My mentor told me that since it's above 73%, I should be alright, but I'm still not entirely sure.\n\nHas anyone else experienced a similar circumstance? Can I do anything else? Even with the medical certificate, my teacher refused to add attendance (I was really sick, bro ðŸ˜­). Will I still be permitted to write the ESA since there aren't any make-up classes this time? ",
