He used to randomly come to class and pull out people who did not groom well and people who do t have uniform.\n        ├── Our school was better lol\n        │   └── Dont worry, they won't beat you here lol, They man send you our, you can change the cloths or groom. Come and sit in next class.\n        ├── Nahh the uniforms looks so suffocating \nAll the other students have the freedom to wear whatever they wish to\n        └── Tyagi is still haunting us.\n            └── Lol"
