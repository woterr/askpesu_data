What if one doesn't have any other choice?\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ It's not bad, but I'm not sure if it's better than what BMSCE will offer. Besides, financially, BMS is the better option. I'm not sure if the 4.x LPA is worth the investment over what you'd pay at BMS\nâ””â”€â”€ saarr im not inclined towards ece I've been programming since i was a kid ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­I'm just dumb and not geting cse anywhere except dsce and srm. But I guess I'll go to bms ece now.\n    â””â”€â”€ Why not take CS then? Sacrificing branch for college is a bad option nearly always.\n        â””â”€â”€ well my parents don't want to send me to bad colleges ðŸ—¿\n\ni wanna do cse in srm but idk it's not in my hands :(\n            â””â”€â”€ Your branch choice now will also affect your prospective future higher education choices later. Branch stays forever - choose wisely now."
