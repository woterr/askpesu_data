Things have changed for good now. Back to 2 ISAs and ESA System per subject. Applies to both campuses.\n│       └── Could I DM you on some of my queries about the campus?\n│           └── Add 'em off here in the community. Help others make it through 🚣‍♀️🚣‍♀️😂\n├── Yea, exams wise it's quite the same. You get access to slides and materials on PESU Academy, the same thing for all. You'll end up using Vibha's notes anyway XD\n└── Yo!! Can I DM you?\n    └── Yea sure"
