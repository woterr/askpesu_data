I come from middle class family and 4 for ece and 3.6 for electrical is huge if ROI is not good otherwise i can pay the fee\n    â””â”€â”€ In general, the other non-CS branches here cannot keep up in terms of opportunities and placements at all. While the branches you mentioned might not be *bad* here (maybe someone else can confirm), they might not be worth the fees you'll end up paying. Join PES only if you don't have any other choice."
