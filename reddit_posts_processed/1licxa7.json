In NIRF ranking RV is at 99th number.\n    └── In NIRF , VIT VELLORE IS AT 10th or 12th and BITS PILANI at 28-29th and so see urself\n        └── nirf depends upon research papers produced i dont think so you should be considering nirf wise i might be wrong\n            └── It counts the \\*number\\* not \\*quality\\*. Big difference when colleges like PES, VIT etc churn out 100 papers per year.\n                └── Okay got it!"
