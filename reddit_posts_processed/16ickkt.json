But for an S u should listen in class.Electrical is the easiest subject in phy cycle, do all the class problems thoroughly along with assignment and question bank on pesuacademy, for mechanical there was a pdf consolidated notes of each chapter. Just mug that up. Mech isas can be really tough at times but u would surely cover up for it in the esa as it's quite easy. In 1st sem physics paper(esa) was very difficult so very few people scored 9.5+ in 1st sem. But in 2nd sem phy cycle, the paper was easier and quite a few people scored 9.5+ . For maths again solve classwork problems, assignment and question bank for s, python just keep practicing daily and refer to youtube .\n└── thanks!"
