But what are those companies which exclude *almost all*?\n    └── I do not remember anymore since being in CSE I don't usually look at the eligible branches much, but there are only like 1-3 companies that do so. You don't have to be worried if you are from ECE and you would like to sit with the CSE kids for placements. All T-1 companies and almost all other ones will allow CSE and ECE kids to sit for their tests, and sometimes the EEE students too.\n        └── Thanks again!"
