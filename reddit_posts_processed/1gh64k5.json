They will usually not ask anything that isn't in the slides.\n\nAnd please for the love of god don't forget to bubble the question number on top of each sheet. I didn't do this in my first ISA and lost marks.\n├── where do you practise problems from in math?\n│   └── Classwork and assignments.\n│       └── didnt get any assignments so far. only classwork. is that enough?\n│           └── I meant the assignments tab in pesuacademy\n└── hey what do you mean by bubbling the question number on top of each sheet? I dont get it\n    └── At the top of each answer sheet, there are circles to fill in for marking the question numbers. They'll brief you about these things before your exams.\n        └── okay, thank you"

In some hard subjects there'll be less than 10, for others it will be 100."
