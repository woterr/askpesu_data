      "body": "not sure abt the application acceptance, but kcet they wait maximum till 2nd round counselling and start all the classes, 3rd round kcet ppl had a lot of portions to cover later as they came 1 month late. A good rank in kcet should be 1000-2700 for CS CS-AIML branches at PES, cse id say maybe within 1600 ish, check out the cutoffs of 2024 for better info, For ece even ranks till 5600 was good as per 2024 data. ( im talking solely abt RR campus)\n└── ohk thankyou"
