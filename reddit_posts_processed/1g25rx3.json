Are both mrd(50%) and cnr(40%) only applied to tuition fees or the entirety of my fee paid. I'm in AIML and I paid 4.8L out of which 4.21L is tuition fee and remaining are other fees.\n\n2. They said smtg about paying 10k to register for the scholarships. Is that only for kcet students or for pessat too? (cuz sm PPL say it's not needed for pessat students)\n\n3. How is the scholarship processed. Does the money fall into the bank through which we paid the fees or is it smtg else?\n\n4. What were the previous year cutoffs for both scholarships and what should my realistic aim be to achieve them this year?",

They will give a Google form asking for your union Bank account details. Just fill that up and relax\n\n4.) Can't give any direct answer for this. When I was in first year, cutoff for 50% scholarship was 9.2."
