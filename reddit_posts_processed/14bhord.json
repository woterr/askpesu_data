Top rankers in PESSAT almost always do well in KCET/ComedK, and leave the seats for RV/BMS/MSRIT or even switch to a PES CET seat. Don't worry, the second round always has seats.\n├── I have 75xx rank. Any seat I can get tomorrow as per your view? Please help.\n└── Yeah something weird happened  \nLot of people from 900-1000 category did not come so I ended up getting the seat"
