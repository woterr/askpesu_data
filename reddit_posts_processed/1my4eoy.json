I just borrowed that book from the library and kept re-issuing it every 2 weeks. Saved like 800-1200 bucks (including student black market prices)\n└── wtf is student black market\n    └── Some guy stocked up like 9ish books and sold atleast 2 high prices cuz ppl were dumb enough to not check mrp\n        └── Just take it from library lmao or a pdf"
