Like I remember a question on UFS/NFS (idr exactly) came to draw the diagram of it and explain. In the slides there was only a diagram at 240p for it and no explanation for it given anywhere lmao. But they did ask that\n        ├── did they ask any coding, like for message sharing and file system system calls?\n        │   └── Yeah there were 2-3 questions coding related. Those are part of the 30% miscellaneous questions.\n        └── Are the slides enough or would we need to read the tb as well\n            └── I mean you can't read the tb at this point of time💀. Just do the slides properly."

Toughness depends on what kind of electives you take up. Only 1-3 of the core courses in 3rd year are challenging, they're more straightforward (but still vast)"
