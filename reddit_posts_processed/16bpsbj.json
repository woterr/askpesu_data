Avg placements are high for cs in pesu compared to bmsit\n└── As in pesu combined placement of both rr and ec happens so more avg placements but in bmsit only itself so it may be quite low \nBut in comparison with both  both are same level itself even bmsit have high package of 46lpa .\n    └── Do not see highest package, there might be only 3-4 people with such packages. Average and median is a good way to compare. Pes median > bmsit median. And same with average too. So definitely pes better. Not saying bmsit is bad, but comparatively pes better."
