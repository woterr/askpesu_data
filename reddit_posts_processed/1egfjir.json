However AIML goes on till 8 so if you are considering cse branches then  \n\n1. CS \n\n2. AIML\n\nThis would be perfect preference.\n\nOnce branch change is done, its final they wont allow you to go back to old branch.\n├── What will be the cse cutoff in ec campus?\n│   └── 7.5 last time\n└── Tq❤️"
