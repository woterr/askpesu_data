It's been posted there already\n└── Its not in detail its just the overview sir, I need in detail like chaps and all xan you provide????\n    ├── You will get to know more about chapters once it starts. The management keeps changing syllabus regularly so it's difficult to provide chapters as such\n    │   └── But any idea? Of all the chaps\n    └── For that as well, if you join the server and ask around you will be able to get the syllabus and see what all you have in first year. The reason I'm directing you towards joining is because it's all documented there\n        └── Sir I am in it, I asked many people but no one is giving, if you can provide would be very helpful either way if you don’t know I am even direct messaging and chatting with you😁😂in discord\n            └── Bruhhhh\n\nSomeone had posted the link to the \"PES Media\" discord server. Search in that channel you should get it, or ask again\n                ├── Which server is that? I dint find any link?\n                │   └── No need i found it\n                └── And why u ain’t replying on discord"
