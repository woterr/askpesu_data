I feel so hopeless about my cgpa. its really demotivating to study other subjects too whn your prev subjects dont go well i just feel so hopeless want someone to actually pull me out of this plsss\n    └── you wont know how bad it went until you get your results, most subjects might have relative grading and u would get better than how much you expecting so dont think ab it and study well for your next exam else you will regret not giving your everything.\n        └── Bro i swear i have written jackshit in the paper like filled it with bullshit it would be great if i get 15 😭\n            ├── That's good atleast u didn't leave it blank. Trust me I know people who have written the same answer for 4-5 questions and still ending up getting b grade in web technologies (3rd sem)\n            └── Us"

      "body": "It will. A backlog means you have an F grade, which corresponds to a 4 point. When you clear a backlog, that grade improves and thus the credit point associated with it also. \n\nNote - as far as I know, you cannot score higher than a C grade in a backlog exam. So the 4 point can only increase to a 7 point at most."
