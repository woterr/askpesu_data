Its easier for people to suggest.\n└── Elective 3- NLP, BlockChain, Digital twin, GenAI, Algo for info retrieval \nElective 4- DL, Robotics, HP, IS, DBT\n    └── Among E3, I remember Blockchain and AIR being easy with AIR being the easiest elective across 3rd year for my batch. Among E4, DBT is a mostly straightforward (and useful) course. Unless the syllabus has vastly changed, the first part of the course will cover most topics from DBMS.\n        └── I’d second this, I had taken AIR and DBT, both were pretty chill with easy assignments and projects"
