      "body": "near the hostel you'd be able to find a decent number of shops. as somebody else pointed out, there's one right outside the hostel and you'll be able to find many more within a walkable distance (i generally prefer the one that's located about 700-800 metres to the left of the hostel). grocery apps also generally deliver within ten minutes. near the college tho, there aren't many shops (since it's literally on a national highway), and you'd have to go into electronic city to find decent shops, so i would recommend buying everything you require around the hostel\n└── thank you!"
