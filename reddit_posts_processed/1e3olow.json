For me (in Delhi) it’s gonna be a 30k trip to even just go to submit the 10+2 marksheet (only document I didn’t submit original). Rest, in the acknowledgment, there’s some documents not ticked off but I’m sure I did submit them after the seat allotment in the documentation.\n\nThe main question, do I need to go submit the documents compulsorily or will it work if I do it when I go for orientation??",

The acknowledgement slip shows half the docs were collected even though I still possess all the originals.\nNo official communication from PES regarding this, and some peeps from my [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/s/XJyOGRXLbF) said that they discussed from seniors and recommended to hand them after start of semester."
