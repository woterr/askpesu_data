Idk about jss.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Alright man...which college have you decided to get into??\nâ””â”€â”€ There's no difference between the campuses\n    â”œâ”€â”€ I donno. From what I've heard PESU EC 's faculty isn't that great.\n    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ The faculty at both campuses are mediocre tbh. There is no discriminator.\n    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ ðŸ˜‚\n    â”œâ”€â”€ actually there are differences. i have heard there are better placements from rr campus and all the toppers chose rr campus during counselling\n    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Placements are common for both campuses, they do not check which campus you studied in.\n    â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Which campus has better professor's??\n    â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ It honestly depends. EC campus teachers can be quite strict, but they all teach from the same set of slides. I'd advise you to pick the campus that's closer to you.\n    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Please dont share half baked knowledge. Both campuses are the same - you can check the pinned FAQ post for more info. Recruiters don't even know which campus you are from.\n    â””â”€â”€ asli account se aao chancellor\n        â””â”€â”€ You can view my post/comment history to know that I'm a graduate :)\n            â”œâ”€â”€ All that help just to hear this lmao\n            â””â”€â”€ You are doing a great a lot of us appreciate you."
