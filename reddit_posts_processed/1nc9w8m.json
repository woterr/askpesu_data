      "body": "Start studying relevant sections from the textbook for DDCO. Solve the problems, as many as you can. The book is great; its pretty comprehensive and might be lengthy and tedious, but its quite good at breaking down the concept and explaining it in detail: something you are *really* going to need during the ESAs because surface level knowledge won't cut it. DDCO exams tend to be conceptually heavy, especially the ESAs where they tend to pick problems directly or adapted from the book sometimes. Most, if not all, have benefited from studying this course directly from the book.\n\n  \nWon't comment about DSA since I primarily depended on learning from the class and prof and just practiced online in my free time."

      "body": "DSA, if I recollect correctly, was mostly code. Both ESA and ISA had coding questions. Iâ€™d suggest picking a YouTube channel (like Striver, Abdul Bari, or Neetcode) and practicing on platforms such as HackerRank or LeetCode. Building intuition is really important for DSA.. if you practice well it would help with placements as well.\nâ””â”€â”€ oh thanks a lot! that is the reason im quite worried for dsa as well bc it's needed for placements but i find it hard to follow along in class."
