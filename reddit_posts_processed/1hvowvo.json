I didnt perform as expected in isa1 and I can see a similar trend in isa2 and mostly esa also. I can't bring myself to study rn coz it's just bothering me how I could've done better but still didn't. \n\nI am also in chem cycle which means I just let go of the most scoring sem of my college life and I just can't stop worrying. What do I do?",

Just pretend that all sems were hard anyway.\n\nTruth be told there is no \"easy sem\". It's all relative and if you study you will score. It's that simple\n\nJust because you lost some marks here and there, doesn't mean you throw all of it out the window"

That is true that 1st year is little easy because most of the topics are familiar.\nYes, you can study to improve your average GPA, but still unless there is some cut-off for placement of a specific company(like Wipro) or you are planning to study further, it's all fine.\nWork on your skills that will help you more to get the job not just the marks."
