So it got me wondering:\n\n* Is it smthg that will genuinely strengthen our resume, or its just smthg extra to mention?\n* Has anyone here ever got an internship or job because of their HackerRank profile?\n* Does being a 3-star or higher in a particular language really mean anything?\n* Which platform is more relevant to strengthen our resume?",

Get 5 stars and then a certificate.\nNot sure which platform is better."

      "body": "To answer all 4 questions in short:  Hackerrank contest , Hackerearth contest, leetcode contest doesnt matter. You can give whatever you like. The most important thing is be honest to yourself and try to improve your coding skills thats it.  I know people with 3/4 stars who cant solve one question without taking help or cheating because the just copy paste answers from internet/ChatGPT.  So yeah main goal should be to improve your DSA knowledge and problem solving skills here. \n\nYou can mention this in your resume as you are a fresher but that doesnt matter after some time, the thing that will matter is what you will learn doing this contest.  Give your 100% in all contest and never cheat better get 0 in this and try to score better in next contest. After the contest you can do analysis and practice the topics which you were not able to solve.\n\n  \nI have cracked 4 internships in top companies over my 3rd and 4th year of college. And yes my resume i didnt mention my leetcode or hackerrank profile but during interviews/OA i showed my DSA skills and was able to crack it. I think PES has taken a great initiative doing these contest please utilize it proper and dont cheat.\n\n  \nI think Geeksforgeeks and Leetcode are my favorite but i feel all are equal in this case. You can practice on leetcode everyday at home after college. I pretty sure if you start from 1st/2nd year its very easy to crack a 50-60 CTC package.\n\n  \nDoes being a 3-star or higher in a particular language really mean anything? - This is just bullshit timepass focus on problem solving and data structures also important algorithms.\n└── Thank you, this was really helpful.\n\n>  \nI pretty sure if you start from 1st/2nd year its very easy to crack a 50-60 CTC package.\n\nThere's a lot of grey area in that, but will surely try :)"
