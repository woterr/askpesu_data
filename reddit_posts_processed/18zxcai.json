Many companies have different gpa criteria and many shortlist later ( 9+ is always on the safer side). There will be many companies allowing 7/7.5+ students so don't worry much, focus on your 6th sem, projects, CP etc. \nHaving a good gpa is just Level 1, you need to still clear the coding test and technical interview rounds which is largely based on your core subject knowledge and CP, so keep grinding.\n    │   └── Haven’t practiced cp regularly till now. Is it too late? I am in 5 th sem\n    │       └── You still have time left, grind everyday. Remember quality over quantity.\n    └── Trust me good enough , 7.5 is minimum 8 is ideal but you’ll get enough chances for a tier 1 job, just concentrate on your skills"
