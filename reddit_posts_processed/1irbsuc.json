They won't be there after 3.30 tho, so go before that.\n\nWhen your ESAs are approaching, there is a backlog registration tab in your pesu web application menu. Go there and apply for the subject and pay for it and save that screenshot. Then go to COE to collect your hall ticket for your exam. \n\nThere is no separate timetable for backlog exams, they will be there along with the regular exams only , just a different date. \n\nBest of luck."
