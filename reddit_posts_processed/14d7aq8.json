I thought only the subs with labs are 5\n│   ├── As a general rule its basically weighted average of your grades with weights as the credits.\n\nS->10\n\nA->9 and so on\n│   └── Chem and CS are 5, EPD and math are 4 and mech is 3\n└── Thanks btw:)"

      "body": "So basically E is 5, D is 6, C is 7, B is 8 and A is 9, and S is 10. To calculate for a subject, what u need to do is multiply the marks with the grade and the number of credits and divide it by the total credits of the sem. So for a D in math, it'd be (6×4)/24 or 1. And for the C in C proh it'll be (7×4)/24. Do this for all the subjects and add them up for sgpa"
