Stop the fear-mongering, incidents happen everywhere and involve a lot of factors. What happened here can very well happen tomorrow (and does happen) at other colleges. PES has its flaws but it has consistently been one of the best options here in the city and state.\nâ””â”€â”€ Yeah, just because someone suicided, everyone should stay away and look for a suicide free college with shit reputation and 1 lakh cutoff\n    â””â”€â”€ Preach man"
