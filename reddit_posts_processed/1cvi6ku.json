It's not on campus so you'd have to take the college bus everyday. Haven't really heard anything good about the warden too so atb\n\nOh and the food is straight up ass afaik ðŸ’€\nâ””â”€â”€ ig its same for ec campus girls too? also 10 pm for boys wtf ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€\n    â””â”€â”€ Not really sure about ec but the first years both men and women stay in Amaatra (it's like 5 km from the campus ). Starting second year, the boys move to the hostel on campus and I assume the girls stay in amaatra till they graduate. As for the curfew timings being 10 for boys, it was 7:30 for us too but idk halfway through first year they extended it to 9 and eventually 10"

Boys have their hostel in campus but girls hostel isnâ€™t. But yeah thereâ€™s bus pickup and shi to pick you up and drop from hostel\nâ””â”€â”€ What about the food?ðŸ˜­\n    â””â”€â”€ You gotta wait for someone else to answer that, Iâ€™m not in touch w that friend anymore ðŸ’€ðŸ’€\n        â””â”€â”€ I see, thanks man\n            â””â”€â”€ Yup, got a friend who stays close to the hostel but not in the hostel, will ask her once just in case she knows\n                â””â”€â”€ Yeah lemme know if you find something\n                    â””â”€â”€ Yup, lmk if you want me to ask anything else. Unfortunately or not but got friends in cse, law , bba, design and psychology tooðŸ˜­\n                        â””â”€â”€ I needed to know if there's any scholarship for top rankers of pessat?\n                            â””â”€â”€ Apparently thereâ€™s no scholarships based on your rank, as in you wonâ€™t have a cheaper fees just because you got top 100 or smth, but yes if you are a top ranker in your batch during your course in the uni, you do get fees reduction. Criteria and all you can look it up itâ€™s there on their website. Theyâ€™ve named it after people so I donâ€™t remember lmao\n                                â””â”€â”€ Alright thank you"
