You'll find many who struggle to score a high GPA even after scoring well in CET. Usually, it's the people who work hard + are actually interested in their course who score that well, with the latter being the primary reason.\n        │   │   └── Yeah, interest is the major point.\n        │   └── No even pessat people do good. Also by that logic jee mains kids will do even better because their cutoffs are like 98%tile +\n        │       └── RIP PESSAT 2025\n        └── Wai 4.8 isn't fees like 1.5 per year (I am gonna join not sure yet I just saw a yr old circular here)\n            └── Not 1.5l 1.2l it is thru cet\n                ├── Damn nice ty for the info g\n                └── Also 1 more doubt \n\nHow much is the hostel fees"
