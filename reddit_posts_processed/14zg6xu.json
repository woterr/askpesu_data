Different case if it was through KCET.\n│   └── alright thanks\n└── If fees aren't an issue, pick PES since that's your best option. Although I'd argue that even if you're financially well off the money isn't worth it here and you'll have a comparable life via the other two options\n    └── thanks for the reply. yes but in rankings I always see people say pes>bms but since it was ec campus was not sure\n        ├── pes is above bms, placements-wise and maybe infra-wise too. It doesn't matter whether it's RR or EC campus. The same companies visit both the campuses.\n        └── It is better regardless of campus but you have a better college life in Bms as compared to pes’ hectic academics\n            └── What should I choose bmsce or msrit?"
