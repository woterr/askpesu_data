      "body": "Nope. This was only applicable during COVID when PES enforced offline exams but provided a margin of flexibility. This was rolled back in 2021 to the pre/post COVID policy which states that if you skip an ISA, it's a 0 for that ISA. If you skip ESA, it's a backlog.\n└── Oh alright thanks for clarifying !\n    └── just curious about what option you chose lol\n        └── Students reacted against offline ESA during COVID. Scroll back to posts and comments from 2020-2021, you will see multiple rants. We even posted on subs like r/bangalore for attention. Nothing happened. \n\nTo answer your question, I stay in Bangalore. So I chose the ideal situation of giving ISA 1 + ISA 2 + ESA since it decreased the risk of screwing up a single component. Most people preferred the ideal situation, followed by skipping ISA 1."

      "body": "No. If u miss an ISA you need to write to the COE or VC or Pro chancellor to request for higher weightage for the next ISA. If you miss both u will need to request for ESA having full weightage. Afaik the first case has been granted to some people, but I do not know about the latter."

      "body": "One of my friends last sem couldn't attend an ISA because the traffic was so bad from the place he was coming from, even though he left at 8 or something (exam was at 10:30), he couldn't even reach metro. He asked the HOD as to what to do, and they told him he'll only be evaluated accordingly. Look, I don't know what's your case to actually miss an exam, but make sure you have a good one. Oh, and being sick is not going to work as an excuse lol"
