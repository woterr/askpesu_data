An easy way to search for clubs is to search for their Instagram pages. Maybe google \"dance club PESU EC campus\" or something similar.\n        â””â”€â”€ alrightt thanks\n            â””â”€â”€ They've updated the website with the clubs from back when I was there, not bad: [https://clubs.pes.edu/campus/pesu-ec-campus/](https://clubs.pes.edu/campus/pesu-ec-campus/)"
