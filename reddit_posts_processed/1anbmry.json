I personally found the first couple of units to be tough while the other three were very easy.   \nTo the best of my knowledge, the slides and notes were sufficient for this subject. If you're not able to understand something you can always just go and ask your teacher or look up some yt channels like neso academy.\n└── Glad to hear that it gets easier.Thank you!"
