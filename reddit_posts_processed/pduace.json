You can find the details in their website. \nwww.pes.edu/intake-of-courses/ \n\nCheck that link\n└── Ah okay I had misunderstood the allotment.\nWait then I'm assuming anyone under 700 rank in pessat will be eligible for cse at rr campus...in the subsequent rounds that is if a percentage of people  under 280 ranks will get admitted through the kcet quota or will opt for some other college through mains or advanced..right?\n\nRealistically what are my chances at cse rr campus with 680 rank?\n    └── At 680 rank you should get CSE at RR Campus. Previously, PESSAT ranks for CSE have closed around 850-900 (the 2018 batch was a different case, don't use the numbers from that year)"
