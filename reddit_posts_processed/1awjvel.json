I am not sure of the amount though. In my batch, people who left before 4 years were charged x% of their fees.\n└── Hey can you please reply in dm."

Your health and well-being should be your top priority. I think they take a percentage of your fees if you leave while a semester is going on. Just talk to your HoD once and get everything clarified"
