      "body": "I'd say you can , paper was indeed a little tough\n\nIn 2022 someone got 274 and 76 and got a 15k rank.\nSo you can expect 9k-11k. \nBest of luck man and prepare for comedk now\n├── Ah I see thanks!\n├── what about 135 marks and 288 in boards? any hope for below 1k rank? just want pes cs any round is fine.\n│   ├── You fuckers should stop making me feel bad about my grades 💀💀💀💀 last tear that would have fetched an 800 rank that's like cs in first round bruh 💀💀\n\nPs: did you prep for jee?\n│   │   ├── sorry :C. But yea i prepared for jee. Dont feel bad because of me, i gave my all in for jee for two years to fuck that up severely.\n│   │   │   └── Ah man dw I'm just kidding. Really proud of you man , you did amazing 🤌🤌\n│   │   │       └── Thanks man, that means a lot.\n│   │   └── is it actually?? cause even i got sameish and thought i was fucked since in boards i got 285\n│   │       └── It really depends on how tough paper was this year and the competition. \nImo competition never increases a lot in kcet and the paper was tough so the ranking *may* see a huge shift.\nBut no one can really say. This is why no one dares to make videos on this topic until results.\n│   ├── Bro wtf you got 99%tile in mains? I'd heavily suggest not to come here man , NIT would be a much better choice right 💀?\n│   │   └── yea but no cs. Even with home quota only eee\n│   │       └── eee is prolly good though one of my neighbours did ece in nit suratkal and her internship itself was in Japan and she got starting salary of 30 lpa. but you could go to dehli University too!!\nbut jee is such a fucked exam so much competition 🥲\n│   │           └── Might bro, but I'm honestly just tired of studying subjects I don't like, I'll probably end up taking cs in a tier 3 college rather than eee/ece in tier one. I'll try to get rv through comedk otherwise pes itself is the best option I'll get\n│   │               └── yeahh i get that I'll get mech in nit suratkal and i could never study that stuff lmao even i am hoping for comedk rank, hopefully we both ace it 💜\n│   │                   └── Yess bro, send update when it's done paper phod ke ayenge 💪💪\n│   │                       └── heyyyy how was it????? i got 2xx rank!!!! wbu\n│   │                           └── 3xx rank lol, congrats man\n│   │                               └── niceeeee!!!!congrats!!!!! maybe we'll see each other in rv haha\n│   │                                   └── Haha, how was comedk\n│   │                                       └── ohh i got 2xx rank in comedk too\nin pessat and comedk i got, i was talking about comedk haha not pessat now\n\ncause beforeeeee we had been talking about comedk\n│   │                                           └── Ohhh right mbmb, yea pakka we'll meet in rv then 💪🏻💪🏻\n│   ├── If the paper was really that tough this year then you can even *hope* for below 500 and try for RV information science or AIML till 2nd round\n│   │   └── Rv keliye properly comedk try karunga. But atleast pes with low fee for now i need to guarentee\n│   │       └── You'll 100% get PES CS (PES also has jee mains quota btw check it out). So stop worrying about it 👍\n│   │           └── Yea but jee mains quota fee is some 4-5 lakhs, can't afford that much sadly 😔. But I'll give comedk now and try my best to get rv there\n│   └── so what rank did u get??? im writing my cet next year and my aim is within 5k what are the approx marks im supposed to get?\n└── Bro i got 275 in board and 77 in kcet"
