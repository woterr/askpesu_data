The only drawback in pesu is that there is a lot of academic pressure. Also it's a school like environment. Ig placements wise it's same as srm as pesu also has increased many seats this year. And also I have heard (not sure tho) that in ec campus there is little bit of a gunda type crowd who don't want to study and all.\n                └── pesu's tuition is 20 lakhs\\*\n                    └── Yeah I included the mess and hostel"
