I was planning on getting an internship in different city and I don’t plan on coming back. I heard if our paper gets published we have to come for the presentation but is there anyway i can ditch that and just take an A grade rather S since you get an A anyway?",

      "body": "You mostly won't need to show up at college unless there is some unseen event. Either way, do give your capstone presentation in person. Why throw away an easy S grade?\n└── Well the way i see it, A or S won’t matter to me much. It’s 2 credits and no-one even asks for my 8th sem transcripts\n    └── I am not sure how things are now, but the default capstone grade isn't an A for not publishing. Its a C. So you might want to check that again. And you do need your transcripts (official/unofficial) - every company requires that from graduates when they join as full time employees. At the end of the day its up to you, but I don't understand why would one be adamant on not returning to college for official matters."
