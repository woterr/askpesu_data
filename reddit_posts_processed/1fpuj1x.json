Like on what basis are you even judging these both clgs?\n                    └── \"Competition\"\n                        └── You didn't even take the admission bro, you don't even know how people here are, how can you even talk about competition.. More than 25 percent people weren't even eligible for placements and 10 percent of the people go to higher studies.. You are just competing with 65 percent people for placements.. i,e 2160*0.65 = 1404 and assuming 1200 jobs is what pes cse got this year if this would be the same In the next four years the placement percentage would be 85 percent.. I don't think you should expect more than this from a Pvt clg.. So plz stfu and don't consider competition ffs\n                            └── Lmao u look unemployed sorry 😭 I just said \" competition\" u should have understood I meant \nPes has extreme competition where as msrit don't \n( More chances to get placed in higher tiers as the competition is less ) \n\nGo get some job done now 💀\n                                └── >Lmao u look unemployed sorry \n\nYeah I'm lol, don't have a job rn lmao coz I literally am a student\n\n>More chances to get placed in higher tiers as the competition is less\n\n?? So if there's a clg having 100 kids and getting 50 job opportunities is equal to a clg having 1000 kids and getting 500 jobs? Which has more opportunities kid the 50 job offers wala clg or 500 offers wala clg?\n                                    └── \nU should be studying rn rather than wasting time on me if u care more about job opportunities 😭 \n\nGo study ! 💀\n                                        └── Thank you for the care brother, plz don't mislead students from the next time.. Hope you get ec campus cse in the next round.. ☺\n                                            ├── Yupp I'm actually saving them 💀\n                                            └── Ifykyk why I asked him to choose msrit 👽"
