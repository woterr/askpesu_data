You can join in online and still block your seat if you are from another state and cannot attend the counselling.\n        └── nope, just checked the website. there's no online counseling, it's clearly mentioned\n            └── Oh my bad, I assumed they would continue with the procedure they had the last year for us.\n                └── maybe cuz of covid\n                    └── Probably, but doesn't make sense as yhe counselling was in late August 2022"
