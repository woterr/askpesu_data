  "content": "I am realising how shitty the problem statement is, \nthe guide didn't mention about how she feels. or questioned it purpose of doing in the beginning \n\nsomehow with a very uncoordinated team, I am now, without having a proper clarity on my own problem statement.\n\nBut she the guide wants us to keep going when I had asked her about not having an idea and in a very big dilemma, She just said do the lit survey you'll get an idea\n\nIn the review today, they, the panel reviewers said the same. that there's no clarity with what we want to do, they even cut off the lit survey we were presenting\n\n\n\nif I talk to the guide after the 5th sem normal ESA, is there any hope that they'll allow us to change the problem statement \n",
