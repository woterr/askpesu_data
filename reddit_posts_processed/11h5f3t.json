So if you're in first year you've missed the chance already, and it's doubtful to return anytime soon. Secondly, if at all it happens, all the prep takes place usually in the summer, which you guys don't have (late semester and ESA lolz). So basically TAS isn't happening anytime soon. Maybe 2024 if all things go well.\n\nSource: Was part of the core team that last organised TAS in August 2019. Good times :\")"
