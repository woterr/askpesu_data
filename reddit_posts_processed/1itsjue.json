If they don't you'll just have to attend the \"extra classes\" in the esa study break.\nAlso, apparently there's a \"cet pass\" for the cet kids when it comes to these matters. The word is that management doesn't care that much about the attendance of kcet students. If they find out that these students have low attendance, they just make them sit them in some form of detention for a few hours( you can basically do anything, which is still adhering to the college rules, in that time)"
