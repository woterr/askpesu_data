  "content": "Not a student but a concerned parent here,\n\nI have heard that some subjects like DDCO are very vast and difficult to cover in sem3\n\nMy son was born 3 hours ago and i plan on enrolling him into PESU for CSE-AIML,\n\nIf he starts preparing for DDCO and AFLL from next week onwards, will he be able to complete everything before sem3 ESA? would relaxing a week hurt his odds of scoring well? or should he start working tomorrow itself\n\nany help is much appriciated, thanks 🙏",
