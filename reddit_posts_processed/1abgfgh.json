Thing like total credits required for graduation (CSE)\n2. Total Special topic credits\n3. Total internship credits\n4. Credits required other than the core subjects \n\nThanks a lot.",

      "body": "So you need 160 credits to get your degree. 132 credits worth of subjects, 22 per sem until 6th sem. Capstone is 10 credits. Your special topics is 8 credits. Internship is 6 credits. The remaining 4 credits will be online classes during 7th sem.\n├── Adding to this - if you can't secure an internship, you'll need to take up additional special topics to cover up the 6 credits. Special topics are 2 credits each, so you'll need to take up 3 courses to meet the degree requirement.\n└── So are we required to do the 8 credit special topics within the duration of first 6 sems or can we do it later too ?\n    └── You have until 8th sem. But you might become busy later on with projects and internships so it's preferable to do it within 6.\n        └── Hey I am in 6th sem, I have only 4 summer topic credits, when can I earn the other 4?? Like I have a on campus summer internship. So during the 7th sem can I earn the other 4?? Or what options I have?? \n            └── You can do it 7, no problem."
