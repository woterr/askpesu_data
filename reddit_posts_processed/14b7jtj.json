      "body": "Can't speak for other colleges but PESU currently follows a 5 internals(MCQ) + 1 End Sem(fully written) pattern. The 5 internals (which are rumoured to be reduced to 3 from the new sem) account for 50% of sem marks and the ONE fully pen and paper end sem is the other 50%. So we're not devoid of written tests. I hope that helps \nGood luck.\n└── note that all the exams that you give in PESU , be it internals or ESA's are all CBT's (computer based tests) , meaning you need to sit and give it on the computer . For the esa you have the liberty of choosing whether to manually write it on paper or on the computer , but for ISA you have to compulsorily do it on the computer and ony a scribbling sheet (rough sheet) is provided for calculations .\n\nAlso the roumour about shifting to the 3 isa system is true . It was confirmed a few days ago by our C professor that the university is shifting back to the 3 isa format ."
