The current first years are the only ones on campus, so they might be willing to help out. \n\nAlso, as far as I'm aware, PES won't let you transfer in at the beginning of 2nd year since they don't have a credit transfer system. But I could be wrong.\n├── A lot of colleges don't have credit transfer system but when I approached them they were open for transfer if they had vacancy and the syllabus matches.\n\nMoreover I tried joining the discord server but it needed some authentication from pesacademy\n│   └── You're talking about other colleges. I'm talking about PES. You can still join the server and post on Ask a Senior.\n│       └── Yea I get it but I'm just gonna try\n└── There are summer internships going on some senior are here too\n    └── Do u have contacts of any of the seniors?\n        └── They keep us bifercated so no but you could try"
