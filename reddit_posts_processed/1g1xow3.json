  "content": "I had gotten a rank of 14k in kcet and chose CSBS in BMSIT but over the past few couple days I've been pondering if I made the wrong choice and should have chosen biotech in PES instead. \n\nDid I make the right choice by taking CSE in a lower tier college or should I have taken Biotech in PES and applied for a branch change next year for CSE in EC campus whose CGPA cutoffs are quite low?

Validation from a bunch of redditors isn't gonna help you in any real way. Accept what you have and grind well :)\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Good response üëèüëç"
