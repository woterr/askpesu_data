No math in 3rd sem?!\n    └── Statistics is math based, somehow you wouldn't expect linear algebra in 4th sem to be simpler in terms of the math difficulty compared to statistics in 3rd sem but it is.\n        └── Oh yeah, after one whole year of calculus, I’ve lost touch on other parts of math. Linear Algebra is simpler than statistics? Damn, but it’s believable. I have seen some weird stuff in the statistics part in 11th and 12th grade."
