      "body": "Firstly, what most students loosely term relative grading isn't actually relative. PES reduces the cutoffs for each grade so more students get a higher grade. That's why everyone gets a grade boost, something that wouldn't have happened in *true* relative grading. You can read more details on this in the FAQs. \n\nNobody knows how they determine how to change the mapping between marks and grade because it's not deterministic. And ofc, PES isn't transparent with any of these details either. Just assume the pass mark also drops by 5-10 marks from the original.\n└── I swear I remember them saying at my start of sem 3 \"meet\" in auditorium that they reduce the cut-off by however much the topper misses 100. Like if topper gets 94, S grade cut-off drops to 84 and so on."

      "body": "Relative grading for a batch is determined by the performance of that batch and not on the basis that the previous batches had relative grading in the subject.\nAs a general rule of thumb you can expect relative grading to be done for a subject if everyone in your batch underperforms."
