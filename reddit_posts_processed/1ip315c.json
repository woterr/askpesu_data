I'm a final year student so luckily I don't have to go to college much anymore, so I've been the happiest I've been in a good while. \nThat place and the crowd there just drains everything our of you. I hate the stupid rules they've put in place too, and don't even get me started with the god awful professors. \nJust do your work, study decently, and get out asap.\nâ””â”€â”€ what rules ?"

I'm not very academically gifted either and have to work my ass day and night to get even a decent gpa. I've accepted that this is what it's like, and there's no point whining. I'm sort of relieved knowing I'm already halfway there and after a bit more struggling I'll be out of here. I really hope I'll feel happier after I graduate lmao."

      "body": "I felt the exact same way when I joined this college. The teaching made no sense, didn't like the crowd here and definitely hated how every semester was an experiment for them to try something new on us. Going to and returning from college felt like a chore everyday. I couldn't wait to get out of this place.\n\nFour years later, I found a few friends who I've become incredibly close to, funnily enough we got close by hating on PES and its policies lol, I realized that Professors were victims of the system as much as we are and every batch is going to be a guinea pig for something, looking back I'm happy I didn't have to do those stupid subject hackathons and fruit problems(seriously, what the fuck are those?). \n\nWhat I'm saying is that this college isn't great. Now that I'm no longer actively going to college, I've been feeling much happier. But maybe you need to a change in mindset too. Unfortunately, you need to attend college because they have an attendance policy. If you fill your head with negative thoughts, you just feel worse. Just attend your classes, stay out of drama, get a good GPA(8.5+) where college doesn't see your academic scores as concerning and you'll be out sooner than you think.\nâ””â”€â”€ Wdym by going to college felt like chore bro??? Ain't it a chore???ðŸ’€"
