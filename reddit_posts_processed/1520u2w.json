By the time I reached there, he had jumped. \nThey left him alone after detaining for MPC.  No one was with him. The counselor just walked away.

Kid will be out there alone under pressure & will be torched as usual by School authorities as always.. he would be threatened to ruin his future.. it‚Äôs always been like this. Kid bringing phone by mistake in hall & using it are two different things. End of the night .. what were school authorities doing till parents arrived. Kid was still in there premises. Now school will destroy all evidenced that parents or any one can get there hands on to clear there name & continue there cruel business as usual. Life of anyone‚Äôs child does not matter to this abusive authorities. There should be protest against this. Why the kid was not escorted to hospital & was left in premises to die. So many suicide cases are happening because of schools & facilities carelessness .. why this is tolerated & accepted like nothing ever happed & life goes on .. one after another child‚Äôs life is taken away each year by this system. Speak Up & Protest .. it could be your child next. Have never heard in 50 years that any high society or powerful persons child have ever committed suicide  because they are given separate rooms to sit & cheat as this facilities run by favoritism & donations. \n\nCommon Community need‚Äôs support of parents, children‚Äôs, lawyers, news writers & Ethical teachers & facilities have to protest against & protect our kids. \n\nGrow up.. Wake-up.. if u have seen something then say it .. & Gather the strength to help parents. They need help üôèüèº\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ https://youtu.be/FdQ8lAx75YE"

Who even ends their life for getting caught in an exam. I've taken my phone once by mistake too. When I remembered, I called and told the invigilator I have it by mistake. He just told me to keep it in my bag. Also your child is a nobody, no faculty is interested in harassing a student. I'm sorry but you have to accept your child was weak and you shouldn't be blaming the university.\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ You can't blame the parents on this\nBeing registered for MPC puts a black mark on your profile when it comes to placements and scholarships\nHis parents raised him to be a better person\nAnd you never know how he was feeling at the moment\nbeing an honest person and being accused of something like this does scare a person\nHe probably had a weak moment\nThe management is to blame in this, they are very careless and harsh. Quick to come to conclusions without hearing the full story, merciless is the word.\nThe parents would have anyday preferred having a son with a malpractice case to a son who is dead and the parents have absolutely no part to take blame\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ get a fucking grip over yourself my dude\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Bro just shut the fuck up. Don't even bother to come out of whichever hole you're hiding yourself in.

You think professors will believe your shit and ask you to keep it in your bag?! They'll take it away and won't give it to you until you and ur parents beg them to give it back. Show some sympathy you motherfucker.\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Weak? Man you must be dumb to think that ending your life is a decision a weak person makes. It is vulnerable situation, yes. But to dismiss him as a weak person is so fucking tone deaf. Have some fucking empathy man, damn. You're addressing this god awful message to a person that claims to be the victim's mother.\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ The person who can write such shit to a grieving parent is a \"parenting error\", period. \nSorry , but please go home today and ask your parents where they went wrong and why they did not teach you basic human decency. Once done, go take a walk.\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ I don't know if u r from this college or what, and if u were what kind of a delusion u r living in... Such an incident has happened last year too, a friend of mine was given a backlog in the subject along with mpc case filed. Before blaming the parent of an innocent kid do think once.\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ I think you are the reason behind his death üò≥\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ This is probably a management account but yeah if you're a management account, I hope all of you motherfuckers get lined up and shot. You literally sell the college for something it isn't. If mediocrity had a fucking mascot it would be PES. I honestly would've regretted the entire experience if it weren't for the people. I hope all of you face the consequences for this absolutely disgusting immoral act.\nI thought initially that maybe the guy was soft. But talking to other students and the account of his OWN MOTHER, I realized that it's you fuckers who have to be thrown off the building.\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss Ma'am. I sincerely hope it gets better for you.\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ My condolences to you. I cannot even begin to imagine your pain ma'am. For 19 years you had raised him with all of your love and adoration. Sent him to a reputable institute with all your dreams of sending him for his first job, seeing him get married and much more.\n\nI really wish you all the strength that God can give you. I hope that you know that even in heaven Aditya loves you and will always will. If you ever need anything from us students ever, you can reach out to us anytime. \n\nWe will try our best to be of any help.\n\nRest in peace Adithya üôè.

NSUI National Coordinator\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Aditya Prabhu was a perfectionist , he was one of the brightest students of us all . To have known him for almost 3 years , he wasn‚Äôt someone who‚Äôd give up . he was organized focused and level headed . we strongly believe that the management has been careless about how they‚Äôve approached the whole situation . Mentally abusing a student , telling him that his life isn‚Äôt worth living and leaving him unattended cannot be accepted . So much could‚Äôve changed if the counselor was responsible enough to guide  him . In a generation where everyone is trying to pay attention to one‚Äôs mental health , how could the management of a prestigious college be so irresponsible? we strongly believe that the right guidance could‚Äôve saved his life . He deserved better and his family deserves better .\n#justiceforadityaprabhu\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ According to me, the idea was to not get caught until he got caught. \n\n\nIt happened to me too, I told them within the first 10 minutes that I had mistakenly carried the phone and everyone was chill.... I am a 2023 graduate btw. \n\nTeachers kind of know about students they teach. They have a very good idea about who all can, and who all cannot cheat in exams. Teachers are not dumbazz-es. I wasn't harassed even once in my career. Probably teachers just do that to tough peeps. \n\nIt's parents' fault. They should teach their kids that the other name of life is problems. If you can't face problems, then you have no reason to live. \nEg- Tomorrow, if you don't get a job for say 6 months, should you die?? No, right!! You have to keep fighting with life's problems. \n\nIk, I am gonna get a lot of down votes here."
