  "content": "Are there places in Bengaluru where we could get good quality products (clothes, footwear, bags etc.), basically hostel/college items at cheap rates? If so, can you guys please suggest a few places for the same, preferably ones closer to the RR Campus. I am not from Karnataka and am confused whether I should buy these items from my place and then take it there or to buy everything from Bengaluru. Which would be a better option? ",
