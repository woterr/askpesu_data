An auto would probably be a bit faster.\n    └── If you take bmtc, it is 5 mins. If you walk it can take anywhere from 10-15 mins\n        └── Haa thank you so much 🙏🙏🙏\n            └── I am new to Bangalore. I will be staying with my cousin in Whitefield and planning to take metro from there to Mysore road.\n\nCan you tell me   \na) Name of the BMTC bus stop near Mysore road metro station  \nb) Name of the BMTC stop near PES University  \nc) Couple of BMTC routes that goes to and fro from Mysore road metro station and PES University  \nd) How much is the fare?"
