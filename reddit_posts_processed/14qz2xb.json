      "body": "No. If you don't get pes in cet take bms or msrit in cet, it's obviously much better than coming here via pessat.\n└── Rather than BMS/MSRIT, I'm thinking of CSE (Data Science) at RV through CET....But thanks a lot for your feedback\n    └── Yeah that would also be good, don't go for pessat when you're cet rank is so good. Some people with cse in rr campus through pessat have 10k+ ranks in cet, you shouldn't be paying the same as them.\n        └── Yep, I know. All my friends who messed Mains and got 2k+ ranks in CET are the only ones going through PESSAT.\n\nThe only reason I considered PESSAT was because of the 50% scholarships they give. In my parents' eyes, 9 lakh for PES is definitely worth it if I get the scholarship\n            └── No offence but I think your parents have been brainwashed by all the advertising. A lot of us were.\n                └── None taken lmfao, all their opinions of PES are based on the advertising"

      "body": "Absolutely not. You have a great CET rank, I'd suggest picking BMS, MSRIT CS or even IS/IT (now sure what it's called) at RV. Nothing justifies the exorbitant fees here. Please do go through the pinned FAQs post on this subreddit along with the pros and cons post that was posted on this forum.\n└── Will go through the FAQs, my bad for not reading them before posting\n\nI'm leaning towards RV CS(specialization), or even PES AIML over BMS/MSRIT cause I've heard conflicting opinions about both those colleges. Thanks a lor for your feedback though\n    ├── IMO specialisations aren't a good choice. It's bad to restrict yourself at this stage. But if you absolutely do want one, please choose RV. PESU is currently in no state to be picked.\n    │   └── Will keep that in mind.\n\nDo specializations restrict you that much? I always thought it was 80-90% same as CSE, and only a little of the specialization\n    │       └── Yup they do. There have been multiple comments on this sub (a lot by me lol) that explain it in detail. Please do go through. If you're in CS you can *choose* to specialise in any field. Don't let your branch take that choice away from you.\n    │           └── Aight, thanks a lot for the detailed feedback. My bad for picking your brain, but i really don't want to waste my parents' money without putting proper thought into my choices.\n    │               └── No worries, I understand. Feel free to DM me if you have specific queries. You can also join the PESU Discord server and ask other current students. Good luck!\n    │                   └── Sure, thanks a lot\n    └── Where did you hear the reviews about BMS and Ramaiah cuz I've never seen any till date\n        └── From seniors who've graduated 2-3 years ago. They weren't CSE students tho, so maybe the CSE department is good in those colleges\n            ├── Aight 👍\n            └── 2nd semester B.Tech CSE(CY) undergraduate at MSRIT here.   \nCSE and CSE(CY) or any other CSE(spz.) for that matter share common syllabus till the end of 2nd year. After that, you'll be restricted from choosing spz. electives if you choose any of the CSE(spz.) degrees. Other than that, placement-wise, no info yet. This is due to the fact that none of the batches with that degree finished their placement-phase. In general, VTU affiliated colleges are a bit slow. We're in the 2nd semester (about 3 more months left) while PESU would be starting their 3rd soon. College doesn't have red flags as such as of now. Management is pretty great, very organized. But it definitely isn't stress free. 7-8 subjects in the first 2 semesters with 2 internal tests and frequent quiz for internal-internal component. PESU used to have 5 ISAs but I heard that it's now reduced to 3. So stress / pressure wise, it isn't that chill here. I was in PESU for about 1.5 months before I got allotted CSE(CY) in MSRIT  in the 3rd round of KCET.   \nAll the best for your counselling!\n                ├── did PESU refund PESSAT fee?\n                │   └── 2022:\n10K rs. non-refundable and it was 2K rs. per class. The rest of the money was refunded. PESU has a great refund system, they're very flexible and cooperative.\n                │       ├── Oh this is very good... In counselling and on their website they said that beyond the last date notified by them on website, they will not refund\n                │       │   └── Could've been an updated policy then.\nWhatever I've mentioned, it's based on my experience in 2022.\n                │       └── Will they refund even in case of ComedK seat secured in 2nd or 3rd Round. I guess not...\n                │           └── Last year, they refunded literally every single student. Those who shifted to BITS/colleges through COMEDK or KCET etc. Not sure if it's the same this year though. Call them up 🧜‍♂️\n                │               └── Thanks\n                │                   └── You're welcome!\n                └── heyy I'm in EXACTLY the same situation as you... looking at last year's cutoffs I'll definitely get MSRIT CSE spec or slightly better (maybe a lot better- fingers crossed cause of seat increase)... I've already booked a PES core CSE seat via PESSAT, as someone who's been in both institutes, what are the differences you noticed? Which college is better in an academic sense, extracurriculars/ enjoyable college life, placements, better chances of going abroad?\nalso, could I please dm you? thanks:)\n                    └── A lot of people would call me out for being bias towards PESU, but trust me, I just talk about stuff from placement perspectives and that's mostly why PESU stands out. But if you're looking for those extra factors like campus life, going abroad for masters etc. then MSRIT has an upper hand. However, this reply overall seems very vague. So sure, you can DM me :)"

PES is also convenient for me cause travel is easy and i know a lot of people."
