  "content": "Yep, you heard that right, all systems went blank during today's ESA and we had to wait for around an hour to get the hardcopy of question paper, during that time, I lost my momentum and you can say kind of fell of the track, Still managed to complete the paper. I wanna know if there is some way we can report this to COE and try to get some grace marks?",

I knew it was a bad idea to ask this..\nâ””â”€â”€ Did the answers you wrote in the system before they crashed get erased or were they saved?\n    â””â”€â”€ No idea, I knew that there was technical issues since past 3 days, thats why I avoided typing my answers\n        â””â”€â”€ Same here didn't even touch the keyboard except for entering SRN"

If it was for all students they won't even consider giving grace marks\nâ”œâ”€â”€ It happened for everyone\nâ”œâ”€â”€ for everyone\nâ””â”€â”€ Even if it happened for only one person don't expect grace marks. As long as they gave you back the time lost, its fair enough in their eyes\n    â””â”€â”€ They did give us extra time, we got 45 mins extraðŸ™ƒ"
