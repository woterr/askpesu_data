Lab marks everyone usually gets full so you can nullify that, just focus on your isa/esa/assignment\nâ”œâ”€â”€ My seniors said that they don't release previous year esa questions so I'd like to know how hard is it to get 85+/100 in esa actually? How much can someone who scored above 25 in the isas score in the esa?\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ that depends on your esa prep I've seen people with like 8/40 or 12/40 in ISAs pull a C or even B grade in a subject, so just do your best, aim for full, don't think about 85+/100 bec pes always have a weird relative grading\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Isn't B grade 70?\nâ””â”€â”€ Are the corrections for the assignment(open book test) strict or will they give 9+ to everyone?"

Did you try that?\nâ””â”€â”€ Yeah I tried to add a row but then i realised they never explained how the grading for constitution worked like there's no assignment for it so idk what to enter in the assignment marks columnðŸ«¤ and also the chemistry score is out of 120 which is reduced to 100.\n    â””â”€â”€ If there's no assignment, it's 0. \n\nI believe all scores are first scaled down and then added, instead of first adding and then scaling. That's what we used to do anyway."
