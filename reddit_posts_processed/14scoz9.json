So, you can keep using your PRN, but afaik they will also give you the password as per recent changes.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ And how's the speed?\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 30-50Mbps\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Speed is pretty fast. But it does block several sites \\[including unexpected ones xD \\]\nâ””â”€â”€ Lan Port???\n    â””â”€â”€ Do we have to bring a lan port with us or wireless internet will be provided?\n        â”œâ”€â”€ Same question mate\n        â””â”€â”€ Wireless network is provided"

      "body": "Wifi ranging between 30 to 50 Mbps can easily be accessed , however the number of sites that you access are limited . Like you cannot access any website which is even slightly inclined towards gaming , like even those sites which show sports news . Streaming of matches , YouTube can be done with ease without a problem . So overall yeah college wifi is good .\nâ””â”€â”€ Okay, thanks"
