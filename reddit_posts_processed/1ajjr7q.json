  "content": "I just checked my ESA papers today by paying 100 rs each (sem 1). How does the revaluation process work? If I put my paper for revaluation by paying 1000 rs, does the whole paper get rechecked or do I have to select certain Qs which I want them to re-evaluate? Also can marks reduce during reval?",
