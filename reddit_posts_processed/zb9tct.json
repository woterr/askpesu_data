The registration page is only if you want to withdraw or drop courses. If you had visited the registration page, you would have noticed that the status for each course would have mentioned \"Enrolled\" by default.\n\nSo even if you don't register, it'll assume you are going to sit for all exams. Regardless, remember to always verify everytime."
