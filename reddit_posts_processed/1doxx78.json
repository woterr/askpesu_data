  "content": "BITSAT 224 , will mostly get Msc Physics/Chem/Math in Hyderabad/Goa and maybe MSc Maths in Pilani as well.\n\nGetting PES RR CSE with Pessat.\n\nI want to know what option would be better in the long run ( placement focused ) . I'm very passionate about CSE and I've done courses and have certifications in Python ( ML related libraries like Pandas, numpy,scikit,tf,etc) and 2 other languages so I'm inclined towards PES but BITS is also a complete different league and has its tag. Altho my parents ( and me too ) feel like Dual Degree would be risky because my branch will be based on my first year cgpa...",

      "body": "Though possible it's highly unlikely that you'll get a computers degree at bits. Most likely you'll end up with a lower circuital, or even mech or lower if you underperform.\n\nI was in the same dilemma as you two years ago, and I chose pes. It turns out i would've easily got EEE at Goa in the next round but I pulled out of the allotment so i didn't get it\n\nI really regretted it at the time but it's honestly a blessing for someone like me. Pes is a breeze compared to my friends's experiences at bits who are struggling with sub 7 gpas. Easy 9 gpas without studying more than a week. It's not like I mug up or anything, the courses are just simply easy. \n\nSo you get a lot of free time to do other stuff without really compromising your college courses. \n\nI'm not saying it's better or anything like that but im just saying that sometimes it might be better to be at the top of a lower college than at the bottom of a higher one. \n\nBut since you're not even getting a 4 year degree, i personally think the risk and the high competition in first year makes bits a worse decision. \n\nAlso since you say you're interested in computers from the start, i think it's probably the better choice"

      "body": "There are already good answers here. If you want an objective answer: BITS has a far better reputation. The opportunities you will get there are unmatched. You will also have a much better college life and will also have access to significantly better placements (because you say your focus is placements). If you want to set yourself up such that you have the best chances of landing a very high-paying job, choose BITS. Companies in India also pay T1 students more money than T2/3 students for the same entry-level roles, so even if your peers get placed at Company X from PES, you will end up earning 1.5-2x at least.\n\nHowever, as others have said, you will probably not get CS. You will have to sacrifice your interests and push yourself to study courses like bio/chem while also taking out time for CS on the side. It is possible, but everyone knows that BITS is tough with most students scoring in the sub-7 GPA range. But more importantly than that, you will never get to actually study a program you want to. To me at least, the course is more important than the college and pursuing your interests is very important. The branch sticks with you forever. With hard work, you can cover the distance between a T1 and T2/3 college. I got into a top US university for MSCS where > 95% of the cohort comprises IIT/BITS students. It wasn't easy at all but its definitely possible. A better college will provide you with more opportunities but at a lower ranked one, you will have to create them. \n\nTo summarise, you will have to see which is more important to you. If all you care about is getting the best package and are ok with sacrificing your interests, then BITS. Otherwise, you might be better off at PES."

Why are you commenting about placements if you aren't even in the college dude?\n\nPES has always had great placements. Every year *most* people get placed, with multiple students at top companies including Apple, Microsoft and Amazon to name a few. Even this year, given the recession, PES has done significantly better compared to other colleges in the state. \n\nThe stats are all public - go find them [in this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/1ct5ujc/comment/l49p42j/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). You will find links to placements over the last 3 cycles. And companies not visiting PES because of the suicides? Check the same link. You will see that all the major companies have visited despite that. \n\nDo your research before commenting.\n├── PES has one of the best placement records for cse , I don't know what ur talking about 😂😂\n\n\n\nThe suicides are also new and the last suicide apart from the recent ones was in 2012 , and this is not a factor to any companies looking to recruit from a college.\n└── Wait are companies blacklisting pes cuz of the suicides? This is the first im hearing of this, from what i got to know from dads colleagues and moms friends is that a lot of companies visit pes\n\nRegarding the bits thing, it is very well reputed but OP is only gonna get msc chem most prob, which means insecurity regarding BE branch and having to study chemistry fir 2 years\n    └── It's all over the internet tho\n        └── And are you dumb enough to listen to random YouTubers who weren't in PES or the batch of students who recently graduated and know which companies visited?\n            └── Dude I just shared what I heard , never asked anyone to believe what I say!
