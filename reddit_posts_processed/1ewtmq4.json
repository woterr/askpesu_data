      "body": "if placements don't matter then I would maybe say RVU, like I get that PESU is more established but RVU just has a better curriculum that would equip you better for masters, and if your only goal is higher studies then what you study in bachelors matters the most, not to mention, again, if placements are not a concern then PESU is just not that much better to pay five times the fees when compared to RVU\n└── agreed but the problem is my parents want me to continue in pes(through pessat)\n\nand i have a friend getting bms cse through kcet but willing to join pes cse through pessat\n\nbut btw thanks for the suggestion. which yr are u in ?"
