      "body": "The medium of instruction will be mentioned on your transcript. You can get a provisional transcript if you haven't graduated yet by requesting one on PESU Academy (if I remember correctly)\n├── Oh thank you for replying!\n└── You apply for the transcript on pesuacademy and then submit the payment receipt at the COE office which is in the basement of BE block. They should have it ready in 2-3 days.\n    └── To apply, I have to generate a new ticket on student grievance redressal system?\n        └── It's under Online Payments -> Miscellaneous Fees. The category is Exam Certificates and Transcript is available as a sub-category. This is on the website, I'm not sure if it works correctly on the app."
