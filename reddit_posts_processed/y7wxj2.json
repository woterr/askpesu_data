      "body": "It all depends on what you want to pursue. Personally I'd always pick branch > college but seeing that it is BITS a  lot of people like you might think otherwise. \n\nAlso if you do happen to stay in PES, my suggestion is to stick with CSE and don't take up AIML.\n└── Your flair says you're a graduate. If you don't mind me asking, what was your package? Maybe an approx figure?\n    ├── Yaar ye sb nhi pucha krte\n    └── Not revealing exact figure, but it's 16-20 LPA\n        └── That's great, but the average package in bits (all branches included) is 22LPA and for cse alone the average is almost as much as the highest package in pes💀 the average in pes with all branches included is 7 LPA. The above mentioned info is from the placement in charges in both the pes campuses, I've visited them both before I got accepted in bits. I've been to both pes and bits and I'm sorry but these 2 colleges are incomparable unless OP has a huge financial problem\n            ├── nah bits goa all branch median was 18, plus you're spending an extra year with dual and uncertain branch, so I wouldn't really say taking bits is a no brainer.\n            │   └── Pilani's median is 22, not that there's a huge difference between 22 and 19 anyway. Most people don't care about the extra year, and majority of the dualites get an electrical branch atleast. If you aren't even sure about being in the top 70%, then maybe you shouldn't come to bits 🤷🏻‍♂️ pes cs is the low risk decent reward option for you.\n            │       └── i'm in bits goa ece right now, they showed median to be 18L all branches during orientation , the extra year is 6L+ which is not really a small amount plus your 3rd year is going to be really hectic, if OP's main aim is to get good job BITS would be better but if he's really interested in cs it would be hard to manage cs if he doesnt land cs after 1st year considering he's already a dualite.\n            │           └── I'm talking about bits pilani, pilani campus. The median is 22. You're right about goa though. The MSc courses are mostly manageable unless it's math. Most dualites end up getting high IT packages irrespective of their BE branch so it's not a herculean task.\n            │               └── Are you a fresher?\n            │                   └── Yes, but I have relatives and friends who've been to bits and they've all told me the same thing. Placement stats were shown in the orientation\n            ├── I agree with all your points. I don't deny that BITS in terms of placements will be much better. \n\nI would still choose CSE in PES over any non-CSE branch in BITS because at the end of the day that is what I want to pursue and have always been interested in, ever since I picked up how to code way back when I was 11 years old. For me the branch/course is more important than the college, as long as it's not a significant sacrifice being made. I can say that I created my own opportunities and have achieved a great deal already in the field I am interested in, and would not have been able to do the same if I had sacrificed my passion, and am doing decently well in my career as well. \n\nThat being said, I understand that for some people the college is more important than the course for various reasons (which again, also make sense to various degrees), but at the end of the day it all goes down to what OP prioritises more - branch or college. This is something OP themself needs to figure out, we can only give our opinions once they've made that choice.\n            │   ├── Very Well Written. Thanks.\n            │   └── You're right, at the end of the day it comes down to OP's preferences. But imo the majority of the people who choose cs are just after the package and they could do that easily in a much better college.\n            └── Averages are the worst way to check for placement stats...\n\nYou'll always have really big packages and really small packages, what you get is not the middle\n                └── Exactly💀 so wouldn't the case in pes be so much more worse, according to your logic?\n                    └── Nope \n\nThere are a lot of people from PES who get decent packages from placements, like a real good amount\n\nSo yeah, factually correct :')\n                        └── I know they do. But the people who get worse packages do also exist, and their condition should be much worse compared to a bitsian who gets a \"bad\" package\n                            └── Nope, this entire BITS has gone into your head\n\nThere are so many people who get below average packages in BITS (I sadly know them)\n\nSo yeah, there are both good goods and bad bads in both of the colleges\n                                └── You're right, but the people who get below average packages in pes are obviously more than the people who get below average packages in bits right? That's what my point is"

My teacher was interested in Electronics but admitted to Bits Goa Msc Chem, now he is a lecturer. He always regrets his decision.

He might have to study some branch he might not necessarily love, but in the end he gets the bits tag+stellar placements+infinitely more exposure. Please stop misleading people to feel better about your choices. Bits is the obvious choice here\n└── Pilani campus had a placement of 20lpa median and 21 ave, for all branches combined. He is going to be okay at Pilani lol."

I suggest you join bits cuz you will have more time compared to pes students, no attendance rule will give you some peace, and you have 5 years... You can take up more projects and learn more. And if you get CS in your BE then you're golden bud.\n└── And honestly compare the difference in competition of getting in 2 lakh people give bitsat and few thousand get in whereas 20k give pessat also management"

Its 5 year course.The good part was cut off to opt for CSE  was around 8.5 for his branch unlike other core branches where cut off was close to 10. So next year he got into CSE with 8.6 cgpa.He just have to study one extra year thats it.\n└── While I agree it turned out well for your friend, it might not be the same for OP. Better to give an answer that focuses more on what is definitely possible instead of speculating on possibilities."

Now CSE PES is really good and renowned. I don't know why would you want to do MSc if you are interested in the tech field\n    └── You're absolutely right but it's not just an msc, perhaps OP should've made it more clear. If it was just an MSc, I would agree with you. OP is talking about the dual degree program at bits, so basically everyone taking an MSc is allotted a BE based on their cgpa at the end of their first year, and majority of the dualites atleast get electrical branches. So if OP decently studies during his first year, he can get CSE as his other degree (along with the MSc). So unless OP has a huge financial problem, bits is the obvious choice because a cse/ece/eee/eni degree from bits >>>>>>>>>>>> pes cs. Even if it comes to the worst case and he ends up getting mech/chemical as his second degree, he can go for high paying finance options which are available pretty much only to the top iits and bits. Everyone who takes an MSc is allotted a BE in their second year btw."
