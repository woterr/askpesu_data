They can only ensure that people with CGPA < cutoff don't sit for the test.\n\nOr did they do something new this time? xD\n└── They said in some orientation that the cutoff for tier 1 is 8.75\n    └── There's no cutoff, it's a trend, they said that they've noticed a trend of Tier 1 companies hiring students with 8.75+"

      "body": "There's no cut offs for a specific tier. It entirely depends on the company and what they specify as eligibility criteria. But the trend is such that you're better off with 7.5 - 8+, for higher chances of making the shortlists.\n└── Oh okk so if i maintain a gpa of around 8 while mainly focussing on coding and develoment...i should be good enuf for tier 1?"
