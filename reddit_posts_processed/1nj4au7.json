This is so fucked man.i guess i should have studied more and practiced how to get lucky these years.",

I used what i studied like 5% through the entire process.it doesn't really matter at this point.but I do suggest start from 1st year and hope that you will get lucky.maybe the process wouldn't be so fucked up for you maybe only the deserving ones get selected so start preparing from now I don't think dsa shit will make sense in another 4 years"

      "body": "I know it seems bleak, but its still pretty early in the placement process. We had T1 companies visiting even in the even semester. Just keep practicing and working hard. Eventually it will work out for you, the same way it has worked out for your seniors. As I said in another older comment, placements is a marathon. You cannot give up in the middle, you need to keep going until you reach the finish line. Some people start closer to the finish line and win early, some take more time. You cannot control how the companies will shortlist, but you can control how well you stand among your peers. Crying over what you should have done is futile, instead focus on what you can do starting from today to improve your odds.\nâ””â”€â”€ What do you mean keep working hard \nI did practice leetcode but fucked leetcode easy ,\n\nSo please define working hard\n    â””â”€â”€ If you worked hard but are still struggling with solving easy questions, it means you aren't working smart enough. It does not matter if you put in 100x more effort than the other guy if your approach is incorrect. Some advice in life: when you see yourself putting in efforts but not seeing results, its often best to sit down and introspect. You need to figure out why you aren't doing well. Sometimes, you need to switch your strategy, sometimes you need to test yourself more in challenging environements, sometimes, you need to put in more work. So if you see yourself struggling with leetcode easy, make a list of all the problems you failed to solve, find a pattern, see what type of questions you are struggling with and work on it. Blindly putting effort without a plan is as good as not putting in effort."

So even if it feels annoying not getting shorlisted, stay patient and keep putting in the work. \n\nThereâ€™s no point about being sad that u didnâ€™t grind enough now in the past, donâ€™t waste that time/energy thinking about all that; there are more imp things to pay attention to now in the present.   \n\nAlso thereâ€™s no downside of being optimistic rn, only real downside is slipping into pessimism , so might as well chose to be an optimist and keep grinding :) \n\nGood luck and get itðŸ’ª"
