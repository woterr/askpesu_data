Atleast one day will end before lunch  \nand yes free time exists, albeit it also depends on your commute time\n\navoid repeative questions marks & capitalisation tho. makes you sound like a kid\n├── Thank you for the information nd I'll surely avoid questions marks nd capitalisation 🙏\n│   └── Aside from that, everybody has two half days in a week where classes end at 1 or 1:45 depending on the shift. One of the half days is Wednesday but the other one varies from class to class\n└── What’s wrong with sounding like a kid 🤡"

Timings are from 8 45 - 145 on half days , and uptil 445/4 depending on if u have phy/chem lab or c lab.Timings are not bad if ur a hostelite or stay close to campus , but its really soul draining if you live far (like me)\n├── Hey, are you from rr campus or ecity? Could you tell me if I should take cse aiml in rr or cse in ecity campus thru pessat? Both are at the same distance for me\n│   └── apparently aiml course so far has been the exact same as cse , thats what the seniors have been saying , placements are combined anyways but the peer here in rr is better. 1 thing tho if you want to pursue higher studies its apparently better to do cse core than aiml(idk why dont ask me im still 1st year)\n│       └── Do they disclose which campus you belong to while sitting for placement?\n│           └── no\n└── ec campus has one/two half days and all full days, you guys in rr are so lucky 😭"

      "body": "How much of daily grind is required to complete projects/assignments. I plan to commute for an hour one way daily. Wondering if I should pick the hostel or not?\n├── Most of the assignments can be easily completed using ChatGPT, and even if there are assignments that cannot be completed by ChatGPT, only one person in the class does it and circulates it to the entire class.\n│   └── You honestly should not be encouraging this. Using ChatGPT/someone else for assignments does not help anyone lol, you are the one that misses out on learning the thing.\n│       └── I am not encouraging it, I am stating the truth, all my classmates use ChatGPT, whether you like it or not. He has a right to know the answer for his question.\n│           └── Yes, he does. However, he did not ask if one could use ChatGPT/other ways to finish the assignments quickly. He asked about the difficulty of the assignments/projects and how much time it would probably take, which you did not address in your answer. The answer to \"How much time does X take\" is not \"You can also do it using Y, it is much faster\".\n\nFirst answer their question, then add your suggestions at the end.\n│               └── Were you a part of DEBSOC?\n│                   └── Nope, why? xD\n│                       └── Because I felt you were trying your best to win the debate there. Btw I have no idea why we are both getting downvoted.\n├── I know a lot of toppers who commute for longer, you’ll be fine\n└── 1 hour is pretty standard travel time. A lot of people spend more time travelling one way. Its not as much of a grind as it seems, it largely depends on the course but I would say most of it is manageable. A few courses have no assignments while a few are heavy."
