If you get lower than 6 in 1st sem you won't be able to bring it above 8+ in a single sem.\n└── Adding to this, you can refer to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/yup6ok/with_5_isas_whats_the_formula_for_calculating_cgpa/iwatrw9) to calculate your SGPA and CGPA and see for yourself how much is exactly needed"
