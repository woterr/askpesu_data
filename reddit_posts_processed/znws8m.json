      "body": "Electrical - easily the easiest 4 credit course. It's only ckt analysis, with minimum formulas. Do Krithika slides and PESU academy, if u want more practice do textbook. 5th unit, actually we had a study material and everything came from that only (check if it's same with you peeps). Esa, 96/100 marks will be derivations+numericals even in ISA very less theory is asked  \n\n\nPhysics - Do Notes and Faisal sir's slides. It's a confusing subject, practice well and at least try to understand. First two units are very tough, but the next 3 not that tough, do well in the last 3 ISA if suppose you messed up to first or second ISA  \n\n\nI hope these tips might help you\n├── Which study material did you use for the 5th unit in electrical?\nAnd where do you get the Kritika slides??\n│   └── By study material,   \nI assume for ESA and ISA,   \nFor ISA / ESA both I did textbook - Hughes, and also some problems from assignments & QB from PESU-academy  \nand Kritika mam slides, you need to search\n│       └── Do you have any link for those slides ??\n│           └── Nope, I do not have it now\n└── Yass! Kruthika ma'am supremacy!"
