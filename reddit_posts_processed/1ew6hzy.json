Write a letter the chancellor stating that you are surrendering the pessat seat and converting to kcet.\n└── previous documents? i have submitted 10th marks card,transfer certificate,12th marks card and stuff already to pes   \nis there any other documents required\n    └── Then it's fine, just go with the acknowledgement (the admission order) and the other stuff as mentioned\n        └── Okie thanks"
