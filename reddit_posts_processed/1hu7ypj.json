Do I need to submit a medical certificate or talk to her once again in person?\n(Teacher - Shivsankari)\n",

So maybe if u butter her enough maybe she'll change it.\n    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Thanks for the info\n    â””â”€â”€ The number of courses with less attendance does not matter since attendance is computed independently for each course. Reach out to your prof as someone else suggested and see if they can show a bit of leniency."
