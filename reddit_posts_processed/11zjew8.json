My advisor only seems to care about marks, so I was curious if others r like that as well, especially in the case of higher sems as they will be needing help for internships, placements, higher studies,etc.\n    â”œâ”€â”€ Good for you that they care at least that much, mine doesn't even remember us.\n    â””â”€â”€ Almost everyone's faculty advisor is non-existent, so I guess you at least have something\n        â””â”€â”€ Oops forgot - ours asked us to give feedback about college after we graduated and called us a bunch of times at work for the same reason\n            â””â”€â”€ Wait, for real? \nOMG. Is the NAAC survey not enough for College review? ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚"
