If you don't get one by late April/late May then don't expect to get one.\n└── In 3rd sem rn. Can you tell if I can grt any summer internship in summer 2024 through PES and if yes, how?\n    └── I don't remember if PES offers any opportunities for 3rd/4th semester students. However there might be a few things you can do **AT** PES in that summer. \n\nI'd recommend either speaking to your mentor, HOD or your favourite teacher about this. They will know best.\n        └── I don’t live in bangalore, so I was thinking of doing something at PES for half of summer and other half was planning to go home. Can you tell some activities that students normally do for summer\n            └── Go speak to your mentor, HOD or your favourite teacher about this. They are the ones who will know. \n\n\nOtherwise wait until one of your peers reply. I do not know what a second year student can do."
