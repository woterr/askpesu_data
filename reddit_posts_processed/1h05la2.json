      "body": "Is that convocation fee fair enough? Need clarification.\n├── First of all asking us to pay for convocation is not fair\n│   └── Yeah exactly my point. Even if we buy the convocation gown and other items, they just have to organise the dinner and the auditorium on their expenses.\n│       ├── And why can't they, atleast for the graduating class ? What do they do with the big bucks they get from mqt ? \n│       │   └── they are building medical college in hosur road   \nWE HAVE TO HELP THEM\n│       │       └── Not even on their expense, real the annual report of Krishna institute of medical sciences, they are sponsoring most of the work these Bros just gave land and stole the name, it's not even their infra\n│       └── Yes exactly 🥹\n├── This is the first time they have a fee. They never charged anything before this. \n\nCharging people to give them their degree is fucking wild. So glad I'm out of here.\n│   ├── I would rather just collect the degree, take a few pics with friends and professors and move out lol. Ungrateful college it is.\n│   ├── Reminds me of DU , they didn't have convocation, u just went, submitted some info and got your degree certificate and it was done lol. \n│   ├── Then y only our batch !!!\n│   │   └── You're a special batch ✨\n│   └── Honestly just gonna collect the degree some other day and move on 🤡 they ain't getting my 2k\n├── Maybe it's to control the huge number of people who would turn up. They can just have convocation in parts instead of having everything in the same day. Let Cs ppl have it on one day, other departments on another, bba on another, etc. Plus guess they've run out of good guests to invite and may need the bucks to get someone decent. They wanna cut costs by asking us for money. \n│   ├── Asking us money for our graduation is not correct :(\n│   └── Exactlyy, and idek if the gowns will be for us to keep :(\n└── There shouldn't be a fee for convo. Its our degree...that we slogged for 4 years. Taking the fees should be enough to cover but no\n    └── I agree with you, I feel disgusted looking at their atrocities."
