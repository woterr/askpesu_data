      "body": "Atp, its almost gone only. But IBM has this thing where your offer depends on the panel u appeared in. Cuz each panel is one project and these ppl first need the budget allocation from the company for their team and project. So only after that is given they'll take in the students. So far the 2 sets are 2 panels is what I've heard. And the rest are on waitlist till company gives clearance on budget"
