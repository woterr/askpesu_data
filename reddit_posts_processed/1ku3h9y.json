Mail them or have to go in person\n    â””â”€â”€ In person is best imo, mails is fyn too I believe.   \nI'd try mailing first then if they don't reply for a week or 2 just go in person one day inform them and come back\n        â””â”€â”€ Aight thanks\n            â””â”€â”€ But beleive me the teachers don't answer ur mailsðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­"

Most mentors on't respond to emails fast and you could easily get delayed and stuck and frustrated. It's important to be in touch with your mentor at all times. Paper will also need to be published."
