      "body": "Question (and you can choose not to answer): \n\nWhy leave after 2nd year? After the 1st year is understandable because of numerous reasons. But after 2nd year you're done with half of your degree. I'd say practically you're done with *more* than half of your degree since the only actual \"year\" left is 3rd year. 4th year is capstone, placements/internship and Masters admission prep with no offline classes. College is practically over after 6th semester, the final year, although very important to your career, is almost a formality when it comes to college related stuff. Surely, it must be easier to just stay for 2 more years, right? Especially given that PES doesn't transfer credit. \n\nI'm pretty sure you have a reason but I'd like to hear it if you don't mind sharing.\n├── I'm planning on taking the LEEE exam of IIITH so if in case I get selected I can continue my further education there...\n│   └── lateral entry?\n└── Do we have to pay full fees for 4th year ?"

So bro if I’m from management and I want to leave then I’ll have to pay for all 4 years?? Please let me know, and how credible is it??"
