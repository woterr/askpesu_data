      "body": "Anything with paneer is decent . Amaatra and ec campus food is same. But u get 2 choices at ec campus for mess, vakula and food court, food court is better imo. Sunday dinner food is also good , with chicken and veg biryani and some paneer dish with veg burger and ice cream too at times\nâ””â”€â”€ Thank you !\n    â””â”€â”€ Beware of the gobhi Manchurian though !\n        â””â”€â”€ Why.. What's wrong with these two?.. Wor..??\n            â””â”€â”€ They are the worst dishes u can get in food court and many   people order from outside when these are made\n                â””â”€â”€ Like taste is bad or unhygienic with worms as these two veggies are peculiar for that\n                    â””â”€â”€ No dw u won't get worms anol in ur food (atleast we haven't experienced anything till now in 2 years) just the taste is bad\n                        â””â”€â”€ Oh okay.. Then atleast it is least bad.. In some Pgs heard some horror stories about food.\n                            â””â”€â”€ Yeah but u expect a certain level of hygiene and more too if u are paying that much fees for pes hostels"
