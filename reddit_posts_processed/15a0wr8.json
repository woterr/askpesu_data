Regardless of the offers you have received to date you can apply to these companies. The other details were not in the orientation but i think you can get an idea from [these spreadsheets](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/xyl4cs/placement_stats_for_2023_batch_ongoing/)\n└── 60??? are u fuking sure?\n    ├── Yes\n    └── Yes 60+ is dream tier. 12-60 is tier 1."
