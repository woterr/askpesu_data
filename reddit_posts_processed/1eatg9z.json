I hope u got cs at least\n└── pretty much every place raised the fees, its not that bad honestly.  5 is for cse itself. ece is a bit less.\n\nlots of mfs paying more then this for vit.\n    └── 20 Lakh for PES is still too crazy lol. We paid 3.5 and still think it's high because this is supposed to be a merit seat lol. You get a good rank in PESSAT and still need to ay 20 lakh huh lmao\n        └── seats still sold like hot cakes lol, they wont reduce if ppl still take them."
