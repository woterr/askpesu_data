  "content": "What start date should i enter for 6th month internship?? I am guessing its may end or June start , after 6th sem ESA. And one more doubt , So imagine i get this internship, its on site and i have to go there everyday. So my doubt was can we do this?? like miss whole 7th sem?? Do we have classes in 7th sem?? And can we do an intership during this period.  or internships are not allowed during this time and i should skip it and try for 3 month internship instead ?? \n\nThanks a lot ",
