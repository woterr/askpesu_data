I almost have a panic attack.\n    â””â”€â”€ Well, I am also like u, I barely have any friends even after JEE or before JEE, not even one from my school days, as people say, you have ur best time in school, but this is not correct in case of mine.\n\nJust take a deep breath man and don't think about the consequences of talking to other people, like \"what will other people think about me\" and all like that and u will be doing good."
