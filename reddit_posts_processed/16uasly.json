U would need the originals and 2 sets of self-attested copies (signed by you) of them.\n├── Should we get the notary from gazetted officers.\n│   └── Nope. Ntg as such is needed\n└── Should I just sign it and write \"true copy\" or is there anything more to it.\n    ├── I didn't write anything tho. I took 1 set of originals, and 2 sets of photocopies. And signed on the photocopies and gave them.\n    └── Nope , my advice take 3 copies of all originals since they'll take only originals + 2 sets self attested copies and you can keep one set to yourself just incase you ever need them...\n        └── Should you submit your original school and PUC markseet?\n            └── Yes"
