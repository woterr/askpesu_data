Doesn't really matter. Some photocopies had no attestation. In those scenarios I had to self-attest.\n\n•  Take atleast 5 passport and 5 stamp size pics for admission. I almost f'ed up that part.\n\n•  About the anti-ragging affidavit, nothing was asked.\n        └── 10th and 12 th marks card \n\nIncome certificate\n\nRural study certificate\n\nHall ticket kcet\n\nLeaving certificate\n\nStamp size and passport size photo \n\n2 sets of photo copies \nAm I missing something other than challan and admission order?\n            └── 10th and 12th marks card take originals and photocopies.\n\n2 copies of admission order (idk why but i luckily had 2)\n\nAnd yeah I think this will be enough.\n\nAll the best for a great life in PES University!\n                └── Thanks for helping."
