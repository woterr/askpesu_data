Everyone else was sitting for placements when the time came.\n\nAll the same companies came again, donâ€™t worry about it. Start prepping DSA now so you can ace them once internship+full time placements begin\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Could i DM you? If you don't mind\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Sure. Feel free\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Now it's a blood bath for internship, I remember last year we got asked Partition DP stuff so many times in OAs\nâ””â”€â”€ Now the situation is crazy; Hardly 1-2% get internships on campus and most of them won't even get converted also"
