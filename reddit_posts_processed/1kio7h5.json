You can't get a C grade and expect your GPA to go up lol.\n├── But they don’t add the credits till 8th sem right??\n│   └── Yup, all internship and summer course credits reflect only in your final semester.\n└── Unrelated to the topic but I've read in another comment of yours that you interned from CCBD, what is the lowest possible grades that are given here?\n    └── Theoretically, any letter grade from S to F. However, I haven't heard of anyone getting lower than an A from their internship."
