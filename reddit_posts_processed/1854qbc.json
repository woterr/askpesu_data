      "body": "I graduated a while ago so I could be wrong but basically:\n\nIf you withdraw a course, you will need to clear it to be eligible to graduate. It is not considered a backlog. The course ESA can either be taken up in the summer or when the course is next offered (usually the same time, next year). Until you clear that course, your transcript will show a 'W' grade/letter for that course. If I am not wrong, withdrawn courses have to be taken up, contrary to dropped courses, which you can skip out altogether. \n\nNote - you cannot drop mandatory courses, but withdrawal is possible.\n└── Would that also mean that I won't get my report card physically after this sem ends since one of the courses is still not cleared ? (not that I need it anytime soon ). Thanks for the help !!"
