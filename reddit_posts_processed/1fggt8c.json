Last year's, placement stats do support this.\n\nAs a current fourth year, I get a mail almost every other day from pesu placements, with mostly tier one companies.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ W pesu.. \n\nThis was actually an appreciation post.. The title looks like it's some defamation post or something xd\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Also most of my friends with less than 8.5 cgpa got placed with more than 12 lpa jobs\nâ””â”€â”€ How's the placement policy there ? If we get a job above 15lpa will they allow to sit for better opportunities?\n    â”œâ”€â”€ No, if u get a tier 1 job, then that's it, you're out of placements..\n    â””â”€â”€ No, if u get a tier 1 job, then that's it, you're out of placements..\n        â””â”€â”€ *Except for dream companies\n            â””â”€â”€ Ohh dream tier is altogether a different tier? I thought it comes under tier 1 itself..\n                â””â”€â”€ It's above T1"

I remember seeing last year's placements stats in orientation last month, in that the category with >8.75gpa had some 70 odd unplaced studentsðŸ’€\nâ””â”€â”€ Idk if it's true or not, but i remember him saying that almost 25 percent of the students go for higher studies right after their bachelor's.. And pes doesn't even maintain the data of registered students , pes only shows the total number of eligible students and placed..\n    â””â”€â”€ Yeah that's true. I think in my mind I assumed those guys went unplaced at that timeðŸ’€"
