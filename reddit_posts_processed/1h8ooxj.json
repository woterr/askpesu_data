Exams are decent, half the class got A or S last time, A is fairly easy but S is hard. Assignments are hard but you will learn something from doing it and will enjoy them(If you have taken BD, it is similar difficulty to them but it I found HP assignments to be better than BD assignments)."

      "body": "TDL is known to be pretty heavy and depending on who takes it, can be a hit or a miss (mostly a miss at PESU). DBT is mostly straightforward but also very industry relevant and in general a great course, similar to BD. Someone already posted about HP.\n├── Is bd a prerequisite for dbt ?\n│   ├── Nope. No electives at PES have strict prereq requirements.\n│   └── No, from what I’ve heard there’s actually quite a bit of overlap between BD and second half of DBT. So you don’t need to do BD but if you did then it will be repeat of some stuff.\n│       └── Which one is more scoring , info sec or dbt ?\n├── Thank you so much!\n└── Are the projects/assignments for DBT as hard as they were for BD?"
