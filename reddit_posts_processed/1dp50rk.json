Unless you submit for re-eval and your grade changes, your provisional results will become your final results. So don't expect them to change unless you make a re-eval request.\n\nAlso what happened a few weeks ago was an exception. Grades do not usually bump up like that.\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ Damn. \nBro I was expecting S in physics they straight up gave me a BðŸ¥²ðŸ’€ðŸ’€\n Hopefully I get something after reval\nâ”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ Hope for the best, prepare for the worst\nâ”‚           â””â”€â”€ Imagine me getting above 30 in both isas and 8 in assignment and got B in esa ðŸ˜­\nâ””â”€â”€ why tf they want their students to get less cgpa? its not even affiliated to VTU\n    â”œâ”€â”€ cuz they want us to suffer\n    â””â”€â”€ They prob like the thought \"gpa in pes >>> same gpa in other units\""
