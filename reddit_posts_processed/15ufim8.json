So CS in ECC should be better then AIML in RR imo (unless you have a problem with the location)\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Bro My rank is 4k can I get ec campus aiml \nFirst round cutoff is 3.5k for aiml\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Might get, just attend counselling and hope for the best\nâ””â”€â”€ Yea location is a bit messy ngl. Too far and dad ain't gon give me vehicle so bus... thanks anyways"

CS at ECC is a much better option\nâ”œâ”€â”€ tbf I do have friends who want RR only because the EC location is really inconvenient, not because they think it's lesser than RR in any way.\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Yea exactly\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Location is a huge factor bro\nâ””â”€â”€ I don't get it Aiml is just a specialization right? In computer science engineering then why is everyone so against it?\n    â”œâ”€â”€ There's a long explanation posted on this subreddit by me. You can check the FAQ post, it links to it.\n    â””â”€â”€ [For reference](https://reddit.com/r/PESU/s/HPRAFQdOP6)\n        â””â”€â”€ Thanks for the info . So RR aiml is worse than EC cse core ? My rank is 1700 so what should i be going for in the 2nd round?\n            â””â”€â”€ Yes. I'd suggest if you want CS, try getting core CS at RR or EC. Pick AIML only if you don't get either of the two"
