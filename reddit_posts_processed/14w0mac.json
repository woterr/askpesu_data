      "body": "You could keep rv ece and eee above colleges like cmrit, niite menakshi,jss etc if you’re not inclined towards cs only\nCause rv ece and eee are wayy better than the colleges above mentioned\n└── Ya but I don't have much idea about ece(i do have some idea) like do companies accept ece students for placements and will i have to do coding completely on my own If i take it. I'm bit inclined towards cse too.\n    ├── Thanks btw will think on it!\n    ├── yeah most cs companies do let ece students to sit too and yeah you gotta learn coding on the sides (either ways you have to cause the faculty is kinda trash in most colleges even for cs)\nBut yeah cs is easier and you get more time to code but I would suggest pick ece only if you have interest in it\n    │   └── Thanks a lot bro will think on it!!\n    ├── Don't pick ECE if you aren't interested in it. It'll be difficult to handle it along with your interest in CS\n    │   ├── Ya because i think i will have to manage ece(since profs obviously don't teach anything) and cse so will think on it...also that's why have just added ece of rvce only!\n    │   └── I think it(rvce ece) can be kept below nitte meenakshi cse specialization (since my prefrence towrds cse is more)\n    └── If you are going CS for the sake of IT placements, might get some disappointment, i think rvce ece would be better choices here\nAgain electronics is tough but doable with enough free time"

It seems like you missed those\n└── No bro i have looked at it but as much as i have researched cyber security doesn't have that much scope in India as of now also you don't get that much pakage(though getting oakage in cse is also not easy). So i don't know much about the branch that's why i left it...what would you suggest? Will do check out more on it.\n    └── Bro who said you won't get good packages for cyber sec? 💀\n\nA cyber sec professor told me Cyber security is one of most lucrative fields, if you do stuff right. Seniors will be able to better answer this.\n\nMoreover, CSE and CSE Cy have pretty similar courses up until the 2nd year, so... You won't lose anything and you also come under the umbrella of CSE if placements are what you are concerned about\n        └── Thanks alot bro i didn't knew about it that much i think quora answers shouldn't be trusted blindly!! Will try to reach out some senior and will surely add this branch!"
