      "body": "No, purchase the DDCO textbook, and start reading it if you want, epd wont really help that much, the textbook explains everything from scratch. If you dont wanna buy it im pretty sure every editions pdf is available somewhere.\n\nFind the curriculum and the respective chapters and try understanding whats going on because the slides for ddco are nothing more than a joke.\n\nYou cannot survive DDCO without a textbook, we all learnt that the hard way after our first ISA.\n├── What TB do they follow? Any good names?\n│   └── Digital design -morris mano\nComputer organisation -Carl hamacher\n│       └── that's 2 books for both the semesters respectively?\n│           └── No these 2 textbooks are for DDCO in 3rd sem\nFirst 2 units will be DD-Digital Design\nLast 2 units will be CO-Comp. Organization\n│               └── alright thanks!\n└── Don't buy the textbook lmao, that's just a waste of money, just use the soft copy, but yest, it's either use the textbook or get no marks for ddco"

      "body": "Also, ddco might be a bit overwhelming to start on your own right now, so maybe look into web tech, that subject is easier to do on your own and its also 5 credits and it really screwed all of us over.\n\nBut its easier to self study more than ddco atleast."
