      "body": ">can anyone tell how many credits do we need before graduation and how will these summer courses help?\n\n160 credits to graduate. These summer courses help by reducing the number of special topics you need to take up in final year, thus giving you more time to prepare for Masters/placements. And of course, for learning new topics.\n\n>are they free or do we need to pay?\n\nThese are charged at a certain cost per credit. You should reach out to your department for more info.\n\n>will we have special topic in 5th and 6th sem?\n\nMostly yes in 5th, nope in 6th. \n\n>does taking summer course now ease the burden in upcoming sems?\n\nAlready answered above.\n\n>and if I take a course worth 2 credits now I need now take it in 5th sem is it correct?\n\nYou will mostly still have to take it in 5th sem because each semester has a minimum number of required credits. These summer courses are primarily aimed at replacing/reducing courses you *might* need to take up in final year only."
