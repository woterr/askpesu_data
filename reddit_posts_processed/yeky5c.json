Half my batch would not have passed if it weren't for GateSmashers or NesoAcademy xD\n\nOther than this, try organizing your own notes (digital) for topics in the way that you like. I find Notion an incredibly useful tool. Regular revision is key.\n\nHere's a playlist I found, skim through and see if it helps :)\n https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrjkTql3jnm9FEOXHA_qjR-TMODlaIk-W\n└── right, thankss"
