But here's the catch, let's say even after the 2nd round of counseling you don't get the seat you desire, then you're stuck with that seat, no refund. You *have* to keep whatever you took in the first round.\n└── Do you have any idea about admission cancellation and refund, incase someone wishes to withdraw their seat? Like they say about UGC norms but I also saw people having issues with the same last year?\n    └── I'm not sure, but yeah I did hear some people were able to get a refund. You have a better chance asking on the PESU server where current first years are there."
