  "content": "For instance, for the past few days, my father has been frustrated with me and is scolding me because I do not know when the college will start and there hasn't been any official announcement yet. Basically he's putting all blame on me for not knowing when the college starts.\n\nOn top of that, both of my parents are pressurizing me to study even though college hasn't started, because they think if I do not study now, I will struggle when college starts.\n\nDue to this, I've been feeling anxious and going completely off the deep end.\n\nWTF should I do in this situation?",
