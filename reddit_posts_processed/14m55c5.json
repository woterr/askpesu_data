That's what I did. I have Dell with i5, 8th Gen, 12GB RAM (previously was 8GB, but got upgraded recently along with SSD).\n    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ But apparently u need graphic card fron 2nd year for some subjects\n    â”œâ”€â”€ See if you can get it upgraded instead of investing in a new laptop, it would save your money\n    â””â”€â”€ I suggest you ask the same question in Btechtards as well. It has a more significant community response than the PESU sub\n        â”œâ”€â”€ Okay thank you\n        â””â”€â”€ Oof ðŸ¥²\n            â””â”€â”€ ?"

      "body": "I would suggest you buy a better laptop eventually, but not right now. You can easily finish first, and maybe even second year with this laptop. If you are in AIML, it is beneficial to have an Nvidia GPU on your laptop, but it is not a must (there are workarounds). Wait for a year, by then you will realise your interests, what kind of hardware is required etc and you will be able to make a more informed decision."
