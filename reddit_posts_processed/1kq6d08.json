      "body": "The Placement Policy if any of you are confused: -\n\n1) If you get a T1, u cannot sit for any other company (FTE/FTE+Int)\n\n2) If you get T3, u can sit for T2 and T1.\n\n3) Maximum 2 offers of any Tier allowed\n\n4) U cannot get more than 1 Internship offer.\n\n5) consequence of (4) is that, if you get T2 Intern+FTE u cannot sit for T1 Intern+FTE only FTE of T1 will be allowed.\n\n6) If you reject a T2, u can only sit for T1. similiarly, if you reject a T2 Intern+FTE then u can sit for Intern + FTE of T1 ONLY (note the difference pls)\n\n7) If you get a T2 IT, u can also sit for T2 Core. Similiarly, if you reject a T2 Intern+FTE IT u can also sit for T2 Core intern+FTE\n\n8)If u get internship which gets converted, you have the right to reject/accept it and sit for FTE as placement cell treats it as just as internship.\n\n\n\n\nThis was posted on Discord by a senior a couple of weeks ago.\n├── Some people say if you have less than 60% in 12 u will not get placed in good company is that true ?\n│   ├── I have no idea coz I'm a fresher so passing this to u/rowlet-owl\n│   └── Nah, 12th is irrelevant. Haven't seen any companies pose restrictions on Boards score.\n│       └── Some companies ask for 60% aggregate throughout 10th 12th and UG\n│           └── How many is \"some\"? >95% don't ask\n├── While this is mostly accurate, the exact policy is whatever the placement cell decides when you ask them lol, since they are very non-decisive with the rules they enforce. There is no clear instruction, but to summarise, these are the broad instructions:\n\n1. For full-time offers, you can have a max of 2 offers. Once you accept an offer, or you have *received* 2 offers, you are kicked out of the applicant pool. Note that this means once you reject 2 offers, you are out of the pool, even though you are unplaced.\n\n2. Once you receive an offer from tier N, you are only eligible for tier 1 to tier N-1. So if you reject an offer from tier 2 companies, you will only be eligible for tier 1 and above. The only exception is the dream tier, where everyone is always eligible.\n\n3. For intern roles, you can have at most 1 offer. After that, you can only apply to companies that offer only FTE, with the same conditions applied as in (1).\n│   ├── acc to (1),can we have 2 tier 1 FTE?\n│   │   └── No. Once you get a tier 1 offer, you're only eligible for the dream tier. It's explained in (1) and (2).\n│   ├── summer internships don't count right? you can still apply to spring internships? \n\nalso, is it alright to reject a ppo from a summer internship?\n│   │   └── Yes you can. Although if you get a PPO from a summer intern it counts against your 2 offers.\n│   │       └── ah got it thank you!\n│   └── I did a summer internship between my 3rd and 4th year. Then, I had gotten a Tier 1 FTE + Internship through placements. A week after that offer, I got a PPO from my summer internship company. This PPO was also Tier 1. However, the PPO is an FTE Only offer and not internship. I rejected the offer I had gotten in placement to choose the PPO. Now I have only FTE through PPO and no internship.\n\nSince I rejected a tier 1 offer, does this mean I can't sit for companies that offer internship-only too? Can I sit for a tier 2 company that offers internship only? How are tiers decided for companies that offer internship only?\n│       └── An easy way to understand is to break it down. \n\n1. You got intern+FTE = 1/1 internship quota + 1/2 FTE quota\n2. You got PPO for FTE from summer internship = 2/2 FTE quota\n3. You now have used up 1/1 internship + 2/2 FTE quota. Which means theoretically, you've used up all the offers you can receive, and will be pushed out of the pool. You cannot sit for any more companies, regardless of the offer they bring to the table.\n│           └── So if someone gets placed at an IT company (any tier) can they sit for core companies?\n│               └── No. Doesn't matter if it's an IT role or core role. It still counts against your quota.\n├── if you get a t1 ppo through a summer internship can you still sit for t1 placements??\n└── There is one more thing to take into consideration. If you reject an interview on-campus, you will be blocked from all further placements. They never say this rule to you, unless you go and explicitly ask them. There are many such unsaid rules, especially when it comes to placements."
