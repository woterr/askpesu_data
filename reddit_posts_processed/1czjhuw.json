If you take admission you can submit the original marks card after you get it\n└── i have the temporary id card which was given to me on the day of exam\n    └── that should be fine or if you have Internet copy of 12th marks card. Basically a screenshot or pdf of the marks card if you saved it while checking your marks. If the website to check marks is still available login and download/screenshot your marks card\n        └── yeah i did that"
