First year is common for all branches, so they really wouldn't have done anything AIML related anyways lmfao.\n\nNot too sure here (any senior can please correct me ), but afaik AIML is just like normal CS in the first 2 years. In the 3rd year, CS core students have a choice to take their electives while AIML people have no choice"
