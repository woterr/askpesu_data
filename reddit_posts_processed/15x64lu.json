On the other hand, there is another round of counseling left. Do u think it's gonna work out ?\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ When I called them, they told that the fee is 1.6L and that we could join if we had the admission letter on us.\nâ”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Ok but I am getting through kcet and they said they still have to decide on extra clg fee\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ > there is another round of counseling left\n\nPES does not wait for all KCET rounds. \n>  And what about the induction period ?\n\nFor what exactly? Usually there is a week of bootstrap after orientation, you can find details online\nâ”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Oh ! My friend recently joined Amrita and they have an induction period. That's why I asked..\nâ”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ What is induction period?\nâ”‚   â”‚           â””â”€â”€ **An induction period in chemical kinetics is an initial slow stage of a chemical reaction; after the induction period, the reaction accelerates. Ignoring induction periods can lead to runaway reactions.**\n\nMore details here: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induction_period> \n\n\n\n*This comment was left automatically (by a bot).

My parents forced me ðŸ˜‚\nMy rank is 2029. So there is no hope for better cs seats though..\n\nBut what's with the separate batch for kcet students ?\nâ”‚           â””â”€â”€ Good luck , \nWhat are the transport facilities, if we wish to be a day scholar?\nâ”‚               â””â”€â”€ There is a college bus service. Other than that, BMTC or KSRTC buses. Metro will take a few more months to be complete..\nâ”‚                   â””â”€â”€ Thank you; Must figure out now whether to be a day scholar or hostel iteration.\nBcos I live in other part of city\nâ”‚                       â””â”€â”€ If it is more than 10km, I would say you should prefer to stay in a hostel. Travel time shouldn't be more than 2hrs. So, all the best !\nâ””â”€â”€ Can you share the link?"
