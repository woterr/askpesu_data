Like I enjoy playing table tennis everyday here. \n\nYup there is a gym inside the PE room where the other sports facilities are.\n\nAlso you can see my comment on this post about the sports facilities.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/xppr88/sports_facilities_at_pes_ec_campus/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button\n\nThe campus is pretty lively with different technical/non technical clubs conducting events every week. Workshops, hackathons are conducted in abundance here (I joined a month ago, pessat batch). Also Maaya event is coming up! Everyone is excited for that here"
