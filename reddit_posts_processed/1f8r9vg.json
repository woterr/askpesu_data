Only festival holidays will remain the same. Everything else will be different.\n        â””â”€â”€ That's what i meant ðŸ¥²\n            â””â”€â”€ Ok but posting the wrong calendar when freshers are looking for their calendar is just clickbait and someone might get the wrong info. Be more clear when you post things like these.\n                â””â”€â”€ Ok once again mb ig ðŸ˜­\nShould I delete?"
