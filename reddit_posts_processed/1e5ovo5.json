I know of 2-3 juniors max.\n\nAlso, PES workload is pretty substantial, you may not have time to prepare for GATE. You may have a little bit of free time in your 4th year, apart from your internship. Watch GateSmashers and NesoAcademy videos on YT throughout your degree, and you should be good to go 👍🏻\n└── >Watch GateSmashers and NesoAcademy videos on YT throughout your degree, and you should be good to go\n\nIs this enough or should I purchase go classes?\n    └── I do not know anything about GO classes or GATE prep for that matter.
