U stressing over nothing bh\n└── brother, 5k is not a good rank 💀 I was aiming for below 1k but now I'm fucked\n    ├── 5k out of 2 lakh is a good rank.. depends on which branch u r looking for.. there is a possibility that you might get under 3k but depends on circumstances.\n\nif cs then last round u will surely get\n\nif Ai ml then in 1st or 2nd round u will get \n\nece u will get for 3k easily\n\n  \nnot everyone under 1k will take the same college and they would most go for cse and other sister branches offered in RV, BMS.. \n\nso there is a good possibility that CS, AIML cutoff can be between 1k to 3k\n    └── Since you asked this \n\n\"Do I still have a chance of getting in? Cause I don't have anything else to fall back on\"\n\n\n\nAnswer is u can easily get into PES with that marks.. In KCET as well as PESSAT....

This year KCET paper was harder than last year's  \n2. PU exam was harder this year compared to the last year PU paper, and this time no grace marks were awarded, last year they gave like 7 marks in chemistry PU  \n3. Many ppl wouldve fucked up looking at the question paper and getting surprised looking at the deleted syllabus (myself included)  \nBut there were 90k more ppl who wrote kcet this year so u can never tell\n│       ├── these points give me some hope lol\nthanks man, lets just hope for the best on may 20th\n│       │   └── ah no problem, but dont expect the KCET results to come out on may 20th cuz thats prolly around when CBSE results come out, so they will have to take those board marks into consideration, so KCET results might come out some time after that\n│       │       └── fuuuucck ur right\n│       │           └── Hey, so if I write cbse improvement exam, which might be in July or so will that be considered in the kcet ranking?\n│       │               └── it should be yes, but u can't predict KEA 💀\n│       │                   └── I have my PESSAT exam tomorrow, any tips?\n│       │                       └── don't forget to revise the jee portions, not only the cet level portions, for example, distance of closest approach etc\n│       └── Yeah I'm getting the same score as you... hope these factors improve rank somehow\n\nBut the PU marks dont matter ig, cus everyone's are bound to improve to atleast 290+ after 2 exams\n\nI also panicked seeing the out of syllabus questions and spent less time on questions in syllabus\n\nHope for Atleast a 400 rank difference lol\n│           └── Im sorry but PU marks will matter a lot, since im from a JEE coaching institute, i know tons of ppl who r scoring around the same range as us or higher but theyve fucked up in PU, and since we have VITEEE, COMEDK, BITSAT and a bunch of other entrance exams, all of em chose not to write the 2nd attempt of PU, so ppl with good PUC marks will definitely have the upper hand\n│               └── oh okay, all my friends wrote so i assumed \n\nbut when we are talking about <1000 i think it really doesnt unless they have really messed it up and it is nothing compared to 1 mark of 141\n│                   └── Yes, there have always been more people scoring better marks in PUC compared to KCET, but it would just be wrong to say it doesnt matter at all\n└── hey i got 286 in pcm and 97 in kcet can u tell what my rank would be approximately?"
