      "body": "Dear Students,\n\nIt has come to our notice that a group of students claiming to be higher semester students are hosting a 'Freshers' Party', in private places. \n\nPlease note that all such activities are illegal and have no approval from the University.\n\nPlease do not be part of such activities which could put you in a wrong group and lead you to a situation of no return. Such activities are normally organised by a set of people trying to collect money from gullible students and in places which are unsafe and dangerous.\n\nWe have noticed such activities in the past and have reported the same to the concerned authorities, who have taken effective steps to stop them from happening, where our own students would land up as victims.\n\nThe Vice-Chancellor, Registrar and Dean, Student Affairs, PES University, have been informed about this activity. Parents are also being informed about this activity in a separate communication.\n\nStay informed, keep away from these nefarious activities and stay safe.\n\nRegards,\n\nPES University"
