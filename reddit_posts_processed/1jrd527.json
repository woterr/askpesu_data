  "content": "So i cleared my interview for pes MCA course and now they are asking me 1.6lac to block my fees with 1.5lac being refundable.  \nNow i have other entrance exams too for MCA that are in may and june which have better colleges than pes,so should i pay the amount to block my seat or will it be available during june as well?  \nAlso if i pay the full amount and cancel my seat before july,will i get refunded the entire 1.5lac?",
