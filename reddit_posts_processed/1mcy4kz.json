It's them doing their job. An exam isn't an amusement park where you can walk in when you please. Besides, forget being on time, the student arrived later than even the X mins of permissible time allotted for latecomers. You can't expect to arrive later than even the buffer time given to be late, and still get to write the test. \n\nI completely agree with you about the second incident.\n    │                       │   └── sorry i disagree with you, ec campus's main road is a very hot pocket for traffic jam and its always a half an hour traffic there and if a bus or something breaks down, its no ones fault, and the professors being egoistical as they are dont even listen to reason. Even if they allow to write an exam , the student isnt asking for extra time let them write the exam.\n    │                       │       └── You can't blame the roads and not take accountability. If you were late, you were late. If the prof didn't allow you to enter *within* the permissible time, it would've been a different question. But they arrived *much* later than that. And by your logic, students should be allowed to enter as late as they please, as long as they wrap up their paper at the same time as others. You fail to see that doing so simply encourages the behavior instead of correcting it. \n\nAcademic institutions aren't just for academic development - it's also meant to correct wrong behaviour. The goal of a deadline isn't to punish you for being late, but rather help you develop the habit of being accountable and punctual. You'll have even stricter deadlines when you start working. You can't just be late on a task and expect them to be ok with it, even if you finish it on time because there are others who are also waiting on you.\n    │                       └── The first one , the prof cannot do anything even if they wanted to because PESU has hybrid system now , which means if your 30 mins late , your computer will be locked and the control to unlock is only with the COE and not any of the profs.\n\nThis is not only in pes, after you go to write any exam(Govt or private) , job related or college admission related, if your late you wont be permitted.\n    └── A lot of them were incredibly senior teachers(Bharathi, Alpha and Annapurna) who were integral members of the CSE Department. The S&H Department teachers were also very good(Udoshi, Sachna, Lavisha), I remember Sachna ma'am especially because she did such a good job of teaching a subject almost everyone was afraid of. \n\nArvind was also very knowledgeable. Unfortunately, he had a pretty long background in industry and I don't think teaching a bunch of unruly students was something he enjoyed. \n\nDon't know/haven't heard good things about the others(Saranya, Swati Shah, Rohith Vaidya(he was very kind and approachable though))"
