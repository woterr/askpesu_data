Many people don't like being thrown colors and water on\n\n  \nBut yea, they shoulda given a holiday atleast\n├── I agree with this bt allowing to play holi obviously doesn't make it compulsory for everyone to play..! Rest of the ppl shld enjoy holiday..\n│   └── What holiday? 😭\n└── They should have designated a small area on campus to play, in EC they could have use the place btw MRD and the Hospital."
