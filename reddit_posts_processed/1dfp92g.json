Placement will happen when the person remains alive at the end of four yrs anyway\n        └── you got me there, i agree 's' in pes stands for stress\n            └── ikr I'm already breaking out "

Here, if it's PES (RR or EC) you'll be better off than taking Manipal (BLR).\n└── pes cs core vs mit manipal cse?\n    └── Comes down to personal preference. I would take Manipal cos it's more like a college than a school. But again it is the more expensive option if you don't stay near college."
