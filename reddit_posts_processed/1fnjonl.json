The last day of ESA for the first sem and first day of classes for the 2nd sem should be specified.\n└── our calendar hasnt been updated atleast for ec campus   \nit is still according to what they planned for a august 5th start\n    └── Calendars are the same across campuses for all academic purposes. Either way, the calendar should be out within a week of the first day of classes, so give it some time, it'll be out soon. Or you can ask some RR kids to share it.\n        └── rowlet bro, for rr campus coe, last day on calendar is the last day of esa, 2nd sem date is not mentioned\n            ├── yeah they have given this to ec as well but no mention of sem 2 starting date\n            └── Are you sure? There is a calendar on discord and WhatsApp groups which mentions the ESAs to be Jan 16-31 and the new sem's start date as Feb 10.\n\nCC: u/Worldly-Tomorrow-793\n                ├── nvm i am blind yeah its written in the bottom\n                └── sorry bro, even i am blind :("
