I think 70-75 is fine, but then again things might be different now.\n└── exactly which is why alot of people are confused\n    └── If I remember correctly, attendance after a certain date isn't counted. For us this date was the day they released the list of defaulters with low attendance. If you know when that date is, you can simply ensure you have >75 until that date.\n        └── ahh okay that makes sense. I'll check about the date for it. thanks :)"
