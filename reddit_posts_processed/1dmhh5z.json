A Week near ISAs we don't, apart from that it wasn't hectic with 2 ISAs so I don't know if the uni will continue with the same or change it next academic year. Assignments were usually given a week before ISA 2. Plan ahead properly and you'll be good to go:)\n└── What’s the hostel timings in amaatra and can you stay later than that outside?\n    └── If you're a girl then NO. Strict curfew timings, need to be in the hostel by 6:30 pm.\nBut for boys I don't think they care much lmao\n        └── Can you wear shorts in the hostel? Also is the warden really as bad as people say\n            ├── No you can’t, and yes, lol.\n            └── Inside your room, sure but not on the corridors or literally anywhere else. And yes she’s a bit unbearable."
