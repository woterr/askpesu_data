Are you talking about ec campus?\n│   │   └── no rr\n│   └── Even if you are at first there is temporary allotment so the warden gives you random rooms with random roommates, then after a few weeks you get to choose your roommates and rooms based off on who paid first\n│       └── oh alrr thankss\n└── Is this the case with EC campus too?\n    └── Ig so, this is in rr campus"
