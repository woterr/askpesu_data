Thank you\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ Bro thereâ€™s no coding, itâ€™s Operations Role. After OA, there will be GD, and then interview. Confirmed it with a senior\nâ”‚           â””â”€â”€ Oh ok, then why are they even hiring from b.tech; Like what's the point of hiring btech people for an operations role.\nâ”‚               â””â”€â”€ You wonâ€™t be coding. Youâ€™ll be using tools like Power BI, Alteryx, Tableau.\nâ””â”€â”€ Vit lmao"
