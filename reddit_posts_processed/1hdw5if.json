Was talking to a fresher in college one time and he bragged about how many math textbook questions he had solved and how many pyqs he had completed. Bro no one cares stfu.\n    └── Bro fr. \nI’m fresher and I’ve seen too many people like this. \nJust chill out, live a little 💁🏻‍♂️\nLot of people are still in that coaching class mentality. Hopefully they don’t continue it 4yrs down the line and into jobs🤡\n        └── Oh it absolutely will continue. Once things settle down, get ready to see people flexing how many leetcode problems they solved and how they're a knight/guardian on leetcode.\n            └── The rat race in this country never ends :')"
