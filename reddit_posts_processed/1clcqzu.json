I've seen this but I don't know if it includes all miscellaneous costs like hostel stay and stuff\n    └── Well then maybe ask what you're actually trying to get an answer to. Tuition fee was discussed on this sub just 2 weeks ago - if you had searched this sub you would have found it too. Also, the website clearly indicates the amounts mentioned to be for tuition.\n\nThis sub encourages good questions, ones which usually cannot be found by visiting the uni website or by searching this sub. Duplicate/Redundant posts are an inconvenience to everyone. I could've been nicer, but you could have also been precise."
