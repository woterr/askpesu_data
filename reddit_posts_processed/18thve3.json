      "body": "It adds value to your resume, can get you a good letter of recommendation, better repo with professors and you get paid as well.\n└── Adding to this - \n\nTAships helps quite a bit if you're aiming for Masters. They carry a lot of weight and can also help you land TA/RAships once you're there. Some applications even specifically ask if you have prior experience. Plus the working history with a prof will get you significantly stronger LORs (provided you do good work ofc). A TAship might not help you too much in getting a job though. IMO, taking up a TA role in a course you're interested in and relevant to your future career interests and what you want to pursue for MS will significantly help make you a better candidate. \n\nAnd finally, don't take up a TA role for the sake of the paycheck. There are a lot of other benefits which matter more.\n\nI was a TA back in my 7th sem, if you have any questions I'd be happy to answer.\n    └── What are the qualifications to be a TA?A good cgpa is just enough?\n        └── Here's my [previous answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/s/37P9a9ULIP)"
