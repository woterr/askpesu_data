(not saying it's a bad college, I want to know what attracted you)\nâ”œâ”€â”€ So my dream college was Bits and Pes was my second choice  but today my physics state board exam went really badly and might not clear marks so im thinking of doing pes .  \nwhat are your thoughts on the college and is it good ?\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ It's awesome if you adapt to it and vice versa\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ Ohhh and its  still worth it if i shift to it from mumbai right\nâ”‚           â””â”€â”€ If your passion is computer science then yes, and your ability to endure mental pressure ðŸ™ƒ\nâ”‚               â””â”€â”€ yess thank you so much for helping me out\nâ””â”€â”€ hey bro, i had 97.2 percentile in jm ( 41k rank) i wanted to ask you a few questions since u were in pes, please answer..\n\n1.) can i get cs in pes?  \n2.) what is the average/median package ( roughly) ( it shows just the highest on the website)\n\n3.) how much would it cost roughly thru jee mains?\n\n4.) should i look for other colleges at this percentile ( nit lower branches, some iiit ece, vit cse, lnmiit, thapar) please guide me, im so fkin confused..."

Try to score much better in April session JEE Main like 98.5 to 99++ percentile....try for IITs, I mean it isnt wasy to get top branches....but you will def get a better exposure there.....and if you only fail, omly then come to pes...keeping your goal as pes at first place is smthg...a low key....no hates please...."
