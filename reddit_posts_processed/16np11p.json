  "content": "Helloo fellow Subredditors, we are 2.2K strong however a lot of us aren't using the user flairs... Would love everyone to use the flairs as it will act like an indentity in posts, comments, polls etc...\n\nWhile asking questions or reading answers, a user flair would help know who's saying the answer/asking the question\n\nEg. Should I join PES?\nA1) User with a user flair of graduate answers, yes, but also work on building external skills\nA2) User with user flair of second year student says no, because subjects are hard and there's no club culture\n\nThe person reading would know the different perspectives and who's saying it and would overall help everyone :)\n\nHere's a guide on how to use user flairs:  (from Bard xD)\n1) Looking for \"Community Options\" or your username under \"Community Details\".\n2) Clicking \"ADD USER FLAIR\" below your name.\n3) Clicking the small pen button on the left in the \"User Flair Preview\" section.\n4) Entering your desired flair or picking one from the list.",
