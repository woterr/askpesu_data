No educational institution has the right to politicise itself like this (Please don't quote me if I'm wrong). Literally placing campaign banners just as the elections are close by.\n A few questions:\n1) Can/Should we do anything about this?\n2) What are your opinions?\n3) Will first time voters be actually influenced by such embarrassing campaigning in Universities as reputed as ours?\n\nPic 1 and 2 are from the main gate\nPic 3 is in front of the student lounge by GJB\n\nP.S: Just want to say that this is not a political party problem, this is just not the right place in my opinion. You'd probably see a post like this from me if it were another party.",

Best believe, you would've seen the same reaction if there was a INC/JDS/any political party. But I can't prove that because the banner that's up there belongs to the BJP.\n├── Really funny when I see lot of leftist campaigning during my college years in Kolkata.\nMy bachelors in Loyola saw lots of munnetra kazhagams in my campus. My \"student\" unions use to support parties during elections.\n\nI think parties will always try to influence students as they are a powerful vote bank. Students can either go with the flow and be influenced (like they do on many fronts) or do their due diligence and research and vote.\n└── >. But I still think its wrong for educational institutions to influence political views or to allow banners for a party just because the institute favours a certain agenda. \n\n\nUmm welcome to the adult world I'd say. Not to offend you in any sense but every person, everything, and every institution has a political ideology and an inclination to that. It just isn't about BJP. It is how it is, with every political party in their domain. Especially academia, is highly ideological and political. You cannot run away from it, you cannot change it either. If you are affiliated with nsui, sfi, and want a career in politics, make an issue out of this, do protests and put forward your demands. If not, don't think too much.

But this mf, was adamant on us coming. So we had to call up NSUI, national students union India. These guys were the ones who were the voice of students in other parts of the state, mangalore.

Anyway most civil engineers learn coding in parallel and try to sit for IT placements. Focus on comedk for now. Try for RVCE. Even pes seems okay since the comparison is with the civil branch of NITK. I'm really not sure. You'll have to talk with a senior who has chosen civil in NITK.
