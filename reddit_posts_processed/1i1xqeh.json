      "body": "C++ Is better, but u can also do Java if u like\n└── But doesn't PES teach DSA in C? If what OP said was true about how some companies doesn't allow DSA in C, why doesn't PES teach DSA in C++\n    ├── Because PES is PES\n    └── The reason PES teaches DSA in C is because its more easier i think, and C++ means its like learning a whole new syntax, so better to just learn in whatever we had learnt in 2nd semester. But ya, u can learn C++ on ur own & proceed\n        └── In such a case, why can’t they teach C++ itslef in sem 2. And DSA in C++ in sem 3\n            └── fair point , **but** imagine learning C++ without knowing C, it is like saying I will learn Machine learning without knowing python\n                └── Oh ok\nI didn’t know that\nAnyway thanks."

Then you can gradually shift to C++ later on.\n└── brother what about python?\n    └── You can use that too. Ideal for interview rounds for better explanation."

So each company has their own requirement, but personally i feel you should know 2 languages, Python and either c++/ java to complete the assessments of most companies.\n└──  that means you recommend me to learn c++?\n    └── Yes eventually for placements I think cpp and python would be ideal.\n\nBut at least in 3rd and 4th semester it will be better to just use C and get a better understanding of the implementation of each data structure."
