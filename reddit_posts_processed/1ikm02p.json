I talked to new people and made friends, what else do you do lmao. It’s literally just 1 semester. Your sections will change again after 2nd sem anyway.\n├── Nah most of my classmates are in same section. That is why I said I hate them and I need new people. Only very selective people got transferred. I at least want to enjoy my 2nd sem with decent mates.\n│   └── what do you hate so much about them\n│       └── Just don't like them. Yk there are always some people that don't match your vibe. They do some cringey things which sometimes involve me and it irritates me.\n└── Yo atp im also in same situation more friends better for u anyday"
