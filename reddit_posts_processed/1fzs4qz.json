I was worried about making friends and stuff(still am), but this is a silver lining I guess.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Yeah same even in rr.\nâ””â”€â”€ Huh?\n\nHow did they have 95%tile and fuck up pessat???\n\nSus\n    â”œâ”€â”€ not fk up pessat, they did good in pessat so only they joined through it\n    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Ec campus obviously they fucked up\n\nIf they didnt they would have joined rr campus\n    â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ you think getting ec campus is easy?\n    â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ My friends with 70-80 %tile(jee) \n\nHv got rr campus cse, cse spec through pessat\n\nThe same ppl have a rank 15k+ in kcet\n\n10k+ in comedk\n\nPessat had insane rank inflation aswell this year\n\nGetting ec campus is definitely easy for someone who had 95%tile+\n    â”‚       â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ the thing with these exams which have many shifts is they look kinda scammy and unfair to students\n    â”‚       â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ Yeah it is but the peer group is actually good atleast in rr and ig won't be much different in ec\n    â”‚       â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ The reason for this is Many Colleges Like BMS,MS Ramaiah and Many other colleges inflated The CS Seats and so people didn't prefer to Take the CS Seats of PESSAT and went through Comedk , Kcet.\n    â”‚       â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ They might be in CBSE\n    â”‚       â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ Comedk also Normalisation and the way it's conducted is not that True.\n    â”‚       â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ Like see first I thought that Introduction of Negative Marking is a Positive thing but Now it Looks Opposite\n    â”‚       â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Even after PESSAT introduced Negative Marking.\n    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ 95%ilers would have joined thru kcet\n    â””â”€â”€ pessat is sus\n        â””â”€â”€ Good that they removed itÂ \n            â””â”€â”€ true"

That long journey is going to take a toll on you on a daily basis.\n\n\nCrowd wise I've heard a lot of people just leave as soon as class gets over, not a lot of people stay for clubs and stuff. But some of the smartest people I know are in EC campus, try to find those smart guys in your batch and mingle.Â \nâ””â”€â”€ Sadly, due to multiple personal reasons at home, I can't be staying at a hostel :(, hence I'm stuck having to travel everyday for this long.\n\nI see, I'll mingle with them and just hope I can make good friends. Thank you for the reply, I appreciate it."
