Honestly turin is not good at all, we went all around ecity seeing other local pgs,  and even stanza living Amsterdam house. Turin is very small very shady, we went in and left in 2 minutes. Amsterdam doesn't have good connectivity to the college, it's kinda inside a Galli. Lisbon is amazing and my first friend joined there for 2-3 months, after which I recommended it to my second friend. Better connectivity to pes and Amazing food just 5 steps to the left and right. Amazing. No issues with water wifi, cleaning, food, everything is great, I'm in second year, hopefully my parents allow for Lisbon in 3rd year. Hostel is ass and I'm in Spain :(\nLet me know if you want more specific information about Lisbon, can connect you to my friends.\n└── Hey dude hope i could dm u for more info"
