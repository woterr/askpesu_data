If u don't know what that is research on it, it's super interesting stuff.\n├── Hi thank you, I'll look it up!\n└── I had a couple more questions.  \n  \n1. Was the summer course taught by people from outside PESU? \n\n2. Do we get some sort of a certificate for this?\n\n3. Are finance placements popular at PESU? Can you apply for them?"
