They just check up on everything and any problems of the class can be informed there.\n└── is the class representative a staff member?\n    └── No no, one of the students itself. They either volunteer or are chosen. Btw which semester are you in? Assuming not in 3rd cause you would have known\n        └── fresher bro, college did not start yet."
