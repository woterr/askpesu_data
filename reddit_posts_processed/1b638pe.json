There is no way to guarantee if the market will be better, but ideally should be. Leaving the market aside, the point still holds - PES placements are focused primarily for CS. Most of the other branches are neglected.\n│   └── Out of like 360-380 students only 78 of them have been placed. Join PES only if you get CS because a lot of companies that have come for CS branch have not even considered other branches. The placements in PES are focused more on CS branch than others.\n└── What if it's BCA?\nWould it come under tech branches?\n    └── This much Downvotes."
