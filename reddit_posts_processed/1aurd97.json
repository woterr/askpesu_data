Idk about your batch."

      "body": "Man request the office once. Many times students join other colleges, leaving behind a few seats. I don't think there's any harm in asking. Or else, you can go the hard route and switch branches after your first year by being in the top 1% of your dept. Again, this method isn't guaranteed to work as it depends on availability."

Apparently some committee checks potential candidates and then approves then for course change.\n├── Did it happen this year or last year\n│   └── Last year. During first sem I got shifted.\n└── ah ok, what would you mean by \"potential candidates\" though? is it those with close pessat ranks to the cutoff?\n    └── I'm not sure what they meant by potential candidate  but my pessat rank defined helped. It was just before cse cutoff."
