      "body": "Campus, syllabus, circulum,good placements too much pressure and strictness = Pes\n\nBetter Placements and hectic but not as much as Pes = rvce\n└── \"Syllabus\" and \"curriculum\" refer to the same parameter right? xD\n\nAlso, RVCE has marginally better placements, but not significantly better. \n\nThe only factors on which RVCE edges past PES are the campus/college life, on-campus opportunities (from whatever I've heard), slightly better placements and a more relaxed environment. RVCE is more well known across the country because of its ComedK intake, while PES being restricted to KCET/PESSAT restricts its reputation to around south India. Although from a top-level point of view, neither's reputation holds any significant advantage when it comes to jobs or Masters.\n    ├── \nI remember 6-7 years back Pes was on top in terms of placements, how did Pes go down?\n    └── You are indeed the pride of pesu \n        └── I swear man, the way he articulates each paragraph 🙏\n            └── Plus he carries the entire thing \nDiscord\nWhatsApp groups\nSubreddit \n                └── Wait, is he on discord and WhatsApp as well?"
