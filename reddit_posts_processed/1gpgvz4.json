Strategy will come on its own depending on ur strengths and weaknesses.   \nAre u in ur campus's WhatsApp group? Questions like this are answered there everyday.   \nAlways check if questions like this have been answered before making a post.\nâ””â”€â”€ WhatsApp groups are always getting spammed, which is why i stick to Reddit and discord. I did start. My question is clearly what i should prioritise /how i should plan. Not here for motivation lol"
