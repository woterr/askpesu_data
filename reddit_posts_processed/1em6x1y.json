What if I get no placement then 50 lakhs has just gone waste.\n    └── The management fee just straight up isn't worth it.\nGo with the comedk college\n        └── Yes that is what I am thinking. Btw is ece good branch? I know that within 5-6 years ece might have the biggest market in India but I can't trust on the basis of whatever decisions being made by the government. The actual potential of getting a high paying job is only if you apply for another country in case of ece\n            ├── If you can get into Dsce ece be ready to put in a lot of effort, as ECE is demanding. If you can get into Dsce for ECE, you should also be able to get into technical branches like AI/ML or ISE at BMSIT. PES CSE is really good but comes with a lot of competition. Keep in mind that education is priceless and not just about money.\n            └── im in a cs related branch here in dsce, from what ive heard some or most of professors in ece dept are not that good dk abt teaching but they are kinda strict n force u n treat u like school kids"
