Thanks!\nâ””â”€â”€ So, there aren't any cameras in classrooms?\n    â””â”€â”€ Student-facing? None.  \n\nProfessor-facing? *ye*\n\nEnjoy Life @ PES.\n        â””â”€â”€ Are these cameras on and recording all the time? Or just recording during classes?\n            â””â”€â”€ All the time (you can see it, the light blinks), but they're manually viewed and sorted by Impartus.\n                â””â”€â”€ Wait, does impartus still do that? Since we use ms teams now?\n                    â””â”€â”€ No idea. This was the case the last time I stepped foot in there. Graduating next month so I wish I could be more accurate ðŸ˜…\n                        â””â”€â”€ Ahh okay. Thanks for your help! :)"
