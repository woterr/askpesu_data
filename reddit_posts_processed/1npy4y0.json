I ended up with a B in the end :)\nâ””â”€â”€ This is where I fked up, its missing so many content from slides .I completely relied on this . It's good but not complete. \nI should have gone through slides side by side .\n    â”œâ”€â”€ worked fine for me, but towards the end of the sem I was learning Webdev stuff with the help of the notes and youtube for the final project guess thats what carried\n    â””â”€â”€ Lmfao same.\n\nI thought these notes were gonna put me ahead of the crowd doing the slides and fully did this.\n\nGot rodded."
