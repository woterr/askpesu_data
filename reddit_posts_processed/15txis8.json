But from a general point of view, most of the people who go to PES are kids who were brought up in Bangalore in really good English-medium and are from financially well supported families. Everyone here usually has some form of goal in mind when they join, be it higher education or placements. You will rarely come across someone who is aimlessly attending college.\n        ├── thankyou so much.\n        ├── In which campus do u study bro ?\n        │   └── I graduated in 2022. I was from the RR campus if that matters.\n        └── >plus the tech clubs at ECC are significantly better.\n\nWe ec kids used to think that RR clubs are better, now ig both are mediocre, we're finding the grass greener on the other side"
