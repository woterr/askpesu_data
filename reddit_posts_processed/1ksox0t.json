  "content": "One of my close friends recently received an offer from one of the WITCH companies. However, they seem reluctant to accept it, saying it’s not something they truly want to do. I understand wanting to follow your passion, but given the current job market and how hard it is for many people to get offers, I’m a bit concerned.\n\nIt seems like a decent starting point with structured training and job security, especially when so many freshers are still struggling. Am I overthinking this, or is it okay for them to pass it up in hopes of something better?",
