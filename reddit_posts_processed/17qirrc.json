      "body": "How can the median be more than the avg?\n└── No, it is a common misconception that median is always < mean. It is statistically possible! If the values after the median show a lesser increase than the decrease of values before median, then the distribution gets skewed \n\nFor example, for set: {1, 2, 2, 4, 8, 8, 9, 10, 10} , median = 8 but average = 6.\n\nTranslating to placement terms, this means that companies after offering greater than 12 aren't much higher than 12 (maybe 13-15). On the other hand, companies offering lesser than 12 are also offering significantly lower than 12 (2-5), bringing down the average.\n\nNo I am not fun at parties.\n    ├── In short, offers above 12lpa aren't significantly more than 12lpa and cluttered around a small range , offers below 12lpa are drastically lower and also probably cluttered towards very low values\n    │   └── Yes. Looks like placements are suffering quite a bit this time. Job market is really bad right now.\n    ├── \"pride of PESU\"\n    ├── Alr thanks\n    ├── Nerd\n    └── Should've added a TLDR over at the bottom XD😂"
