  "content": "Hello guys! I am getting pes(rr) ece and bmsce ece and hell lot of confused what to choose. I visited to campus and talked to both the college students and it created more confusion in my mind. So as far I researched and got to know is\n1. Infra : pes > bmsce\n2. Placements: not sure but PPL say it's almost similar but pes have slight edge.\n3. Free time : pes < bmsce \n4. College life : depends on the friends you make \n5. Fests : pes < bmsce \n6. Clubs and activities: pes > bmsce \n7. Hostel Life : not sure \nFor me I am completely orientiated to ece and want to do core itself. The campus and opportunities of pes tempt to me to choose pes whereas the reputation and less crowd makes me feel to go for bmsce. At this point I am in 50:50 situation. If you guys can guide me what to choose and tell me what you would choose if you were in this situation would help me a lot . Thank you .",
