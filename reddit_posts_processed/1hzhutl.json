They're infamous for sending crucial emails at random hours. \n\nThe most frustrating emails are the seating allotments which are sent sometimes 30 mins before the exam lol\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Do they still send mails regarding that? Our batch doesn't get it at least, it is reflected in the app at midnight or the day of exam\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ They used to, atleast until 2022. Not sure if they still do it. I'm referring to ESA seating allotment here btw.\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ some placement mails do come at 11PM or even later. And some event related mails come at anytime, its random\nâ”œâ”€â”€ True, lol, the same way they announced the holiday at 8:04 AM for the ex-PM's death\nâ””â”€â”€ Ahh the seating arrangement mailsðŸ‘º\n    â””â”€â”€ isnt it just updated on the app? no mail right? atleast for us, it was just on the app and we saw from there\n\nonly for 4th year, seating allotment for Special topic exams was sent by Email"
