  "content": "As a third year, I feel these are very important things freshers should know, this advice would have helped alot in my freshers year. \n1. If you fail any of the subjects, your parents will be required to attend the PTM Or the college will bar you from scholarships for the first year. \n2. If your gpa is less than 5, it will leave a mark on your placememts. The companies hiring you will be informed that you have gotten less than 5 gpa. This has affected many people's placements\n3. If you have failed to maintain 75% attendance by now, you will be barred from taking scholarships for the first year. \n4. On the day the results come out, A video will be sent to your parents containing all instances of the exam where you have conducted malpractice and your marks will be deductedforw how much ever counts you have\n5. If you have failed to acquire atleast 6 sgpa, you will not be given a pes email. The email will be withheld till you aquire 6 sgpa Or above. \n",
