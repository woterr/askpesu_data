India needs more manufacturing, infrastructure and transportation and with push coming from the center all these are soon to come into demand. And IT companies are hiring less and less freshers by the day. Once AI gets over it's hype cycle and starts to get deployed in big tech the run of the mill coders would be out of jobs. There would be no justification to 16 sections of CSE while only 10 sections everything else combined.\nâ””â”€â”€ around 16LPA median and 18LPA average for CSE\n    â””â”€â”€ source?"

It's hard but not impossible\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ then why do so many people join bruh?  \nlike I think paying 25 lakhs is better then joining some new horizon type college.\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ Isn't that a no Brainer?\nâ””â”€â”€ the people who its not worth are the ones who will still join.   \nSee u cant rly put a price on ur future, the money saved wont be worth shit in 10 years. You will anyway be earning 30-40 lakhs eventually."
