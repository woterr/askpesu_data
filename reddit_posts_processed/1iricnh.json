Every company needs people for different roles, some of which need Java, Python, C/C++ and so on. If you're focusing on DSA I'd recommend C/C++. Learn languages when you need to work on a problem in a specific field.\n    └── Oh okay. Thank u for correcting!"

Languages are just tools use the one which is appropriate for that situation.\n└── Thanks\n    └── As OC said, this is discussed every year and there's a question on the FAQs dedicated for this. Go check that out for more details."

      "body": "the point of using C is for more deeper understanding of DSA in terms of memory allocation and manipulation. But from the industry pov C is lesser relevant and they expect some level of abstraction in order to understand things better. Hence they recommend OOP languages such as java, C++ and python. If you practice in C you will be able to understand the logic and be able to code in other languages too."
