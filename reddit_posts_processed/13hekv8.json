      "body": "Yes, it does increase your CGPA, but it primarily comes from your internship (8th sem) grade and capstone phase 2. Since the special topics are only 2 credits each and totally only 3, they won't affect your grade too much. Capstone 2 and internship both being 6 credits each are the most important aspects, try to do well in reviews and perform well in your internship in 8th sem. Capstone 3 in 8th sem is again only 2 credits so don't expect too much from that."
