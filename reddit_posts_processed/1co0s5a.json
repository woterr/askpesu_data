This was answered multiple times over the last 2 weeks and there are numerous posts about it.\n\n>My jee main percentile is 92. Is it possible to get any good branch or any branch in PES University\n\nCutoff for CS is 98 percentile. Other branches will be lower than that.\n└── Thanks for help .\nI tried searching may I missed it \nCan you link the post please 🙏"

      "body": "They are not at all transparent about that. Not one bit. \n\nThe only help i can give you is that I knew a guy in ec campus CSE who got ~98 percentile. I also know he applied kinda late so that might be a factor as well. \n\nYou most likely will not get cs or ece with 92 percentile so don't get your hopes up. But apply nonetheless. Also just go write pessat, it's easier to get in and for the same fee\n├── What about 96 percentile?\n│   └── Cs is still difficult. Ece is possible. Still though no harm in trying. \n\nBut just go write pessat dude, you'll easily get cs. Why do you care lol it's the same fee anyways\n│       └── I messed up my pessat lol\n│           └── Bro you will still get a good rank chill. I got like 85 percentile in jee and got some 1500 rank in pessat. Not enough for cs in rr but good for everything else.\n│               └── No dude you dint understand i attempted 90/180 absolutely no chance\n│                   └── Why though. Even attempting all questions randomly will result in a net positive marks right? And considering that someone like you will easily be able to eliminate one or two options per question\n│                       ├── I was not feeling well . Thats why else i would have attempted more\n│                       │   └── Fine fine. Nothing you can do now. Just write the remaining as best as possible and hope you get lucky somewhere\n│                       │       └── Yeah... My main focus is now on comedk , the campus was nice especially the computer lab\n│                       │           └── Hey is comedk still taking applications? Asking for a friend. \n\nBut yeah, write comedk very seriously. You can get really good colleges with minimal effort\n│                       │               └── Comedk application are closed , yeah i hope i can crack it man any tips?\n│                       │                   └── I only got like 3k rank so not so much. But it's basically like kcet.

This will net you a positive of 0.25 marks per 4 questions. You can use binomial to find the distribution if you want. \n\nEven randomly you're more likely to gain marks than to lose them\n\nNow let's say that you're not a vegetable and you're able to eliminate one wrong option in every question. This way the odds are 1 in 3. Do binomial again and look at the distribution\n│                               └── I really want to agree to this, but using this logic in JEE Mains gave me a horrendous result in the first session.  \n\nThere’s no guarantee that I get 1 answer out of every 4 questions correct either, it’s not as simple as performing a binomial distribution to this because I’ve left the toughest questions unanswered, knowing that the risk is too high.\n│                                   └── Yes obviously there is no guarantee that you will get exactly 1 out of 4 correct. But as the number of questions increases the probability that the outcome will fit the distribution also increases. \n\nIt is actually as simple as applying the binomial distribution lol. Probability doesn't lie. Do you not trust the math which you're currently learning.\n│                                       └── Probability never lies, but when you take in the factor of the time remaining, and that I’ve only left the toughest questions, the chances of me guessing the answer correctly gets thinner and thinner. \n\nI’m confident of the 104 questions that I’ve attempted and I’m sure that guessing the remaining questions in the very little time I had would result in a majority of negative marks. This is indeed a high risk high reward game and I didn’t want to feel the “this is why you shouldn’t gamble, kids.” kind of vibe after my results come in. But let’s hope for the best.\n│                                           └── Bro probability doesn't care how tough the question is lmao\n│                                               └── You mentioned that it’s likely to be able to eliminate an option or two so it increases the probability of getting the answer right. And if the question itself is tough and I’m not able to eliminate any option, then of course the probability is dependent on the difficulty of the question.\n│                                                   └── Either way you're most likely to get a net positive mark. If you can eliminate, then you're more likely to get a net positive mark\n│                                                       └── Same logic applies for jee tho no?\n│                                                           └── Yeah. Its what have me atleast something. \n\nLiterally in chem i didn't know a single question. In all entrance exams i basically guessed every chem question. Skipped the entire subject 😂\n│                                                               └── How much did this get you?\n│                                                                   └── 89 percentile i think. \n\n1.5 hours for math, 1.5 for phy. Last 5 minutes to guess cham😅\n\nI wish I was able to mug up something atleast\n└── I thought of writing pessat but application forms are over but they are allowing to write the exam even after late registration but the cache is I can only get my exam centre at bangalore campus and I live in west Bengal.\nMoreover the last date of exam is 12 May, so I guess it's not feasible."
