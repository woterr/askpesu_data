      "body": "Hostel and mess fee collectively is 1.53L if you got NBX, If you got IT Block then it's 1.38L\nâ””â”€â”€ Which one Should one Take(Pros/Cons) and This for RR Campus. Right?\n\n(Thanks for Responding because Even though I asked this Question many more would likely see it and It will Help them also)\n    â””â”€â”€ IT Block:-\n\n    Triple Sharing, Common Washroom\nPros:-\n    The rooms are designed in such a way that every student gets a personal corner of it's own which is quite spacious\n    You'll be able to socialise with people on your floor as you'll be seeing them every other day.\n     Has a small garden which is kinda good\n     Cheaper. \nCons:-\n  Leeches and other insects might crawl up to verandas on the Ground floor.\n  Might take you some time to get accommodated to the Common Washrooms. \n\n\nNBX Block:-\n   Triple Sharing, Attached Washroom.\nPros:-\n  Cleaner and better tables, shelves, doors.\n   Wi-Fi works kinda better than IT Block.\nCons:-\n  The rooms don't have any segregation. You'll be aware what your roommate is doing at all instances. No privacy.\n        â””â”€â”€ >Leeches and other insects might crawl up to verandas on the Ground floor\n\nBruh!!\n\nThis Reason alone will most Probably be a Huge Turnoff for Many People thinking of Opting IT Block Hostel!!\n            â””â”€â”€ Nobody opts for IT Block willfully ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£.It only mattered for a half a month at max.\n                â””â”€â”€ So like is there any First Come First Serve scene in case of Hostel Allotment?\n                    â””â”€â”€ Yes. You have to pay first.\n                        â””â”€â”€ When do we have to usually Pay for Hostel?\nLike Just before Class Commencement or like 1 week before it or something like that?\n                            â””â”€â”€ If you still haven't paid. Start searching for a pg already. Many parents book hostel on the day on offline councelling itself.\n                                â””â”€â”€ Ahh Shit!!\n\nI could have got CSE in Round 1 but choose not to attend Round 1 and instead wait for Round 2.\n\nI did not knew about this thing like AT ALL!!"
