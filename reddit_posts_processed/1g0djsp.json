You have to stay in amaatra or what you say living space and travel for all the years. \n\nIf you are a doctor in pes hospital, I have no idea about the procedure, and moreover you can't apply for the on-campus hostel online afaik.....\n└── i am going for btech, and i am aware of the hostel outside the campus\n\nbut there is no direct info on the link given in the pes website\n    └── Yea, there isn't, you have to contact the warden directly.... you will get the mobile number in the living space website I guess.... I remember contacting the warden on mobile and confirming whether there are empty places in any of the rooms so that I could join\n        └── oh damn\n\nso do you call them after college reporting ?\n            └── If you are sure that you are reporting to this college only, you can pull out the contact number and call them\n                └── alright\n\nThank you so muchh !!!"
