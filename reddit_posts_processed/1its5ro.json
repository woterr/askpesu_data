There were instances when questions came from it directly in ISAs.\n└── what's that?\n    └── https://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/interactive/\n\nJim Kurose book's end of chapter questions with answers.\n        └── thanks man🙏\n            └── No problem\n\nAlso, we had 3/4 Four Markers as numericals so prepare accordingly 👍\n                └── ahh thanks a lot, this really helps.\n\nalso if you dont mind could you tell me more about the other subjects isas as well 😭\n                    └── OS: 2 were scheduling numericals, 1 was explaining the code and 1 was theoretical. Study properly from the slides to answer MCQs correctly.\n\nMPCA: 4Ms were like tough and I personally didn't like them. Even MCQs were tough. Mostly the paper was numerical based.\n\nDAA: It will be easy dw just study the concepts properly. Plenty of yt resources available for this.\n\nLAA: Scoring paper, it will be easy.\n                        └── Thanks a lot!"
