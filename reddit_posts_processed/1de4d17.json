  "content": "MSc Psychology is a new course that has been introduced in PES. I was wondering if I should consider it since it's the first year of the course. The counselor told me that 85% is needed to get placements, I have no idea what she meant by that. \n\nCould somebody help me understand how placements work? Also what's the hostel situation like? Is there a dress code? It is the ring road campus, are there pgs around? Also, if somebody is studying BSc psychology, how is the faculty like? Any detail would be appreciated. Thanks!",
