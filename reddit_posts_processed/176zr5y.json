Why though\n│       ├── Bro, ISE ≈ CSE as it has 95% same syllabus + same placements + older branch. You can check KCET cutoffs too, CSE then ISE then CS specs.\n│       │   └── Oh thanks i didn't know\n│       └── Ise has greater similarity with cse core actually so yeah\n├── wait so rv spec is better than pes cs?\n│   └── I personally don't think so. The RV cse spec courses are introduced recently and not even a single batch has graduated yet. RV is just banking on the fact that these courses will be successful based on the college's existing reputation. And from purely placements perspective, I've heard a lot of good things about PES CS from my friend who studied there. So definitely pes cs > rv spec\n└── Hey, please use the user flair!"
