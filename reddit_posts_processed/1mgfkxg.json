If the seats remaining are less you'll need a very high gpa but if theres more seats, more ppl can move so the cutoffs decrease. For my batch we need around 9.45 to get cse rr\n└── How does the seat vacancy be predicted ?  \ndoesnt pes intake to their max capacity ?\n    └── Some people leave the seat last minute even though they dont get a refund. They seat vacancies cannot be predicted, you have to just wait till 2nd year to know. Or you can try asking the administration dept, idk if theyll tell tho"
