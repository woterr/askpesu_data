I was quite surprised too\nâ””â”€â”€ I think there were 100+ students on the waitlist ðŸ’€ that's what a friend told\n    â””â”€â”€ i heard there were 300+ on waitlist for CSE in RR campus lol. IDK about its current status though"

That's why people are judging you.\n        â””â”€â”€ Thanks for letting me know your perspective. I believe, when it comes to placement scenario, its the knowledge and skills of an individual that matters the most. A good college is just a gateway to a lot of opportunities. So, here, in my case, not only in core, I'm also interested in IT. So considering all the above factors, i'm planning for management. I unfortunately couldn't make it through PESSAT, seat surrender being the lowest this year. So, if there are any seat surrenders in latter days, I should be good to go.\n            â””â”€â”€ I'm not judging you or questioning your skills - I myself have friends from management who are currently working at great companies. I agree that skills are all that matter. But you also need to understand the demographic of the students who opt for management usually does not include the likes of you.\n                â”œâ”€â”€ That's true, I totally agree with you. People you mingle with have a greater role to play on your overall personality, whether they come through merit or MQ.\n                â”œâ”€â”€ Hey could you tell how the demographic is that opts for  management ? Doesn't pes ask for high board marks for management students to ensure it's not easy to get in even through management?\n                â””â”€â”€ Hey could you tell how the demographic is that opts for  management ? Doesn't pes ask for high board marks for management students to ensure it's not easy to get in even through management?\n                    â””â”€â”€ Do you really think Board marks are representative of academic quality? How many people in your own school have crossed the 80% threshold?\n                        â””â”€â”€ Honestly not many crossed the 80% threshold ðŸ’€ but I get your point.\n\nWo usually management quota students dont do well in pesu?\n                            â””â”€â”€ Most of them are here because of financial privilege and just scrape through classes year after year"
