  "content": "I'm writing the Physics Backlog this month and a few people told me notes and slides are enough to prepare. If I do only the notes is it enough to get an E grade? E grade in the backlog is 40 marks, if I understand correctly. Also what additional things are there in the slides that are missing in the notes?",
