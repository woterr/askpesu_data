      "body": "Honestly depends on what you're interested in. Want CS? Go for it. Want ECE? Go for it. Anyway both campuses share the same placements, so go for the subject you're passionate about, imo. There are slight tradeoffs in each campus to keep in mind, such as RR campus being very small and packed but having a lot of events and more facilities, and EC campus being much bigger but little to no events, and fewer facilities. Hope this helped!"

CS isn't easy but compared to ece, it's a bit more chill and manageable. Ec campus isn't too bad either, they're just a bit more strict"
