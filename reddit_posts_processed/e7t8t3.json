I would love for this place to become more active.  \nThe main problem I've encountered trying to get this place active is that a lot of people don't really use Reddit for much besides memes. Besides that, a lot of the people who do prefer to keep their accounts anonymous and are hesitant to participate. I'd love to know if there are any ways we can turn that around though!\n└── yeah it's okay if they keep their accounts anonymous, not an issue,, but we can still talk about stuff/share memes or information and just in general make it an active sub right?\n    └── Absolutely, memes are expected and more than welcome on a forum like Reddit.\n        └── sure, spread word and get people(?)\n            └── Yess"
