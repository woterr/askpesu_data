      "body": "The assignments and questions tend to change with every year with slight changes to the syllabus. That's why most resources created by seniors tend to get outdated very quickly. However, the syllabus doesn't entirely change usually so if you want to find solutions to labs or assignments (or even past projects), an easy way is to google \"<course code/name> PESU GitHub\" and they should pop up. \n\nHere is an example: [https://www.google.com/search?q=ddco+pes+university+github](https://www.google.com/search?q=ddco+pes+university+github)\n└── Hi thanks that’s a smart way to go about this"
