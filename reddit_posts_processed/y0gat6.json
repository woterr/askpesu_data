Also, I heard that the Pro-Chancellor told the 5th semester students that they are not going to remove it despite multiple complaints. Is it true? I get multiple sources of fake news about it. One day someone tells me that none of the students have complained and that's why they haven't removed it. Can anyone give me proper info on it?",
