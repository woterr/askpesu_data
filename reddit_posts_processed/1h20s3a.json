You tell me lmao. \n\nIO was a really great initiative unfortunately ruined by money. It was never about the certifications or paychecks until 2020 or so when they started making it paid.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Kinda figured the same, but someone told me otherwise. So I wanted to confirm. \nAnyway gotcha, thank you!!\nâ””â”€â”€ Such a good imitative, ruined by dumb priorities and management team"
