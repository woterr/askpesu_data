      "body": "Getting an 8+ requires you to at the very least, get an 8.0 grade point in every course, which translates to a B grade in every course. B grade in every course means getting a 70+/100 in every course in your overall score of ISA+ESA+assignment. It's hard to predict using a single ISA score.\n\nGetting an 8+ isn't that difficult since you can effectively lose 30 marks out of 100 and still get it. Similarly, getting a 9 GPA means getting 80+ in every course. You can play around with the score for each ISA/ESA and figure out how much you need to score, given that these will be scaled. \n\nNext time, read the FAQs. The GPA question has this explained in detail and even has a GPA calculator to automate things like this."

I doubt spending 2 minutes on a three line reddit post would disrupt someone's study schedule. If you're so bothered by a post, why not downvote and move on?\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 1st year is the easiest year to maintain a good gpa...they might have heard about it many times too.And c'mon we all have been through that phase"

I still have PSTD from my first ever ISA for math, lowest score I've gotten in any ISA till date. But they relative graded it and I ended up getting a decent grade. Don't worry about it, study for tomorrow's exam."

      "body": "This is your first actual test and its okay for things to go wrong, make sure you learn from it.  \nIts hard to comment on cgpa because that depends on how your overall batch has scored and whether you will be relatively graded or not. So even if you do post these questions here you are unlikely to get what you are looking for (cause even we don't know its been volatile even for us)  \n  \nMath papers will be lengthy but if you practice well , the logic will come to you naturally. Build up day by day. Try different methods of studying and see what works best for you. You'd have more than a month between isa's so it gives you enough time to try out textbooks , slides , notes (or even paying attention in class :P) and see which helps you the best.\n\nThings that work for some won't work for others. Ultimately, it comes down to your hardwork and staying level headed cause it gets worse down the line, and by then people expect a certain level of professionalism from you and expect you to handle things like this.\n\nSo what I'm saying is you have enough time to make mistakes and its not the end of the world , experiment and enjoy your first year dont take things too seriously but dont let things go entirely, You'll figure it out , like we all did :)\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ is the grading system absolute or relative?\n    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ It's absolute, but if a batch underperforms they modify the grading system a little.

And if you see, an 8.0 is very much possible, if your efforts are anywhere between Scenario 1 and 2 then you're chilling.\n\noh and also to check if you can get 8.5+, use this gpa calculator: [https://pesupedia.vercel.app/academics/gpa.html](https://pesupedia.vercel.app/academics/gpa.html)"
