The method of shortlisting varies but it's mostly about resume, portraying your skills the best way possible, network to an extent, etc\nâ””â”€â”€ is getting into centre of excellence tat easy? cause i applied for cdsaml and have decent projects in aiml but didnt hear back :(\n    â”œâ”€â”€ They will call you for interview immediately after esa ig. Thatâ€™s what happend to me\n    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ oh alr thanks man\n    â””â”€â”€ They sent out a mail to shortlisted students 2 days ago.
