That's a pretty well-reputed college within the city.\n└── nope, PES would be a better option here\n    └── I'm a PES graduate and during my own placement season before the intake increased massively, placements were still a pain in the ass with 1300+ people. I can only imagine how difficult it gets from here with the intake getting much higher."
