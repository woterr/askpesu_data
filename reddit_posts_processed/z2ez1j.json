Look at the kcet cutoffs for each. Pes rr aiml is preferred over pes ec campus cse.\n└── CSE with AiMl is first batch so could it be risky to prefer AiMl over CSE.\nCSE has more scope than Cse with AiMl ig.\n    └── Aiml probably differs by only few subjects with regular cse. From placements pov it shouldn't matter much at all.\n        └── But it's first batch AiMl in Pes\n            ├── Yeah many colleges have introduced new branches only to increase seats.\n            │   └── To suck more money rather.\n            └── I agree with your statement, but when it comes to placements, we get the usual CSE ones AND the AI-specific jobs too. And yeah, AI is gonna be the future, so learn it when you can.\n                └── AiMl is the future but it won't reach CSE's level anytime. Also it will take AiMl 7 to 8 years to start getting boom like CSE had in early 2000's."

And PES started the kcet batch on Nov 7th itself\n    │           └── Yes this is 1 thing. You will lag behind in portions a lot. But yeah, you have helpful seniors and people like venkat to help you out.\n    │               └── Hey hey, I'm not a senior, I'm not even in pes any longer, joined rvce, but I'm trying for the extended round too, so just shared my research😁\n    │                   ├── Ahh i see, all the best for your future too!\n    │                   │   └── Thanks man, you too😁\n    │                   └── isn't rvce the best? which college are you targeting now in the extended round?\n    │                       └── I was trying to upgrade from cybersecurity to data science, and just got it today!\n    │                           └── Awesomee! Congrats :)\n    │                               └── Thanks :)\n    └── The con is that idk what procedure happens when you choose choice 2. Prolly you need to pay 10k or smth to lock seat. \n\nAnd yeah, what I told is what I saw in round 1. So it's better if you first wait for the 4 options and then take your decision.\n\nOne of my friend is also going with round 2, I'll ask him and tell you what to do."
