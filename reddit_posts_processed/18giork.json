So try to score above 35 in everything in the next isa .\nDefinitely it ain't a piece of cake , but definitely doable\n└── heyy, if I've gotten a 145 5 subjects in isa 1 how much would I need in isa2 for a 9+? thank you\n    └── Probably 180. That'll get it to 160 avg. Those are the people who got 9+ in my friend group\n\nBut yeah it depends on esa. I know a few who did a complete 180 in it\n        └── cool, thanks:)"
