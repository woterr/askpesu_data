Need to being/buy your own mattress.\n\nBut you would need to meet the warden, introduce local guardian, buy the appln. form (Rs.100), fill it out and pay the hostel fee (Rs.1.35l or Rs.1.53l) before admission.\n└── When will this happen any specific date?\n    └── You need to complete the formalities before 19th Aug. It's on first come first serve basis\n        └── are you sure classes are starting from 22nd aug? What about jee advanced?\n            └── Unfortunately, PES is least bothered about other college admission processes, with the possible exception of KCET. \n\nIn fact, I think they start early and collect fees upfront so that students give up on IIT/NIT/BITS as they have a confirmed seat and have locked up the tution fees in PES\n                └── Back during my admission time, the fees paid was refundable given that you got into any of those colleges you mentioned, or you got a seat via CET at PES for the same branch. Is it not the same anymore?"
