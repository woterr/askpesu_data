Ask for Amaatra hostel or Amrita college.\n├── Thanks a lot!\n└── Isnt there a bus stop in front of PES ECC ?\n    └── That's the one (Konappana agrahara)\n        └── Oh I thought Konappana agrahara bus stop was 700 meters from the PES main gate. This is what google map shows\n            └── It is 700M from EC campus. There is no bus stop at immediate distance from the college. This is an average PESU student struggle.\n                └── So in short its a 20 minute walk from classroom to bus stop\n                    └── Yes.\n                        └── Where do you live and which bus do you use?"
