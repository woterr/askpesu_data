Be quick to finish your hostel formalities as rooms can get filled pretty quick . If you cannot get hostel they are many pg options available.\n└── Is there any transport facility provided ? What could be the chances of getting hostel in second round counselling?\n    └── College buses are available to almost all parts of blr if that's what you are asking . There is also college bus service from ec campus to first years hostel.\nIn second round the chances of you getting hostel with attached bathroom is low , you will get ones with common bathroom."
