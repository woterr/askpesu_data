So, I don't think that's possible.\n└── Yea but i did get within 8k i got within 2k itself\n    └── oh sorry i read your rank as 16xxx. That's a pretty good rank! There's a high possibility that you can upgrade then, Good luck🍀\n        └── Haha no prob thanks 😊\n            └── Which branch are you upgrading from?\n                └── ECE\n                    └── I think you can get core CS as well in ECC, not sure."
