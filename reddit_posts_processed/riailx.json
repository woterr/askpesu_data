Some emails have it worded and formatted differently or attached in like a PDF or something. Tbh it doesn't matter all that much, I can tell you that the highest paying companies (Apple and Microsoft) asked for 8+. \n\nKeep your GPA as high as you can though because it means you can get your elective+prof preferences more easily and you can get scholarships.\n\nEdit : I can dig around for the cutoff of a specific company if you want, but I can't do a full fledged data analysis and give you a distribution or anything like that\n            â””â”€â”€ Having above 8 does guarantee Tier 2 (98% of the time)\nElegibility, gotta wait for the end of placement report of 2022 ðŸ˜‚"
