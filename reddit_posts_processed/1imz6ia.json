I have tried to make new friends but everybody are in their own groups that they prefer. Is this how my college life is gonna end. It's affecting me a bit too much lately that i don't even have proper friends in college. Is it just me who's going through this?",

I was introvert when I joined pesu which was also a major reason for not getting the girl whom i loved the most.  I didn't express to  her and it ended abruptly without any clarity. After this phase I literally joined few clubs like music club, rotaract,aikya etc where I met many people and got some friends I became extremely extrovert.  But in end of the day everybody got job in different fields or companies and few of them decided to pursue higher education but still I made lot of memories especially in Sutta Gully which I will cherish in my life. Also I am grateful for whatever happened in my life. I would like to suggest you to join some clubs in college try to participate in more events try to meet new people start conversation with them. Make memories and Enjoy your life...👍"
