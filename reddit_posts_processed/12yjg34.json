  "content": "I really wanna know if pes is good for bsc psychology. Ik that there are other better colleges to do psychology but most of the good ones only offer ba psychology and I wanna do bsc. I also  know that pes is good for engineering but I have no idea how good it is for other bsc courses.\n\nInitially I did wanna apply to christ but after doing some research (reading endless reddit posts) I came to the conclusion that I wouldn't want to go to such an institute that's so rigid and don't gaf about individuality.\n\nHonestly speaking pes is the only good option for me atp. I really need your advice.",

Don't join this course over here \nIt's a tech heavy college \nConsider Christ University for Psychology in Bangalore. \nYou will meet more like minded people and some great faculty. \nOther suggestions would be liberal arts colleges \nFrom PES Student\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ i tried for christ and i didnt get in and my only other option is jain other than pes. I read the reviews for jain online and they do not seem to be okay\nâ”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ Still I won't recommend PES .\nâ”‚       â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ How are the faculty members? How is the placement for this course? Another advantage is that this is  4 year course compared to other 3 year courses. Additionally, How are the people in this course?\nâ”‚       â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ >rogram is almos\n\nhows it?\nâ”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Why not?\nâ”‚       â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Multiple reasons but the biggest one being that PES mostly focuses on engineering, this matters a lot coz college won't take any major decision that benefits your interest.\nâ”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ Hey what about Ramiah. They also offer bsc psychology.\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ yes me too what did you end up\npicking?\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Did u try to apply in ramiah? Their program is almost similar to what pes offers\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Hey how easy is it to get into pes university for bsc psychology?\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Hey can I know which university did you choose to proceed with your bachelors studiesÂ \nâ””â”€â”€ Heyyy... Which one did u choose now?"
