      "body": "If you are a beginner then start with easy, medium questions from either gfg, leetcode or hackerank. Practice them a lot until any problem from those sets makes you comfortable.\nOnce that's done you could move on to hard problems.\n\nFor tips: trees, graphs, dp, recursion are some of the highly important topics for tier 1 companies. So, go through them and practice questions on those. \nBuild up your analytical and aptitude too."
