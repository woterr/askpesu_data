I noticed this today at the GJBC canteen. A guy was putting his arms around a girl's should and sitting and then a watchman walked in, scolded them in front of everyone with hand gestures and all. Soon after a bouncer and another watchman came in. All three scolded them, made a few calls, took their id cards and escorted them. Ig they were from the UG. I've seen Watchmen and bouncers walk around everywhere suspiciously so I just wanted to know wtf is up with that and why is pesu soo against couples \n",

Plus doing arrange marriages are far better since you get dahej money and you can invest the earnings into other ventures and you'll easily make more money. PESU people think so much about you.
