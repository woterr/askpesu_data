What that bro?\n\nI been swimming through mud pools, fighting heat strokes and what not to get to clg and back.\n\nBut on a serious note, definitely lesser holidays than other colleges around and less forgiving. During the semester maybe around 10-15 days due to festivals, public holidays etc.\n\nAround 1-2 weeks after odd sem.\n\n2-3 months after even sem.\n\nCheck the FAQs once.\nâ””â”€â”€ like even after 1 sem do we get 1-2 week holidays??? because someone only 25 th is a holiday for the first sem.\n    â””â”€â”€ No you atleast get a week I'm sure."

Check your calendar all holidays are given there.\nâ””â”€â”€ what abt diwali times   \ndo we get a few holidays for that or no\n    â””â”€â”€ Mostly 1 day for festivals if it is a big one. During ongoing semesters holidays are less"
