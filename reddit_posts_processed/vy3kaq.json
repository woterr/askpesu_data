That was my experience there.\n\nGathering some info from my juniors, with the new internal exam structure and silk board traffic, unless you're willing to study for JEE at every waking moment, forget about it. First year is PCM with programming (C and Python). They are very similar to what you know. Quantum physics is taught in more depth here. You might get time, but I wouldn't be too optimistic unless the scores there aren't your main concern.\n\nThe placements for CSE are great. For core ECE, there are very few companies that come. But they do come. All can sit for almost all companies if you have the GPA (8-8.5+ which is **NOT** easy in ECE)\n\nFrom my time, it has been really good. My seniors were accomodating, and we tried to reciprocate but COVID so didn't achieve much in that department. Hopefully a junior might shed light here. \n\n95 percentile with 50% syllabus ain't bad homie. If you're confident enough that a drop year can help you get into an IIT, go for it. Worst is you'd get a better rank next year in PESSAT and hopefully get into RR. (Way better faculty and clubs and stuff, atleast when I was there)"
