If you however take a seat in PESSAT the last date to withdraw will be September 24th beyond which you won't get your money back. I'm not sure about what will happen in the second round and whether that will require an additional fee .\n└── wait so I have a rank good enuf for CS at RR, what if I ditch the first round and, go to the second round, will I still get that seat?\n    └── If you are sure you'll get a seat with your rank then sure you can go ahead and try in the second round. It's a gamble but if your rank is pretty high then you can consider it\n        └── my rank is 200, so ig will surely get it. but wont all the cs seats get filled by then(second counselling) at rr campus  (so my rank wont matter anymore right?)"
