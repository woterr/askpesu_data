      "body": "Generally, students with a GPA above 8.75 get MRD. Now this is not like an official cutoff. The number keeps moving around. It is just to give you an idea. The scholarship amount is 20% of the tuition fee. The exact amount you get depends on the fee you paid. And mind you, only a part of what you paid is the tuition fee. So, when I received it, Rs. 1.1 lakh was my total fee, but only Rs. 65k was the tuition fee. So I received a cheque of Rs. 12.5k, for one semester. I don't remember the exact number, but folks who paid Rs. 3.2 lakh in fees received a cheque of around Rs. 50k.\n├── It's the top 20% of each branch. So if you're in CSE and there are 600 kids then the top 120 get. The lowest SGPA in that range (for CS atleast) comes to be around 8.6 to 8.7. This again depends on the actual SGPA values themselves, since if everyone does poorly then the lower end of that SGPA range also dips.\n└── 65k was your annual tuition fee?"
