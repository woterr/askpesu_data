      "body": "Srsly thank you for this sub all the mods especially u/rowletowl who literally has made everything so easily accessible and kind of basic faqs seen which ainâ€™t really there in other subs(Atleast ones which are similar in size to this one). Thanks to the mods as well for their help:)\n\nIn terms of suggestions I canâ€™t really think of that many except maybe having a couple more mods we can reach out to? And maybe a sort of thread where juniors can ask seniors stuff and hence can check if their question has already been answered? It may even exist I just havenâ€™t seen it ig lol ;)\nâ”œâ”€â”€ got it, but what if we had a chat channel with seniors + connecting with actual seniors, i guess, the discord channel is better as compared to reddit\n\nProblem with reddit has always been, verifying a \"senior\"\n\nSo, if you need some senior help, i guess discord is the way to go, or let me know if we need a separate chat channel\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Yes honestly thatâ€™s sound like a great idea, and even maybe one more for us to speak with seniors that are working or doing higher studies rather than say limiting ourselves just to people studying in pes. Maybe even create a separate channel for itâ€¦\nâ”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ on it, will be created\nâ”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Awesome stuff thanks a lot !!\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ This already exists. There is a discord server for alumni who are studying abroad. You can DM me for the link.\nâ””â”€â”€ Glad I could help :D"

Kudos to all of them and to everyone who has contributed to the betterment of this sub.\nâ””â”€â”€ I can give the mod duties, but this will again be converted to a college propaganda spreading + used for club/event promotions (i can be wrong, but this has happened in other subs)\n\nAnd the mod duty honestly is reviewing and sanity check of posts which doesn't take much time, but will keep in mind to see if we have like a rolling mod system or something\n    â”œâ”€â”€ I don't feel there are any complaints regarding current moderation set up\n    â””â”€â”€ Give me mod duty now atleast:kekhands:\n        â””â”€â”€ hahahahahah\n\nLet's discuss soon; mod owls are scary (duolingo)"

So kindly keep a check on those users and ban them accordingly.\nâ””â”€â”€ This is true, but again, the bad posts are also sometimes fun to read xD\n\nI don't want to hold a personal bias and judge if they are right or wrong; however, if a lot of people have reported it, i definitely do take it down.\n\nFeel free to report whatever you don't like/doesn't go well with the sub. Happy to review and remove"
