We used to talk about getting CSE in PESU a few days back on this sub reddit..Did you get it?\n    └── Yeah I member you. What a joke dude, the cutoff was like 2400. I easily got it\n        ├── Actually the cutoff wasn't really 2400. It went upto that cuz only 472 people came. I though everyone will take cse at ec campus but some took AIML too and most people were there after my rank\n        │   └── In round 2 are you planning on upgrading to aiml, or have you decided on cs in ec campus\n        │       └── AI ML is too risky bro..New batch from this year..\n        └── Hey, have you recieved any official confirmation or email post selection?\n            └── A little too late but yeah I've got it. I attended the offline counselling though"

Now I'm paranoid and sort of freaking out since there isn't any written confirmation and I have NO other options anywhere else this year. \n\n(The person doing the counselling *did* say the seat is confirmed like she did to everyone who selected a seat, and I've taken an ss of my name under the 'seat selection completed')\n└── Chill bro you made it👍"
