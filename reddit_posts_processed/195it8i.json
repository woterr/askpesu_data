But given that first year is arguably the easiest year, you really need to pull up your socks dude. First year builds the foundation for your GPA in later years.\n└── The paper was tough not so easy bro\n    └── Papers are rarely that straightforward here. You can't study overnight and expect good grades at PES. The people you see with a 9+ CGPA are ones who focus on consistency as well as hard work. Semesters get gradually more difficult as you progress, your workload also increases and other commitments beyond the curriculum also come into existence. These grades now are the easiest you'll ever be able to score, make most of the time now."
