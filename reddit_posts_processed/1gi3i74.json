So many of my frnds got good internships and didn't get converted. Same thing happened to me. But a guaranteed job is the best option imo unless you're really sure you'll get a t1 internship and get converted. The market still hasn't gone back to normal so I'd suggest taking the fte when you have the chance. Getting hired as a fresher outside of placements is pretty hard, especially now\n        └── Thank you"
