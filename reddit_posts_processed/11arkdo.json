Only after 1st year they shuffle once and remain that way until you graduate\n├── Yea but for our batch the kcet students joined 2-3 months late due to some issues. Hence they've been in a separate fast paced batch for the entire sem. And they're gonna be merged now.\n│   ├── won't matter lol. they'll be in a separate class, but study alongside us.\n│   └── Yes, but even they gave the ESAs with you right? Coming next semester they'll be in their class only and start the semester with you\n├── They did shuffle second sem last year, but not much, mostly to segregate branches.\n└── They DID shuffle, rowlet-senpai..\n    └── Yeah looks like some new thing nowadays"
