I was comfortable with Units 1 and 2 since the tb was nice, but Iâ€™m finding 3 and 4 quite overwhelming because thereâ€™s a lot of content and some concepts are hard to grasp\n\nWe also have a lab quiz that accounts for 8 marks overall ",

No way out\n    â””â”€â”€ CS is not programming. It never was.\n        â””â”€â”€ im disappointed I didnt know this earlier\n            â””â”€â”€ CS is about solving problems using machines. Programming is just one of the many means to implement a solution. The real CS is theoretical CS.\n                â””â”€â”€ ah well I have studied some networking in 12th grade and I can say that I hated it...  \ntheoretical CS ðŸ˜­"
