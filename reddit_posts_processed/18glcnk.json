Would like to know from seniors (or fellow batchmates who have already completed their chem lab exam) about how strict will the exam be, the viva and stuff. Also, are we supposed to mug up procedure and all?\n\nTIA.",

Viva depends on teachers mostly.\nâ””â”€â”€ We have VBS for lab(and theory also)ðŸ¥²\n    â””â”€â”€ wait, what is VBS? lol i don't know, didn't have it ig (or maybe I am becoming old f)"

For python and c i can understand that lab exams are kinds important and they do make sense but bruh phy and chem lab exams are just so messed up\n    â””â”€â”€ Not only for you sem1 kids, but even sem3 assignments are also just worsening, loads of shit for petty marks, fr we are evolving backward yet again f\n        â””â”€â”€ I'm in sem 3 only, True about that."

Don't worry too much. I gave a blank paper and got A. Nobody takes first year exams seriously and definitely not the labs"
