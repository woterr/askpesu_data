From all i knke Jee admissions are kinda fluctuating and depends on how many kids apply through the jee main quota. \nIf I remember  a guy here told me last year he had 92%tile and got cse in rr campus. But the fees is really high this year (4L~)\n    â””â”€â”€ So it'll be worth applying right? I'm writing pessat as well. Also fees is not an issue\n        â””â”€â”€ I mean , no problem in applying no? I'd say you might get in , worth a shot \nAnd with 95%tile imo you'll definitely get EC campus cs so try for RR campus first."
