I'm curious how many go on to pursue a Master's degree in Computer Science from top USA universities.\n\nI heard the intake is about 2.5k cse students both campuses included and Can anyone provide insights on how many PES College alumni actually end up in top USA universities (e.g.. Stanford, MIT, Berkeley. Carnegie Mellon) for their MS in CS?\n\nHow good is pes ec campus specifically since most of the posts are regarding rr campus and which nit  can I leave and join pes ec. \n\nAll remaining questions have been covered in the FAQS and thanks for that💚\n\n\n\n",

      "body": "> I'm curious how many go on to pursue a Master's degree in Computer Science from top USA universities.\n\nMany. PES has a large alumni base at almost every top uni in the States. You'll especially find large groups of PES students at places like CMU, UCLA, UCSD, NYU to name a few. Everyone's also in touch with each other, there's a pretty big alumni server comprising students pursuing/pursued their MS and it's pretty active. If you want to find how many studied in a particular uni, get on LinkedIn and search using the University name along with PES. You'll find a very long list. And this is only CS. Once you start accounting for allied programs like Data Science, CE, etc, the list will expand. \n\n>MIT, Berkeley.\n\nThese two don't have a standard MS program. Their MS program if present is an undergrad feeder program. So you'll find less than a handful of students from India here.\n└── First of all thanks for the FAQS they were really helpful and cleared most of my doubts.  It's good to hear that pes has so many alumni in top unis. I might leave NITK and join pes ec as my main aim is to go for masters. So why spend 12L for the same degree when I can get it for 3-4l and still go for top colleges.\n    └── That decision is yours to make. However, given the same/similar branch across both colleges, I'd pick the more reputed one. A more recognised college in India can elevate how your undergrad GPA is seen. For example, an 8.0 from PES is not equivalent to an 8.0 from IIT; you can google the UCI GPA converter as a sample converter that all UCs use. Additionally, the more important differentiator is that better ranked colleges in India also have better labs and provide access to more opportunities to build your profile for MS. They will have more recognised and reputed profs, a higher quality of research labs and opportunities, access to better resources, etc, all of which help their students to stand out. \n\nIt's definitely not impossible to get such opportunities from colleges like PES - the large alumni base every year is proof of this - it's just that you will have lesser opportunities to do so and you'll have to put in significantly more efforts to find the same opportunities which your IITian counterparts might have access to.\n        └── Do other good foreign colleges also use these type of cgpa convertors or do only UCs use them? Got to know about these from you for the first time, want to know more about them!\n            └── All unis have their own internal converters to convert GPA from any university to their scale. UC Irvine is the only school I know of that has a public converter, otherwise most unis keep it private.\n                └── Oh , thanks for the insights."

      "body": "Which course in NITK? If it's not CS and you're interested in CSE, only then give PES a serious thought.\n└── I have 99.74% in the Jan jee attempt. I can get any nit cse but I can't afford fees. Pes ec cse through kcet is cheap and close to my home and the additional scholarship that they provide makes it even cheaper. My main aim is to pursue mscs from abroad and I think joining pes will help since many people have made it to cmu and other top colleges. So why spend 12L for the same btech from NITK.\n    ├── I see. I would ideally prefer NITK CSE. The NIT tag is one that will stay with you your entire life. Along with this, I'm sure the opportunities and facilities there will be much better. \n\nHowever, I can understand your reasoning behind PESU EC CSE. Living with your parents and the college being close to home(along with being cheap) can make a huge difference to your quality of life and peace of mind and within Bengaluru, it's a well-reputed college. If you want to go for PES EC CSE, you'll need to work very, very hard for the same opportunities that an NIT might provide you though, but if you're able to do well in JEE, you should be able to thrive there too. PS: PESU RR is also feasible for you if you're getting it, it's not too far if you take NICE Road.\n    │   └── Thanks for commenting. College being close and cheap are huge factors for me to join this college. I simply don't see a reason to pay 12l for the same degree at NITK.  Do you know how many actually end up going for top unis abroad. How does pes have cse avg of 17lpa while even few tier 1 nits like NIT CALICUT  don't have that kind of avgs??\n    │       └── No way does PES have 17lpa avg for CSE\n    │           ├── My bad it's actually 12lpa🥲💚. Which is still pretty good.\n    │           └── Averages can be skewed, especially because of the number of folks who joined IBM this year. Median is better.\n    │               └── according to nirf's data the median a few years back was 12lpa. Do u have any reliable sources for the average or more recent medians??? Because i dint find it on the website\n    │                   ├── There's a 2025 placements sheet but it hasn't been updated in a while.\n    │                   └── The exel sheet maintained by students says the median is 12 too\n    └── Brother take a loan \n12L is not a lot for someone who will graduate from NITk. \nBro pes grads itself endup earning 40-50 lakhs after a good amount of work experience, imagine how far NITk grads go, in the long run this money will be a blip for u. \nThe thing is 10 yrs from now u should not regret that u should have went to NITk instead of pes.\n        └── Reality ain't that great in NIT either but I do agree.If you're getting NIT K CSE, this shouldn't be a question at all."

The peer group, placements, teachers will all be better. There is no comparing PES and NITK. I wouldn't drop a whole league just to attend something thats nearby. In the grand scheme of things you could say it doesn't matter, but this will affect your quality of life for the next 4 years. You can always get an apartment if you don't want to stay in a pg or the hostel."
