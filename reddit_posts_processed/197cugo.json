During chem Esa, i ran out of sheets so i typed the last two question but didn't bubble the ques no in answer booklet as I didnt have any more pages left. During python esa, we had typed most of the answers but the invigilator had specifically told us to bubble the question as well in booklet which we are typing. Now I am confused whether they would check my typed answer or not?\n    â””â”€â”€ If you have typed out the answer then you do not need to bubble the booklet. You can technically write all the answers by typing without even touching the answer booklet\n        â””â”€â”€ okay ty"

I didn't even touch the booklet\nâ””â”€â”€ Idt Iâ€™m gonna touch the booklet in my python exam Tom as well thatâ€™s why I asked\n    â””â”€â”€ Most are intuitive but there were few codes that are hard to understand. Mug them up. Remember all patterns and syntaxes. And learn the sort of questions they asked in isas. They will ask questions divided into small one mark questions like you got in isas. Learn how to do those well\n        â””â”€â”€ thanks sm!\n            â””â”€â”€ I was so pissed that day. Many questions were exactly the same as the ones in isa. Learn from me get S grade ðŸ˜‚"
