      "body": "Theyre prolly the most unpredictable bunch of interviewers ive ever seen. It all depends on who you get. They might ask you every question of every single subject youâ€™ve ever come across in your entire degree or might ask you whatâ€™s polymorphism and wrap it up for the day and proceed you to the next round. You might even get interviewed for an hour straight and not make it to the next round or can clear the round by just answering whatâ€™s polymorphism. It depends on your luck atp."
