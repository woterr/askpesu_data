Also, can PES be considered the 4th best college in Bangalore? How are the placements and the general crowd there? I messed up KCET and don’t have much hope from COMEDK either, so just wondering if this would be my best bet. Also I won’t be taking the hostel so should I book the seat?",

How dare you, we're literally the IIT of Bangalore\n├── It's campus is just like stanford fr\n└── wait are you being fr. would it be ranked after rvce or like after msrit and bms cuz i heard the crowd in pes is much better than msrit or bms so i wanted to join pes\n    └── Im myself going thru this exact phase of urs, the campus esp the library of RR no doubt feels straight out of harvard or a foreign uni, \n\nBut looking at so many comments regarding its strictness is the only obstacle thats coming btwn me making a decision for PESU."
