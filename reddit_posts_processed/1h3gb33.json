In CS its relatively easy. 3rd year will be hell though because you will have capstone and a bunch of pretty hard subjects (in CS at least). It's not impossible, but not easy either.\n└── Thanksss"

Additionally, along with an increase in course difficulty, there is an increase in courseload with more assignments, labs, deliverables, and in general, the effort needed per course to obtain a high grade. Arguably, although the courses in first year are irrelevant, they are the lightest because there aren't many deliverables from assignments and projects, unlike higher semesters where every course has multiple of these. Plus, there is the added extra work from other commitments that creep into your life: exploring and upskilling, finding your interests, looking for internships, placement prep, capstone (depending on which year you are going to) etc etc\n└── Thanks a lot"
