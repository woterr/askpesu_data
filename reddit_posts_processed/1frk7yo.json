Plus using such a large reference book as secondary to slides is not good idea. Is it advisable to buy 2nd hand VTU  T.B for reference so that it becomes easier? ",

Why would you follow the VTU syllabus if you're at PES? \n\n> Plus using such a large reference book(hard/soft copy both) as secondary to slides is not good idea.\n\nCare to explain?\n└── Ohh kk. Yea  got it\n    └── You'll find the sections that are picked from these textbooks in the lesson plan document. You can ask your teacher for this. It details which topic is from which textbook, and which section (page numbers or section numbers) \n\nYou only have to study that, not the entire book"

Or are you going to work?\n\nSkill matters, the rest can always be managed!"
