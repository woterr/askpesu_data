  "content": "Hello everyone, I am in need of arduino ans sensors, i have talked to few senions who told to go to SP road and there you will get the parts for really cheap. I did do there this week-end but it was crossing my budget(at the start i want to explore the domain of robotics, then invest if i like it), If anyone wants to sell these parts do let me know. Thank-you.  \n\n\nThings i need, arduino, Sensors, jumping cables, breadboard, motors, and anything u have related to this domain. ",
