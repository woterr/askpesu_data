You'll have to contact admissions office\nâ””â”€â”€ Any minimum 12th percentage requirement.\n    â””â”€â”€ Hm it also depends on your performance in pessat also apparently ,  but as long as you rich you can do anything to be fair but people say 80%\n        â””â”€â”€ I have 69% in 12th ðŸ¤¡ and 66xx rank in pessat. And comedk rank is 36xxx .  I am looking for EEE branch\n            â””â”€â”€ Try for rvce eee maybe? Contact their office ik pepp who joined recently however fees might be steep and probably bms and MSR also cus usually lower branches don't get filled fast under management and many will surrender their seats also.\n\nAlso I think 69% is difficult to get into pes mqðŸ’€ cus people say that since they want to keep a good reputation they ask for minimum 80%\n                â”œâ”€â”€ Rvce and msrit\n                â””â”€â”€ Should I join bit or dsce BMSIT EEE THROUGH COMEDK  if u can plz name other good college in blr\n                    â”œâ”€â”€ Honestly go for colleges like BMS , RV , MSR for eee some other decent colleges \"in my opinion\" jss and nie\n                    â””â”€â”€ bmsit is worst college\n                        â””â”€â”€ I am talking about BMSCE"
