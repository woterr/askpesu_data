End it there. No need to fight a war cause some kid 4 years younger isn't serious about life.\n\nu/Particular_Alps9053 , you literally have no reason to get involved here. Don't like grads handing out the harsh truth? Leave the sub. We aren't holding you captive. Absolute peak joblessness to spark a comment war.\n\nu/LankyAd6265 , get serious about your life and career, whether its in engineering or otherwise. Figure out what you want to do, head to career counseling, do whatever you need. But spewing toxic comments at each other does not help one bit. You're supposed to be an adult - act like one. Be mature, grow a spine, show some fucking accountability and sort your life out."
