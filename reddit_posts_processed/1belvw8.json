Honestly, achieving 97.2 percent seems respectable, but the truth is I'll likely only secure admission for civil engineering at NITK. Many say it's a good percentile, but only some of em know the actual reality, true achievement seems to come only with a 99.5+ percentile.\"\n                                â”œâ”€â”€ That's the reality of jee mains for general category students.. That too comapared to banglore top 4 colleges only top 8 nits cse is better that hardly some ppl know, what matters for everyone is nit tag... Already taking science was out of my interest for the puspose of tag I dont want to neglect my Intrest towards cse. \n\nEven pes cse cutoff is around 98 that's the reality\n                                â”‚   â””â”€â”€ I will be getting pesu ecc cse afaik, but the fees are out of my aukaat....\n                                â””â”€â”€ Yup truee \nRVCE has better placement stats than the NIT and IIIT's you will get at 97.2. Or even 98.5\n                                    â”œâ”€â”€ True, idk why people downvoted me in this sub, when I said the same thing last timeðŸ˜“\n                                    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Ig because of the tag ??

Getting into NITK ECE would still be my primary goal but I can't do anything if jee messes up 2nd attempt as well\n                                        â””â”€â”€ But 97 percentile means 42k rank near that (is 14 lakh people sit ) how come you are getting NITK ece ?\n                                            â””â”€â”€ He might be saying, he will try to clear the cutoff for nitk ece in the 2nd attempt.."

      "body": ">If possible can u give me a comparison between msrit n pes.\n\nThis [comment ](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/13ygg68/comment/jmmro6e)highlights a review about PES. You will need to ask someone from MSRIT for an accurate review.\n\n>Please give some tricks to Crack pessat ( like which day to attend exam, comparatively which shit would be easier n all)\n\nIts KCET level, or a bit higher. Ideally, does not require additional prep. As for which shift and other hacks, there is no way to predict. Its best to focus on the exam and prepare rather than focusing on the hacks.\n\n>If you have any contacts to get me a seat in pes please please text me. I would be really happy\n\nI would not recommend joining via management quota. Its too expensive and does not justify the fees you pay. There are multiple posts on this subreddit that highlight why, just search and you will find.\nâ””â”€â”€ The seats have doubled with total intake being 2200 for Cse +cse (AIML)do you think the college will make efforts to place those many students?? Or it will. Be like VIT SRM\n    â””â”€â”€ >do you think the college will make efforts to place those many students\n\nThe very first thing that should be clear is that the college *does not owe you* a job at the end of your 4 years. They will try to bring in companies as they usually do, but the companies that actually visit and the number of students selected are completely up to the company and the job market at that time. Placement season is usually very competitive and with each company taking in a handful at most, it can get very stressful. Every year, it gets exponentially tougher and the number of unplaced students will also increase. This is true at every college, not just PES.\n        â””â”€â”€ So then even after spending 20 lakhs we cannot expect even a job.Then it is useless.\n            â”œâ”€â”€ Bruh.. Forgot the hostel fees? It will be costing you around 25-28 lakhs, if u take admission via pessat\n\nIt's even more through mgmt quota, the mgmt fees is 11lpa afaik...\n            â””â”€â”€ No University in this country will owe you a job at the end of your degree. It's up to you to build your skill set and profile and be industry ready. The University is just a platform to bring opportunities to you. You need to make the most of what's given. You'll be in college soon - you'll realise spoon enough that in life nothing is spoon fed to you. A 100% placement rate is at best, falsified data, atleast in the current job market and competitive situation.\n                â””â”€â”€ Then it useless to spend 25 lakhs on this clg if cannot return even a single penny back.There is difference between t-3 and t-1 iit cse\n                    â””â”€â”€ I'm not saying there is no difference between T3 and T1 colleges. There is a huge difference. Please read my comment again. The number and quality of opportunities are obviously far better at IIT/NIT/BITS/NIT.  Nobidy is denying that. \n\nBut the harsh truth is, regardless of which college you're in, *you* will need to put in the effort to get placed and have skills that the industry needs. No company will just pick you up looking at your college. Look at placement stats at most top colleges this year and see the number of unplaced students - even IITs this year have unplaced students still looking for jobs. At the end of the day, if you aren't industry-ready, nobody will recruit you. It's upto you if you want to live in a bubble that a BTech automatically guarantees you a job.\n                        â””â”€â”€ Many companies like tower research allow only top iit cs students.I think pes has more unplaced students.About 300 students were not eligible for placement and another 200 did not get placed.This is extremely bothering.Also in iits you would pay about 11lakhs including all fees.For pesu it is 25 lakhs.Top IIT has tag pes does not. Please answer these question\n                            â””â”€â”€ Again, you're raising points which I never argued with. Not sure what you're trying to prove here, since I never said that PES is better than any T1 college from any angle.\n                                â””â”€â”€ So basically pes is last resort for student.There is nothing lower than it.\n                                    â””â”€â”€ There are arguably a lot of worse colleges ofc. PES is still considered to be in the top 5 in Bangalore and one of the top colleges in the state. But yeah, there are also better T2/T3 colleges like RV and Manipal which have better opportunities overall.\n                                        â””â”€â”€ \"Money\"pal pes are all money Whores. 25-30lakhs no placement big middle finger for 4 yrs.I have nothing that's why I have join these types of kalej for cs\n                                            â””â”€â”€ My guy even some people in IIT's are unplaced. College would only provide with you the necessary skills. Why would the college provide you with a job if you refuse to work hard?"

Just know what you're signing up for. Don't keep unrealistic expectations of some chill college life. If you're joining PES the academics will be rigorous. Try not to get backlogs and just maintain good relations with your faculty and you're good to go. People that hate on this college have no valid reasons to do so (apart from the management, they suck lol). The faculty is full of young people that are more than eager to help you. You guys have no idea how ahead PES in terms of curriculum and labs as compared to other colleges in Bangalore. If you're coming here, just know you'll be expected to work hard academically. If that's not what you want, don't come here. As simple as that.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ What is the safe CGPA for placement?\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Realistically keep it above 8.5 for being eligible for 99% of the companies. But anything above 7.75 should be fine for 80% of the companies. This might change for your batch tho.\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ Thanks!\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Thanks for the genuine answer\nâ””â”€â”€ On an average PES is pretty shit\n    â””â”€â”€ Tbh every college is shit to its students\n\nPesu is shit in some things but really good in others, it's just the tradeoff everywhere not just pesu"
