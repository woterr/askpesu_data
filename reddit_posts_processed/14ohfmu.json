Its good for people who are just looking for a degree for teaching jobs or to do phd. oly few people out of 60 got internship . we didnt even get one proper campus placement for full time. There is oly one section for Mtech which the college somehow wants to fill each year so that mtech doesnt get cancelled . Placement officer lies to ur face giving false promises to juniors saying join mtech everyone is getting placed.   \nSemesters are too short u will spend most of the time writing reports instead of actual learning .   \nFaculty is also average"
