      "body": "One company called Consecure came for placements for our batch, hiring for SDE - Cybersecurity role.   \nTalking about web dev, most of the SDEs in India are web devs, so naturally companies hire for SDEs which are basically web dev jobs\n\nSpecific web dev jobs a few of them have come though, like SDE1 - backend (for Licious company)\n\nWebdev is kinda saturated, I would say try cybersec, AIML or other trending domains\n\nGood luck\n├── >One company called Consecure came for placements for our batch, hiring for SDE - Cybersecurity role.\n\n>Webdev is kinda saturated, I would say try cybersec\n\nSorry but do u mean that I have to try off campus/masters or smtng? Please elaborate\n│   └── By saturated I meant, you cud try web dev, its not *dead*, its just that, companies hiring via placements for this domain specific role are quite less. You can aim for placements safely, not a problem. \n\nSearch on r/developersIndia  you will find numerous posts about this!!  \n\n\nGood luck!!\n│       └── Sorry for the misconception but I was talking about cybersecurity in the previous comment.How are we gonna proceed with it after our bachelor's degree\n│           └── Um, I am not sure. DM me if you want to talk to someone who is into Cybersecurity. I know only a few people\n└── How would I start off preparing for cybersec?\n    ├── I am into AIML. I am not sure how to answer that\n    │   ├── Oh cool! I am actually studying in cse(ai&ml) in ec campus, would love to know more about AIML. Dm?\n    │   │   └── Sure\n    │   └── Hi can I dm?\n    │       └── Sure\n    │           ├── Sure\n    │           └── Sure\n    └── Start CTFs , THM/HTB rooms \nLearn the theory -\nOwasp , mittre framework.\nChoose blue or red team\nAnd grind :)\n        └── Thank you so much!"

      "body": "A couple of companies came for cysec AFAIK, not a lot. A few companies are coming for pure web dev, but from what I see most want good backend devs, they didn't specially mention knowing frontend sometimes but heavily focused on backend stuff\n└── Did u do your expertise in cybersecurity or do uk anyone who has done that with whom I can connect through any social media?\n    └── nope, I'm in aiml. dm if you wanna contact someone in cysec"

      "body": "I think it is a good idea to learn cybersecurity well. My specializations were all over the place, but many companies require some cybersecurity skills. I think Deloitte(tier 2) hired 10 people for a cybersecurity related role, but cybersecurity-related questions are asked in a lot of places ( Accenture MCQs, Amazon Cloud support associate, etc.)\n└── Ohh thanks\n\nBut I was planning to completely shift to cybersecurity but seeing the placement sheet I'm not really sure,the intake is less, companies are less and even the pay is less"
