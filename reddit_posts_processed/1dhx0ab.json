So since ur getting pes ec through cet I'd say go for it 100%.\nâ””â”€â”€ what about manipal tho, I'm confused about it\n    â””â”€â”€ \n\nOverall in terms of placements and everything Manipal and PES are more or less the same. Manipal does have more of a campus life if that's important to you. You can still have a lot of fun at pes I feel since it's all down to friend group\n\nAND ofc fees. It depends on how big a factor fees is for you. If you're okay with 5L, then Manipal and PES RR come back into the picture. \n\nThere are some v descriptive answers regarding manipal vs pes in this subreddit which you should go through.\n        â””â”€â”€ no actually my parents are hesitant for manipal because of the drug culture\n            â””â”€â”€ My parents too but i talked to some seniors and they say it's bs. If u wanted to u can and will get yourself into substance abuse anywhere.\n                â””â”€â”€ Really? The people I talked to remarked that drugs are rampant in the college and I  know some  people afflicted by this drug menace\n                    â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ’€ what\n                    â””â”€â”€ my man drugs r in every college u go to... u just gotta choose whom to hang out with"

If you feel 5lakhs is too high, pes ec campus is better.The only thing you will missout by choosing ec campus is college life\nâ””â”€â”€ but like placements wise only, I don't mind college life\n(and parents are hesitant for manipal because of the drug culture there)\n    â””â”€â”€ placements wise both are equal, but you will have tougher competition in pes due to large amount of people\n        â””â”€â”€ Tbh even Manipal main is no better now because it too has multiple CS-allied branches - CS, CS+AIML, CS+DS, DS, IT, CCE etc. Plus last time I heard, the BLR campus will have pooled placements with main campus. I don't think the \"lower batch strength\" argument will apply when OP will reach final year.\n            â””â”€â”€ there are close to 2k students in cs and cs-branches in pes( both branches), thats a lot"
