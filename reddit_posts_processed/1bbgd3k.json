In the evenings and also no proper ventilation so feels a lil suffocated again during peak hours. \nI joined this gym only bcz, my clg gym membership expired during my 7th sem. Since i was stay in the clg only for another 6 months, a full year subscription ws unnecessary for me. And there was no half yearly membership in the clg gym. Otherwise,  clg gym anyday. Better in everyway, only prblm cud be that it is restricted for 1hr 15 mins batches for everyday"
