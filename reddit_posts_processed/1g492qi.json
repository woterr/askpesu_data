  "content": "So, for the past week, I've noticed something mind-blowing on my commute to the Electronic City campus‚Äîbuses stopping right at the college entrance. I‚Äôm talking precision-level bus halts. Like, ‚ÄúAm I in a VIP zone?‚Äù type of situation.\n\nBut wait, it gets crazier. Today, I heard the bus speaker and saw the board actually announce PES College as a stop! Right after Hosa Road Junction! üò±\n\nI mean‚Ä¶ can this be real life? Has PES reached \"official bus stop\" status now? If so, forget being IIT Bangalore; we‚Äôre CalTech Bangalore branch!",
