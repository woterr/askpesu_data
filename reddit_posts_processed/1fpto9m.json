Yes, the dsa helps with \\_getting\\_ a job, but knowing how to think, and reason about a problem is just as important, if not more so.\n\nTLDR: don't treat this like JEE Prep, learn to love programming for the joy of it.\n└── is 1st sem python and 2nd sem c enough for starting off w dsa?\n    └── Start dsa with C. So learn proper C first\n        └── from where do I learn c?is what they teach in college enough?"
