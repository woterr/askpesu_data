Study well, make new friends and roam around responsibly. Don't be all worried about your future right from day 1. Internships are important I agree but a low gpa always creates a bad impression among recruiters even if your resume is stellar cuz your gpa is the first line of filtering for on-campus placements, and applying off campus is just as bad if not worse"
