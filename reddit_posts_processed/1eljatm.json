      "body": "Finding any subject \"easiest\" is very subjective.  \nDSA - Coding (in C) + Algorithms. Engaging and challenging sometimes.  \nDAA - Algorithms and its psuedo codes. Easy mostly except for some concepts at the end of the course.  \nOS - Theoretical subject and the syllabus was huge so not anywhere around the \"easiest\" category.  \nDBMS - I am in 5th sem but I think the subject is very engaging and practical. Idk about the difficulty."
