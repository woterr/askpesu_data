But taking a drop is your decision and I would recommend to not ask other people or on social media whether or not you should take a drop year.\n\nI am able to think from your perspective because I was in the same situation as you till I got CSE in PESU this year through PESSAT ( I flunked in JEE and COMEDK) (Thanks to PESSAT slot booking facility)"

      "body": "Changing of branches is a very optimistic scenario and is highly unlikely. Your seat can only be upgraded from EEE to CSE, if there are empty seats in CSE (this itself being highly unlikely), and if you do manage to find a few empty seats, you need to be at the absolute top of your entire branch (across both campuses) to upgrade. \n\nI obviously do not know you so I am not going to comment on your ability to do it, but based on previous trends, usually only 2-3 seats open up in every branch after the 1st year."
