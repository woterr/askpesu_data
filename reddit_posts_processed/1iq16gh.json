I don't know if it's the same condition in other colleges, maybe someone from another college can comment on this. \n\nThis situation arises because PES has a shortage of teachers, especially for the lower semester subjects. The management allots subjects and the teacher's preference for subjects are given less importance than they should be given. You end up with teachers teaching subjects they are not interested in. They might be interested, and actually good at teaching some other subject. \n\nAs for the academic workload, yep it's high. The syllabus here is more advance when compared to other colleges. Teachers and Alumni regularly mention this, and maybe u/rowlet-owl can comment on it. It is more demanding than other colleges but it isn't like you'd get 0 time for hobbies. There are many clubs here, with their fare share of drama apart from the technical stuff they do."

I remember a suicide happening while I was in class—the person fell right beside my classroom. These assholes closed the curtains and carried on like nothing had happened. continued classes as if it were just another day. I was in so much shock I could barely sleep for days, and seniors had their exams there the very next morning. \n\nSo yeah, PES is good, great even for placements and peer connections, but when it comes to everything else it's absolute shit.\n├── Bro tf,they just... closed the curtains.

      "body": "So I graduated in 2022 (seems like forever ago now lol) and here are my 2 cents: \n\nSuicides can happen anywhere. However if you do want to compare numbers, PES has had significantly fewer (totally 3-4 in history) compared to other colleges, including T1 ones. While the academic pressure is indeed high, it's often a mix of reasons that lead people to take the final step. Students have joined and also graduated with far more academic pressure than what exists today, so blaming *only* the pressure isn't valid. The real problem lies in how PES handles these events and that's why in recent years there's been a steady decrease in its reputation among students. Someone else spoke about this so I won't iterate these points again. \n\nObjectively speaking, sure PES is great: for the tier it belongs to, it secures solid and good placements every year (18LPA average if in CS) and it didn't suffer during COVID years too. It has a pretty updated syllabus and has good infrastructure too. The crowd is too notch and you'll find alumni either working at top MNCs including FAANG or studying at top places for MS/PhD like CMU/UCLA/UCSD/NYU. When it comes to the BLR colleges, PES is definitely one of the top options, usually considered 1st/2nd. \n\nHowever, every place has its problems. There are far too many problems at PES today from a shitshow management to poor faculty. Management struggles to take well informed decisions that benefit everyone and most profs here aren't really interested in what they're teaching, and if they are, they aren't equipped to teach well at an UG level. Research labs are in a sorry state and most research published from PES are at predatory venues. The academic rigor is extremely high - you will need to grind and actually put in a large amount of effort to score a satisfactory grade. Given the number of students here, GPA is used as a filter for many things so having q high GPA is crucial. Academics usually takes up 80% of your time here. \n\nGenerally speaking, you could get similar benefits at other colleges, with a fewer disadvantages. PES is very expensive, especially if you aren't from CET. You could get the same advantage by paying significantly lesser at other colleges. So is PES is a good option? Yeah definitely. Metrics wise, it's great. If you want a good job after BTech, PES will do that. But it's nothing more."

Definitely worth joining pesu over bms or rmsit. \nThe PPL on this sub are mostly losers who joined pes even after knowing its a slightly rigorous college and then complaining about it. \nTldr: for colleges in BLR for cse try for RVCE, if u don't get it join PESU."
