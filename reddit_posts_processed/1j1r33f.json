CS has many electives but aiml will have only 3 (iirc) and one of them is the same as cse one(I think it was cybersecurity, but I've forgotten, someone correct me).\n├── does someone have the list of electives for cse and aiml?\n│   └── Search through this subreddit, you'll find someone having posted it. You can also ask on discord.\n└── 🤓☝️"
