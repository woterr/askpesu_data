Each prof is assigned a set of questions and they have to correct all answers for those questions to ensure standardisation in marks. But then again PES isn't really transparent with these things."

If strength is low same prof will grade, otherwise it is done using that system (where all profs teaching the subject will mark certain questions assigned to them). But you can't message up in the earlier method either cause they won't know ur name. "
