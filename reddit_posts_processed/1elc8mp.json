If someone asks for the group, either ask for their number and ask an admin to add it (recommended) or share the link directly over DM. \n\nThe group link is already public somewhere because American numbers have been joining it every other week lol\nâ”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Can you send me the invite link pls\nâ”‚       â”‚       â””â”€â”€ DM the original commenter, I don't have it.\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ Hey, can you send me the invite link?\nâ””â”€â”€ Bro send me the WhatsApp invite link"
