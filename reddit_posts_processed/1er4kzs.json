They're your backlogs for a reason...They can't suddenly expect you to learn new stuff if you haven't attended the classes. And if the syllabus changes for the students after you, you won't have access to that syllabus since you enrolled before the change in syllabus.\n└── This is actually a pretty interesting question though, its an edge case nobody would have thought of. Did you check if the syllabus changed for any of your backlogs (which you attempted after a year)? Because if you clear it in the summer then the syllabus does not change.\n    └── There wasn't anything new or unknown for any backlog."
