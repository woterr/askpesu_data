Click on bus option in Google maps after giving origin and destination and it will show the possible routes and bus numbers.\n└── Yes, it'll show the route numbers, but I want the destinations. For example, I'm sure Yeshwantpur bus goes to PES. What other ones??\n    └── Vijayanagara(mf12)\nKengeri(501series only)\nHebbal\nYeshwantpur (410 series)\n        └── Thanks a lot!\n\nEdit: here, have an award"
