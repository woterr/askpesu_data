Regardless, May will be extremely hectic - you will either have ESAs or you will have lab exams and assignment/project submissions.\n├── 2nd sem starts 10th feb\n│   ├── Then it probably won't overlap with ESAs but it's going to be one stressful month\n│   └── For those downvoting, go check the calendar outside your classes 🙌🏻 \n(Freshers)\n└── What lab exams?\n    └── Exams for your lab components of different courses. If you're in first year, you'll have lab exams for Python/C and Physics/Chem."
