(CSE)\n│           └── Yes. There are about 900-ish CSE kids across both campuses.\n│               └── Bro one thing. These placement stats are of 2018-2022 batch or 2019-2023 batch cuz placements happen at the end of 3rd year right.\n│                   └── 2018-2022. Placements have concluded for us. \n\n2019-2023 placements have barely started. There are no stats available for them.\n│                       └── No actually 2019-2023 batch's  placements are done(3rd year ended). Some guy from that batch has also posted on this sub about his placements. So I am still confused about which batch's placement stats are these!\n│                           └── No, their placements have just begun. Placements go on for Ane entire year. Yes, about 3-4 companies have visited and come have gotten PPOs from their summer internship as well. \nPlacements start in the last week of July in your final year, and go on all the way till June end. So if you graduate in 2022, your placements begin in July 2021 and end in June 2022. For the 2023 batch, their placements started 2 weeks ago and will end only in June 2023.\n│                               └── Ok so these are final placement stats of 2018-2022 batch then! Thank you bro , I've saved your comment for inferring further👍👍👌\n└── How many of these are from ec campus cse. Like I saw the 2021 data somewhere where tier 1 offers for rr campus were about 190 and for ec just about 15\n    └── Maybe EC campus seniors can shed some light on the situation."
