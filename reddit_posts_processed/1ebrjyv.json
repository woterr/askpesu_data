      "body": "There is a detailed CS vs CS-AIML comparison in the FAQs: https://bit.ly/pesu-faq\n\nTLDR: CS is a better option because it gives you the flexibility to choose based on your interest and doesn't restrict you to a domain, plus, it's a more recognised branch choice from a higher education point of view. If your goal is only to get a good job however, then CS-AIML placements will be the same as CS placements."
