It marked many answers wrong when they were correct. Showed it to maam too. She said this time AI messed up things and there was too much work from their perspective too.\n\nAbout the marks, nothing's changed so far.\n    └── So sick\nAtleast they have manually review the answers to confirm whether AI has given correct answers\n        └── What's the point of AI then\n            └── Yea but when its not at all accurate,\nHow do we completely trust AI based scores is my point"
