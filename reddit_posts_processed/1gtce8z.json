If you want an A grade, you can scale each component and see how much you need in the respective components. There is no \"how much\" because it depends on how you score in each component.\n    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Hi rowlett Im aiml 3rd sem and I need to buy a new laptop.Should I go for a mac or a gaming laptop?Im looking at lenovo legion which has a 4070\n    â””â”€â”€ don't worry about something that hasn't arrived yet. Just try your best for isa 1 and tackle one thing at a time. If lack of preparation was the cause then you already know what you should do to make up for it next time :)\n\nall the best!!!"
