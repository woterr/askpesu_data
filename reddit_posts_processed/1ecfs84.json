      "body": "Pes ec campus> bms > jss ( if you are more academically inclined and care about placements ) \nBms > pes ec > jss ( if you want relatively easier academics) \nSince bms increased seats it will be interesting to see their placement statistics , pes is already proven with that number of seats and gives a good ROI , rest choice is yours..\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Ohh thank you broo ðŸ˜„\nâ”œâ”€â”€ I also might get re campus cse with aiml specialization, as it is a new branch introduced, will it be risky for me to go as I heard first batch of any new course is always riskyÂ \nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ See , although the syllabus remains same upto 70-75% , choosing CSE - AI ML will include lot of maths. Core CSE will always give you the flexibility to be relevant in AI ML or AI DS or any other specialization field so better to choose core CSE..\nâ””â”€â”€ Late question but is pes ec academically lenient than jss?\n    â”œâ”€â”€ Nope mate , both RR and EC campus follow similar circulum, there is no way for you to feel it's more lenient that jss ( jss being affiliated to VTU) .\n    â””â”€â”€ Nope mate , both RR and EC campus follow similar circulum, there is no way for you to feel it's more lenient that jss\n        â””â”€â”€ Got confused cuz u ranked bms>pes ec> jss for easier academics.\n            â””â”€â”€ My bad . BMS > JSS > PES EC/RR ( in terms of easy scoring of CGPA ) rest follows same.\n                â”œâ”€â”€ Thanks for clarification.\n                â””â”€â”€ Hey , so will it be a right decision if I choose pes ec campus over jss ( by keeping placements as my first priority)?? . I am late but please answer\n                    â””â”€â”€ Definately, go for it as placements are pooled for EC and RR campus .. and if you maintain a good CGPA , a T1 placement would be easy thing.\n                        â””â”€â”€ Thanks a lot . Like How much CGPA is a good CGPA tho?\n                            â””â”€â”€ 8.5+ across all sems.\n                                â””â”€â”€ Okay"
