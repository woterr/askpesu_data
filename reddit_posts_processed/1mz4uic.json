Why?\n                    └── Don't know man, like generally september and October are the peek of placements; But the number of companies is not even one per day, it was 1-2 per day during last academic year I guess.\n                        └── That is honestly soo depressing 😭\n                            └── Yeah, with this market getting an offer campus is much more difficult; We are totally cooked at this point\n                                └── How many have gotten placed so far?\n                                    └── Around 108 have got placed through the drives and I guess at least 30-40 have got ppo; So it must be around 150.\n                                        ├── 😢\n                                        └── Ngl, isn't that a good number. I thought it would be just 30-40\n                                            └── It's not, already we are 1 month into the placement and not even 10% are placed.\n                                                └── 100+ is still good imo, can't do anything Abt the batch size\n                                                    └── But even though the last batch faced same issue, they had 250-300 at this point. So the situation is not at all good.\n                                                        └── It will get better , what can we even do other than hope and prepare\n                                                            └── Honestly looking at the market, it's not at all going to get better; It can at max reach the previous batch level; Hope is the only thing we can have\n                                                                └── That was only because of ibm last year  ig thats not the norm\n                                                                    └── It was the norm generally. But this year even ibm is doubtful of visit"
