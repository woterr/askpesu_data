It'll ask for your offer letter, nature of work, how you obtained, manager contact etc. Just ensure to fill it out quickly and get it approved.\n└── So, after that how will they give us grades?\n    └── A form is sent out to you after some time asking you to fill it in whenever you can. Note that you need to fill this in when you complete the required number of months to get all your internship credits (for us it was 3 weeks = 1 credit, so for 6 credits people worked 18 weeks and then filled). This form will take in your managers contact as well as an internship report which you need to draft. After that they contact the manager, and ask them to fill out a survey about you and your performance and rate your personal and technical skills. This rating is aggregated on a scale of 10 and then a grade is assigned.\n        └── Ok, thank you"
