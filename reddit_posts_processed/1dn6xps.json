Do you get options also how are the washrooms for 1st 2nd year etc.\n        ├── 3 people at ecc, 4 at amaatra, most people leave hostel in 4th year. In 1st year at amaatra u get a common washroom for one floor and in ec campus there is an attached washroom in each room.\n        │   └── not for 1st year in ec campus\n        └── I visited the EC campus hostel for 1st years which is outside the campus and it's got 4 people sharing and common bathrooms for the floors"

From 2nd year boys will be shifted to ec campus hostel (3 sharing) but girls have to either continue in amaatra or search for a PG nearby campus\n└── Is single or even double sharing not available in ec? What about rr?\n    ├── No not in ecc, idk about rr\n    └── nope, not in ec campus. for rr all hostels are in campus for boys\n\nfirst year is 3 sharing for all\n\nfrom second year you can choose 3,2,1. the preference is based on who paid the hostel fee first.\n        └── Ok, so I plan on branch change after first year (no need to say very difficult or you can't or whatever, we'll see what happens). But like, will I be able to get single sharing in rr boys hostel then? I'm sorry if this is a weird question.\n            └── good chances"
