It's unlikely for companies to still visit colleges for placements now. Everything practically closes by Feb-March. Beyond that you'll probably only have a handful visiting. Companies are either getting ready to onboard their new recruits or are looking into internship to FTE conversions at this stage. \n\nI'd suggest you to start looking for off campus opportunities ASAP. The on campus road is going to close soon, if it hasn't already.\n└── Thanks for the advise. Any pointers on where I can apply offcampus .\n\nI tried a few on LinkedIn but its tough to get shortlisted there. Any other sources?\n    └── I used to use Google Jobs, found it a better aggregator compared to LinkedIn. Additionally try reaching out to friends and asking for referrals at their companies.\n        └── Thanks.\n\n>Additionally try reaching out to friends and asking for referrals at their companies.\n\nThe problem with this is all my friends are either my age or younger. I don't have anyone who is senior than me who can refer me.\n            └── Is placement bad at pesu or u did not sit?\n                └── I wasn't well prepared in the initial months. And I only wanted to go for companies with package >8-10lpa.\n\nThose companies dropped drastically after sept end. Oct middle. Thanks to recession\n                    └── Was your GPA decent?"
