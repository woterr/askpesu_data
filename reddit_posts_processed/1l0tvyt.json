I was just curious\n└── Plus any ideas what r my options now?\n    └── Just learn from youtube dude. A week's worth of classes won't be enough to learn a new language. Also ₹5k for a course that doesn't even give credits??? No wonder nobody is taking them\n        └── I believe these are special topics which give credits, not the skill enhancement ones\n            └── But we never got any mail or announcements for special topics\n                └── what?? then are these the skill enhancement ones?\n                    └── Yepp"
