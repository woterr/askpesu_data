If you still have no clarity always take a core course because they will have several specializations to choose from throughout the 4 years of course.\n└── If you were in that place which one would you choose?\n    └── like he/she said it's always better to go for a core course, because 5-10 years down the line, you never know when trends will change. courses like cs are evergreen.\n        └── Thanks mate"
