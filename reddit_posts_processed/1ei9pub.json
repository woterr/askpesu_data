  "content": "Ok so this might sound kind of silly but I really need help here. Recently PESU academy was updated and now it's not compatible with my phone as my phone is an incredibly old model (Android 8.1). I have no money for a new phone. I tried searching on the web, but there is no apk file of the new app. Can someone, pls , create an apk file of the app and share it , especially for those whose phones aren't compatible? U basically need PESU app for many things and I can't keep logging into my computer at all times. Will be very helpful 🙏🏻",

Can't talk about the security, though, but I used to use it because PESU App disappeared from playstore for a while, and apk was the only option, and it worked fine.\n└── Umm I'm having issues downloading the apk because of my android architecture, guess cannot do anything about it. "
