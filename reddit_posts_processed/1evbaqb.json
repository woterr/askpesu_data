December starting or Dec ending?\n    ├── You can expect from Dec end to Jan first week range   \nFor us ( last yr) it was from jan 8th to 20th cuz they started a month late\n    │   └── Okay thank you!\n    └── last year when i was in third sem,  the end sems started on december 7th and ended on 22nd december or  one or two days after that. But they were over before the christmas\n        └── Okay thanks!"
