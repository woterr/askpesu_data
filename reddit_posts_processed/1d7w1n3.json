It has three phases each in 6th, 7th and 8th sem. \nThe first phase is of 2 credits which will be mainly your title finalisation and design approach finalisation.\nThe second phase the main phase will be of 6 credits, where you got to complete the implementation of the project. \nIn each of these phases you’ll have ISAs and ESA where you got to present in front of a panel of members and you will be graded accordingly. You will also have to meet or show your progress regularly to your guide. \nIn the third phase which is of 2 credits you got to publish your paper .\nEach phase you’ll be given grade like your normal courses like S, A or B"
