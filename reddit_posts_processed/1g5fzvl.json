(It's fine if you don't want to tell it)\n\nI got a seat for mba through Pessat but decided to go through pgcet since the fees will be less \n\nAnd I do remember a little (orientation for mba which i attended for pes ) basically they told a little about syllabus and about the new building, clubs , events , and placement which they claimed to be 100% only if your cgpa is above 7 or 8 \n\nThere is a dresscode ig they will give you\n└── the counselling date hasn't been scheduled yet and btw my rank is 449"
