And like do prople get money if they make more?\n│   ├── Karma is like a credit score that you get when people upvote your post or comment. Karma is like a reputation score which determines your credibility.\n│   │   └── Toh basically gaining sort of respect in this virtual world ?\n│   │       └── Yes something like that. In many subreddits, they expect a minimum karma on your account in order to upload posts there.\n│   └── lmaooo dude if karma paid, i'd be a billionaire thanks to my 200 reddit accounts. sadly all I’ve earned is a permanent residence in the depths of internet degeneracy\n│       └── will the society accept you ?\n├── I've already banned one.
