      "body": "Finish your other ESAs first instead of mulling over how you did in a single ESA and how it will affect your semester. After you get your grades, introspect on why you did not perform as well as you wanted to and figure out what changes to make to your study pattern. For now, focus on the exams and give them your best.\n\nI've written about this in length in a previous comment. Go through it by searching the sub."
