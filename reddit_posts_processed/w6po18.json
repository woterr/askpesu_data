If you don't want to continue in EEE, learn stuff related to the domain you want to get into.\n├── so, in theory I have opportunity to get into IT firm, even though im from EEE?\n│   └── Yes, absolutely! But you will have to learn related courses like Data Structures and all, that help you crack placement tests. Most of my batchmates did shift to software development, maybe just have a solid reason as to why you're not continuing with electrical.\n│       └── Thank you so much! Is it possible if I can DM you incase i have any further queries?\n│           └── Yes. Please do :)\n└── Is it easy to go for an electronics oriented background rather than a CS oriented background in EEE?\n    └── Absolutely. You can do specializations that lead you to your career goal."
