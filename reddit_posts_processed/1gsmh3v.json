Itd be mad tho\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Same Man, i am soo happy to hear this, if this really happens id just grind like day in day out and get off in my third year..\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ don't be too happy. like all other government agencies in this country, ugc loves to announce bold 'plans' but they dont implement shit.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ why would this be good?\nâ””â”€â”€ How would it save money though? The tuition fee isn't a fixed amount per year and is a function of the credits you take up in a semester. The moment you add more credits, the tuition fee is guaranteed to increase. And it's PES, they will definitely bump up the fees by a bit.\n\nOf course you'll save money if you don't stay in hostel, but I don't think that's the main outcome here.\n    â””â”€â”€ oh, well now that you mention more credits, the fees would increase. My bad broðŸ«¡"

It is a state private university which derives its powers from Karnataka Act no 16 of 2013 (PES University Act)\n    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Isn't it deemed to be university since 2018?\n    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Nope, PES hasn't gotten uni status from UGC, so not deemed\n    â”‚           â””â”€â”€ Either of us is living under a rock is what i feel.\n    â”‚               â””â”€â”€ @u/rowlet-owl pls clarify.\n    â”‚                   â””â”€â”€ A lot of jargon is being thrown around here but basically, PES is accredited as a University by UGC, which means that it has to follow whatever policies are being enforced by UGC. The key word here being \"enforced\", which means that UGC may choose to have guidelines and suggestions but PES is free to do as they choose (which is what happened during COVID) as long as it isn't a strict mandate. \n\n\"Deemed to be uni\" essentially means to be granted autonomy over it's functions. Which is what PES has. It became one in 2014. What you and the other commenter are referring to are the same.\n    â””â”€â”€ You're too young to remember how PES went out of its way to not listen to UGC during COVID\n        â””â”€â”€ I remember this incident, but this gentleman/woman is making me lose my brain fog down so wanted some clarity."
