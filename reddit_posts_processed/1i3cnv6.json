Dsa you need to practice. This time everyone scored pretty good, prolly cuz of the new grading system. Sem 3 was more scoring than Sem 2, for me atleast\n└── Where can I find Anurag's Web tech notes? \nIf u have them can u send them to me please\n    └── [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QYkEjhr8croubXsnYGh\\_dSaOC9vUd3NR?usp=drive\\_link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QYkEjhr8croubXsnYGh_dSaOC9vUd3NR?usp=drive_link)"
