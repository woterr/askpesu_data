Sit back and enjoy the bigger number on your gradecard, don't go around asking questions or else\n└── Will the min pass marks reduce? (Actually asking for a friend)\n    └── Yes it does. I know a guy who checked his esa papers because he got an E grade in math\n\nI looked at the marks and turns out he was supposed to fail. He got less than 40 when you combine everything. Only way he passed was relative grading i suppose\n        └── Oh that's good to hear.\nThanks a lot for the reply !"

If we take 60/2 = 30 in end sems, 37/2 = 18.5 , adding the two we get 48.5 (Rounded off to 50) this got me B grade. \n\nAccording to the official grading scheme  S is >90, A is 80-90 , B is 70-80.\n\nNow when batch underperforms, the grading scheme is reduced \n\nnow S will be 70+ , A for 60-70, B for 50-60\n├── That clears things up, thank you!\n├── You don't need to divide the internals marks by 2, do you?\n│   └── My bad, I was wrong\n└── Why did you divide 37/2. Shouldn’t your marks me 30+37 = 67/100\n    └── Yes , My bad mistake from my side"
