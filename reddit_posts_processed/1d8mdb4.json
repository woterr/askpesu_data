      "body": "I’m doing one rn for the summer I’m being paid 20k and I just finished 2nd year\n└── Does PES offer internship opportunities for the summer between 3rd and 4th years?\n    └── Yeah they do some are sent though mails like outside companies generally have a hackathon or like coding test rounds or you can do in college itself that won’t be paid most of the times but credits will be given . In Pes itself there are a lot of opportunities but yeah a lot of people go for it . Try pulling outside strings and go out and do better real life experience with people on the industry.\n        └── I specifically meant industry internships. Like do companies come for summer internships which can become FTE roles via a PPO? Like Microsoft, Amazon, JPMC, Atlassian, etc?\n            └── Not sure of getting a ppo via summer internships cause that’s barely 2 months . I know seniors who do the 6 month internship in the final year and get Ppo . Sorry you can ask others about this😬jpmc has done a 6 month internship and then Ppo thing last year for my sister. Idk about summer no idea\n                └── Leave the ppo thing aside, but companies come for those 2 month internships on campus or not?\n                    └── I can’t give you that exact information I’m not sure sorry. I just know there’s a bunch of them that we get informed about it through mail like very few but those have limited availability so yeah . Proper on campus I’m not sure wrong person to answer🤷🏻‍♂️\n                        └── No worries. Thanks for responding,"
