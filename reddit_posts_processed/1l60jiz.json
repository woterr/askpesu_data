So if u wanna take their inputs, it's 50-50 that it'll even help you.\n•The second batch just finished their 4th sem. So far it's been the exact same as CSE. We're yet to see the differences in electives (which start from 5th sem).\n•The third batch has only just finished their 2nd sem and haven't started anything department related so they can't really comment either.\n└── Oh alright, thank you for your reply, i appreciate it"
