      "body": "An E grade fetches you a GPA of 5. You need 42.5 marks to get a GPA of 5.\n└── For 8 or 9 cgpa?\nAnd how is this calculated... isn't cgpa dependent on the credit of the subject?\n    └── So to get 9 in a subject you will need A grade. And 8 would be B grade. \n\nTo make things perfectly clear let me take an example.\nLet's say your in 5th sem. You have 22 credits. Two 5 credit subjects and three 4 credit subjects. \nMarks breakdown(hypothetical)\n5 credit subject 1 - A(9)\n5 credit subject 2 - C(7)\n4 credit subject 1 - B(8)\n4 credit subject 2 - S(10)\n4 credit subject 3 - D(6)\n\nNow to calculate SGPA,\n(9*5+7*5+8*4+10*4+6*4)/22\nThat should be 8.\n\nAs for your percentage that you need, you just subtract GPA by 0.75(rule set by pes) and multiply by 10. So to get 8 you just do 8 - 0.75 which is 7.25 and multiply by 10 which is 72.5. So you 72.5 marks to get 8. \n\nHope that was helpful\n        ├── Thanks a lot\n        └── You mean 72.5 marks in total (out of 100) right ( contribution of isa,esa,assigment,mini project all reduced to 100 using rule set by pes)\n            └── Yes"
