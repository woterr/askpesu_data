      "body": "Pretty difficult, almost impossible. It actually depends on how many seats are available and the ranks of the kids who show up. Last year, barely 20 seats opened up for CS. If the same repeats this year, you'll need to hope that only 19 kids show up between ranks 1 and 1180, such that you can get the last seat. Given that there's literally a thousand kids before you, it's unlikely that only 20 kids in those ranks will show up.\n└── nobody says that. cutoffs almost always increase by atleast 200-500 ranks in second rounds. last year was the only exception because of the little scam they pulled"

Otherwise you will almost surely get aiml rr, or cs ec\n└── cs ec would be better than aiml rr or no?\n    ├── yes cs ec will be better\n    └── Yes cs is better. But if you want rr campus for the location or something then it's a decent decision imo.\n\nTill second year we learnt everything cs guys did and then some more. I will not recommend aiml until we properly know what the third year will be, but I'm sure it won't be that different or anything"
