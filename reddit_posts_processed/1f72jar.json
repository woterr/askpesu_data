I was on queue of 100 to 110.\n└── Yeah i had been there too. This is just outrageous. If u are going to give us rooms then inform us earlier so that we can atleast go and search for rooms or pgs.\n    └── Ikr 😔 I hope we get hostels man.\nIf not major L on their side\n        ├── Yeah, they increased the fees and also made the 3 sharing into 4 sharing just pathetic.\n        │   └── Ikr. bitches fr\nWhts ur backup?\n        │       └── I dont have any backup just hoping to get the hostel\n        │           └── Let's hope for the best🫠\n        └── As and 2nd yr std , even I faced the same problem last year but I can say that 80% of the 1st round kcet std get hostel for sure(nb or nbx I can't guarantee) you get option as It or mess block. According to me and my friends IT>>>>>>>>>>>>NB\n            └── U were right, I got the message regarding the briefing session\n                └── When did you submit your request for hostel room and when is the briefing scheduled for?\n                    └── I submitted on 4 sep around 11\n8th sep is the briefing session"
