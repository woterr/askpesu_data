  "content": "\n\nAs a second year boy at PESU EC college, I am saddened at the lack of goth girls who study here. The majority of girls here are Lana del Rey and Taylor Swift fans wearing kala kurtas and baggy jeans with a serious lack of personality and originality. I know that the nearly nonexistent representation of the goth girl subculture at PESU colleges is likely tied to a few aspects, like how PESU colleges are infamous for its grand parties and Fests, (not typically a goth girl interest) the constant depressing and cold atmosphere, and the overall lack of awareness about goth culture here. I know that my fellow PESU male students are also disappointed at the lack of goth mommies here, they likely just hide their pain better than I am capable of. Or even Perhaps I am merely looking in the wrong places. I believe without finding a goth girl my mental health will continue to plummet and I may also have to look into transferring to DSU or Christ if this issue does not get resolved.",
