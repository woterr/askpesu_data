I'm talking about a casual grp where freshers can connect with each other and have casual discussion\n    ├── eventually the curr one only will convert to casual no? its fyn\n    │   └── that's just an assumption that you are making and since the freshers will be joining us next week, I think it would be a good idea to create a WhatsApp group. This will allow everyone to connect with each other, make new friends, and be more social\n    └── What's stopping you from being casual on that group lol"
