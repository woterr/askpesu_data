Was 98.75 displayed on the big screen?\n        │   └── Nah management said the number when we called them\n        │       └── Hmm... a more transparent way would be to conduct an online/offline counselling with the release of official cutoff's, hope they do it this year...\n        │           └── Yeah fr\n        ├── that was very few seats compared to this year tbh\n        └── but till last year they had pessat this year jee mains seats have increased from 5% to 45% \n\nimo cutoff should decrease"
