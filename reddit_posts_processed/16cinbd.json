So, It depends on what you are applying for.\n└── GDSC's cloud development\n    └── Questions will be related to Cloud Dev. They kept a test before interview right. They might ask from that too\n        └── They didn't give a test. I had to just fill out a form. Also how many rounds of testing do they conduct?\n            └── Only 2\n                └── Oh ok.
