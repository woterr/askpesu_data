And yes there r normal classes, they tend to be a bit free depending on the teacher, but no free classes and stuff.\n└── 🙏😭\nThank u\nKinda expected this kind of an answer\n    └── Atleast this time they have opened AT for outsiders🤧\n        └── They have always been open to outsiders, no? Atleast in 2019 and 2020 before COVID shut down everything\n            └── Last year it wasn't the case tho, maybe because of covid as u said."
