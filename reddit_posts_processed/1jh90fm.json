  "content": "Heyy guys. So the thing is, I'm in ece sem 4 rn. I wanted to know how do y'all take up capstone project ideas, as in the projects which should be done for 2 years. And are mentors assigned by the college or should we select by our own. In the latter case, how do I know which teacher is best for me? Ik it's a lot of questions and too early also, but I really wanna start early, just to have an extra edge over the peers. Which domain would you recommend to choose for capstone(pls don't say \"choose anything that interests you\", because I am not sure what interests me), and if you have any teacher recommendations, please drop it. And basically anything you think your 3rd year self should've known before starting the capstone, please tell.\n\nTIA.",
