I am **making a travel plan with family from 12th to 16th** (Note: these are the only dates that works for all member travelling).\n\nI have couple of doubts:  \n- Is Orientation Program that is mentioned on PES website (important dates page) and Bootstrap same?  \n- Is it confirmed that Bootstrap will start on September 17th? I saw message in subreddit that it was announced on stage during 2nd batch of round 2 that Bootstrap will start on September 17th.   \n  \nIs there a way to officially confirm this **(any phone number that I can reach out to)** as I don't want to skip it?  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xxmvjpwb19md1.png?width=1452&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c31e3824c792f8902953b4dc569f8084008132c\n\n",
