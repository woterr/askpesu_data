Even a couple of companies from FAANG visit PES usually.\n    â””â”€â”€ I was trying to find google amazon microsoft and stuff maybe too high expectations sorry\n        â””â”€â”€ Google does not visit PES but there are multiple who get placed there off-campus. Search on LinkedIn, you will find multiple alumni.\n\nAmazon and Microsoft also regularly visit PES, maybe they did not visit this year because of the market. But last year they did visit.\n            â”œâ”€â”€ okay!  \n\n\noh is it? I did see previous years also and couldn't find them   \nMaybe missed so ill go and check again\n            â”œâ”€â”€ FYI, Google does not go to any college in India.\n            â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lmao, another day of being glad to not be in PES\n            â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Doesn't matter, plenty get placed off campus at Google every year alongside the (assuming) on-campus placed kids from BITS which is a highly regarded T1. This gives the PESts more credit here than the BITSians. \n\nClearly shows that you don't need that college tag which some of you are nothing without.\n            â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ T1 kids after reading this \"OmG  YoU gUyS sAlTy YoU cAnT gEt TaG bCuZ YoU dInDt ClEaR JeE eXaM \"\n            â”‚   â”‚           â””â”€â”€ It's always the insecure ones who say that because deep down even they know that once you take that tag away they don't really have any industry relevant skills. Their PCM abilities got them through JEE and they think that's enough to get them a job too. What's worse is that through the last Masters admission cycle I saw so many T1 kids under the delusion that their tag was enough to get them into top US Unis and that \"getting into IIT means I'm qualified for top Unis\".\n            â”‚   â””â”€â”€ uhh Google does visit colleges. I literally just saw a post on btechtards with the salary breakdown of Google's visit to Thapar.\n            â”‚       â””â”€â”€ oh okay, i think they go to only a handful of colleges in India.\n            â””â”€â”€ Also is there /will there be a \"apple recruitment cell\"\nIn pes \nApparently bmsce is getting one from this year \nIk one dude in pes who got placed in apple this year"

CSE average was shown as 14.5 and ECE average was shown to be 8.2 with placement percentage being 60% of CSE and 28% for ECE at RR campus. Can someone confirm if that was true or not?\n    â””â”€â”€ Total CSE students = 1486 ,  Placements for cse = 689 (Median = 12, Avg = 13.8 , Max = 52)\n\nTotal ECE students = 551, Placements for ECE  = 103 (Median = 8, Avg = 8.3, Max = 24.62)\n        â””â”€â”€ these are for both the campuses?\n            â””â”€â”€ I have mentioned RR campus , for both campuses I have put the placements stats picture above in this thread .

Check FAQs for more info.\n    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Brooo i already started dsa prep ! Btw pesu  guy told oa rounds are cheated a lot in all colleges including iits and nits is it true?\nEven i have skill and dis honestly can cheaters take my position?\n    â”‚           â””â”€â”€ Yes it does happen. Happens at PES, happens at IITs.\n    â”‚               â””â”€â”€ ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥²did you do same ? Is it compulsary or having enough grasp of dsa is enough?\nTrue even in cpp people have started cheating !\n    â””â”€â”€ Not a student but considering joining the college: Do CSE vs CSE AI/ML, CSE DS and these specialization branches differ in placements? Can students from one branch apply to placements for other CSE branches?\n        â””â”€â”€ Pretty sure they will all sit together for placements lol. There are no specialised roles for undergrad students, its very rare. Separation into teams by companies happens based on fit, and specialised roles especially AIML arent for freshers."
