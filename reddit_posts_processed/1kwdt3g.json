  "content": "There is a chance that I might get this branch through cet based on last year cutoff and frankly I'm interested in this field and want to be a part of this upcoming ai revolution. \nMy doubts are:-\n\n1) I have heard that core cs subjects are taught in ai ml as well so I was wondering if I can sufficiently learn other cs related subjects which are not included through self study or any other online resource.\n\n2) Will studying extra stuff be a huge burden? I mean can I do it without compramising college related stuff?\n\n3) Since the population at rr campus is quite large will I get enough opportunities, like placements, clubs, other activities?",
