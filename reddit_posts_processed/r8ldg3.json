Even if it does happen, current EC campus students will not be joining RR campus, they will simply increase the intake of RR campus to compensate for the seats in the EC campus.\n└──  I don't think they'll do that.\n    └── Yeah me neither. I was just saying they're definitely not moving all the current students from EC to RR\n        └── How's the current construction situation on campus? Can they actually accomodate such a huge increase in intake?"
