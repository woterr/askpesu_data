You have to apply and prepare for them on the go.\n├── If I try for internships after 6th sem, then will I be late for the good companies’ placements?\n│   └── Not really, more and more companies come up until the end of your 8th sem.\n└── but its compulsory to finish an internship before starting of 7th sem right?  \nwhat if I dont get one?   \nAlso what percent of the CS department normally gets an internship?\n    └── No, you have to finish an internship at least by the end of 8th sem. You also have the option of doing summer internship before the start of 7th sem but it's not compulsory. If you don't get summer internship, you can apply for summer courses provided by the college.\n        ├── Oh I see thanks for the clarification\n        └── Wait! you can earn max 6 credits through internships is there a mandatory number of credits required to be able to earn the degree of sit for placements during 7th or 8th sem what happens if we don't get the internship during 6th semester summer.\n            └── 160 credits is what you need in total at the end of your college to earn the degree. If you don't get an internship in 6th sem you can compensate for the summer internship credits by enrolling for summer courses which are 2 credits each. Then during 7th-8th sem , you must keep looking for internships and earn the required credits by joining in one.\n                └── Got it "
