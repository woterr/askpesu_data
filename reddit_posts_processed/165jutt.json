I don't recommend any more than that as it will clash with the main placements.\n└── Okay thanks, so 3 months internship we can do. Can you tell the approx starting date and ending date??\n    └── This depends on the company dude. Some start right in the first week of June, some mid June. Assume June-July for most people."
