You should make your decision based on factors such as your branch interest, future higher education plans, expectations from undergrad, and costs. There's a pros and cons post that explains in detail about the current situation.\n└── Will it improve anytime???\n    └── This is not something anyone can answer with surety. Although I can comment that it's only getting worse every year with no signs of improvement.\n        └── And for people like me who have no choice other than pes cse what to do????\n            └── If you don't have any other options, then there's no point speculating about it right? Accept what you have and learn to live with it. There is nothing else you can do. Make sure you don't regret it, that's all.\n                ├── I don’t know why i am even going, makes me regret taking pessat.\n                └── Is it good for BBA Courses?\n                    └── PESU is mainly known for engineering, and specifically CS. You should preferably make a new post and ask about this.\n                        └── I did that and No one responded LMAO"
