I felt like Hercules doing the 12 labours with how hard it was to get to college. Only reason I got to college is because I heard someone play KSI's new song and I got the willpower to go and turn that off",

Will bombs falling from sky make them declare holiday\n│   └── Maybe add napalm just in case they still don't budge\n├── Forget water.. there are literally people falling from the sky n We wrote exams in the same building the next day\n│   └── Someone cooked here\n└── Lol those days.. \n\nOur batch thought of calling some student union n all, LOL\nDore n his son didn't give a Fk, they didn't even conduct one single exam online..."
