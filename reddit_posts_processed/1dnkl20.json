Like say someone from EC CSE or CSE AIML switches to RR CSE. If second year has already begun, won't that person have hostel issues since I am assuming they would have already enrolled in the EC hostel? Also, what if someone from non CS switches to CS? They would miss 1 or 2 weeks of courses, won't they?\n    └── yes you are right"
