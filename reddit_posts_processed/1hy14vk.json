You can check PYQs and check out for yourself if anything has been repeated. \n\nAs for your next question, ESA is usually quite a bit harder than ISA with longer and more complex questions. Again, check PYQs to get an idea.\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ I see you everywhere and I love how you give a detailed and a consice reply everytime thanks a lot for saving me from my many dilemmas üôè"
