That is how they calculate metrics in all colleges. It's always the stats of the placed students. \n\nIt's actually a difficult problem if you think about how to account for unplaced students, because using a \"0\" for them would highly skew the results.\n            ├── Ah ok understood\n            │   └── The number isn't completely accurate because the total also includes students not sitting for placements. Eligible here only refers to those who could have sat for placements. Many choose Masters, off campus, etc.\n            │       └── Yea that's kinda reassuring\n            └── Is 1243 the no of eligible students from both campuses ?\n                └── Yes"

Of students placed were much higher so yea idk which one to actually trust since i saw both being claimed true by the placement head\n├── Hey hey can u plz send that?\n│   └── I really wish i had clicked that but i didn’t, anyone from ec campus can go into placement cell and share that, that’d be really helpful he had everything written on a whiteboard in his office\n│       └── No one's doing it 😭 fine thx for the info\n│           └── that’d be great if someone shared it would literally contradict these stats😭\n└── Maybe off campus included \n    ├── Off campus and ppos isn't comsiderd by pes\n    └── What kind of off campus placements have students pulled off that mean salary reached 17?\n        └── Bro maybe it's around 17 for on campus placements as well..\n            └── Yea that’s what i was saying and RR campus’s placement head idk he felt off to me but when i talked to ec one he knew alot and discussed everything in depth\n                └── Yeah he's nice... "
