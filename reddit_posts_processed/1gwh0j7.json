Additionally, consider searching for the Chrome extension \"Pesu Attendance.\" Once installed, navigate to the settings and adjust the attendance threshold to 75%.

(I.e not below 60) \n\nYou should get a medical certificate if you can , and definitely ask teachers if they can give attendance at the end of sem , most of them indeed give if there is shortage (3 teachers boosted my attendance upto 85 even though hard requirement was 75) Worst case you'll have to go to remedial classes and build attendance back.\n\n\nBut if it's below 60 at the end of sem , you're cooked. Only medical certificate can save you."
