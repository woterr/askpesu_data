However PES crowd is unmatched but the place is academically too rigorous (good for some, bad for some).\n├── Thank you\n└── Isn't PES placement a little better than BMSCE\n    └── While writing the answer I assumed it was PES via PESSAT. If that had been the case then the slightly better placements wouldn't have been worth 20L extra in fees. \n\nCheck my other comment where I said that if both are through CET then PES is the better option"
