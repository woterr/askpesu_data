      "body": "yes sometimes students have their backlog exam and their regular exam on same day same time , so when draft is released you can ask to change your backlog exam date.\n├── Still the backlog exam date changes right? No changes to the regular exam then why is it draft?\n│   └── It depends...and it won't be just yours, it'll be for every class across branches\n│       └── Sorry I’m not sure I understand but I might later on\n│           └── The backlogs occur at the same time as regular ESA. So if a backlog is in the morning or regular is in the afternoon there's going to be a problem or if the two occur at the same time.\n└── Always annoys my how backlog exams are mixed wuth regular ones.. i mean they could just finish off the regular and send us home and then deal with backlogs!\n    └── they have lot of courses and branches to take care , with respect to that this is probably the best solution."
