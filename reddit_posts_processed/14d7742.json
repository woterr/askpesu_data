I heard comedk some delay or sumn was there. Also comedk ise cutoff was 2110 and cs (ds) cutoff was 2080? Care to explain how much it would fall\n    ├── That cutoff was 2022's ignore the question mark after 2080\n    └── Electronics in RV closed at 6k and CS closed at 2k i believe.. like never in history the cutoffs went so high.. ece used to close by 1k max and cs by 500 max..\n\nComedk counselling was late.. kcet's 2nd round was gng on.. Bits , GFI,NIT,IIT all counselling was nearing to close.. and people who wanted medical too managed to get it through state counselling.. \n\nand COVID BATCH .. so I know its all over the place.. just take 2020 and 2021 for reference.. and hope for 2022 cut off   😏😉\n        ├── Holy!!! U ruined my day 😭😭 but i needed this \nthank you so much im Glad i got to know it sooner\n        └── But seats have increased this year also round 1 will go till 18th of july which means round 3 will most probably go till mid of august which may clash with csab and other counselings. I think pattern of 22 will repeat but ya for safer side pne must rely on 2021 cutoffs"
