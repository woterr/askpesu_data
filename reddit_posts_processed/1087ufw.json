CN and OS are core courses and are also tested quite a bit in placements, make sure to understand the concepts and pay attention. These are also tough courses (for most) so they do take more time. DAA is also important when it comes to placements, if you are strong with the basics and can handle the syllabus here then 60% of your placement prep is done. MPCA is a pain for most people, no advice here since I myself did terribly lol."
