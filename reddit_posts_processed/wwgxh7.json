At an undergraduate level you should pick whatever gives you a broad base. AI/ML is something you should go into for your masters. Abroad, if anyone sees that you did your bachelor's in \"AI/ML\" they're gonna laugh at you since it doesn't make any sense. Most likely the AI/ML course will be 80-90 % cse,  with few topics compulsory (whereas cse students will have them as an optional subject)"

Your degree will be treated as cse degree itself, both in resume and foreign universities, you won't be at any disadvantage.\nTherefore chose the better campus, i.e, RR.\nUnless ec is closer to ur place and u can avoid hostel expense."
