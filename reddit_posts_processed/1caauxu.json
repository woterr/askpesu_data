So,can I do it and is there gonna be a problem if I do so ?\n└── CGPA could be a little better, but that's fine, you cannot change it now\n\nSo I would say, whatever the role you are looking for \n1. Get your resume apt and perfect for the role. Don't lie on the resume, but make it relevant \n2. Whatever the ideal role is, start taking courses and join cohorts to upskill yourself so that you are ready for your eventual role\n3. Start writing cold emails and messages to hiring managers on LinkedIn and stuff. Build your network, it will help you now and later too\n    ├── I wanted to know, till when the companies are gonna come.\n    │   └── Probably at most May end. After that the new placement season starts.\n    │       ├── Shit\n    │       └── Were you or your friends able to apply to any of the companies after it started for the next batch ?\n    │           └── No clue. People don't really keep up with PES or its emails after they get placed.\n    └── What is the ideal cgpa?\n        └── 8.75+ if you're in CS"
