Curfew is 9 but u can come by 10pm and its all good\n    └── when u said fucking around i thought u meant like working on projects and stuff T-T,"

(Like specifics are limited with me sorry )\n\n[RR]\n- 3 courts there in sports area and actually very well maintained so it looks like good activity goes on there.\n\n\nSome more info will be like\nGood wifi in pes campus, yup sophos firewall restrictions are there, so don't try downloading games on vpn (friend got blocked off pes wifi lmfaoo)\n└── damn thanks for elaborate explanation lmao, really helps"

Through pessat or jee you have to pay too much fees and the return is not that good considering high fees. You may think fees is not a factor for you but paying high fees and running in a rat race again after jee is stupid. The academics need jee level of preparation and because you pay high fees the pressure on you to perform well is really high. So for your mental and financial well-being join only through kcet\n        └── ohkay thanksss ! :) ( not from karnantaka so cant give kcet😔)\n            └── Try other clgs bro, pes thru high fees is not worth it. "
