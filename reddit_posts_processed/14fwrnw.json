If you want to read more [here is my last comment about the branch](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/14f7uvi/can_anyone_share_the_latest_syllabus_pdf_for_cse/joylzan) and here's another comment about [why it's a bad idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/144xdwb/aiml_vs_cse/jni1zes)\n└── Would you by any chance have the syllabus? Or if possible can you get it?\n    └── As I said, it's new. PES updates/changes the syllabus of all branches every year. The first batch of AIML is yet to enter their branch (since the first year is common for everyone), so there is no syllabus as of yet."
