      "body": "I guess you should be looking for service based companies. They usually don't ask for 7+ cgpa. If you are lucky you can apply for the hand few product companies who don't keep any cut off. Otherwise join a service based company and work for 1 year. At the same time prepare for interviews at product based companies. You can then attend hackathons or get a referral to get a good offer. I don't have any idea of your skills. If you have specialized in some sort of development or some data science you can look out for startups. They usually don't care much about your grades but you should be technically strong. This is your best bet but you need to be lucky and have strong skill set.\n└── Can I dm you for advice?"
