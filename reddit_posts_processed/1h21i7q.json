Got paid for it after my full time began around August 2022 lmao\nâ”œâ”€â”€ If you dont mind answering \nHow much do TA's get paid,\nIs it diff for diff profs\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Yeah, different for different courses and profs, as well as the amount of work done.\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Thats peanuts!\nIts very less like cant even say :)\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ Can't generalise. We got paid almost 10k back then. But I do know some RAs who got paid as low as 2k.\nâ””â”€â”€ Even i did in aug-dec 2023 still didnâ€™t get paid"
