No one confirm which companies will come, placement office head told this - He also not sure who will come. He told to be patient also many good companies will come ( Not sure its true or not)\n        └── so whats in the list under summer 2024 is whats done already now for 5th semesters? So do you have a list like this for 2023 summer?\n            └── No this list is for 2024 batch (7th sem) , so this is 2023 summer.  3-4 companies from this have visited already + many others. You can expect companies ZPMC , ZSCALAR , Expedia coming.\n                └── Ah so this time was better. We had Arista Networks. PayPal was off campus. Microsoft, Goldman, intuit, VISA, Morgan Stanley, Adobe, Fidelity done.\n                    └── yeah i feel this year it better, VISA didnt come still but many other companies came. Jan many companies have scheduled interviews.\n                        └── that's good to hear."
