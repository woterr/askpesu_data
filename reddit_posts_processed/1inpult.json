      "body": "chill bro , lol i may sound dumb but if u are really too keen to make friends join the pesu hostel bro its the best way to make friends\n└── i actually agree. my antisocial ass would have 0 friends today had i not stayed in hostel.\n    └── would it still help if I move to hostel next year?\n        └── probably. i'm assuming you're female (based on your avatar), and the girls' hostel straight up sucks sometimes and many people move out after their first year, it's off-campus, and the warden was a massive biyatch, but nearly everyone I knew there made decent friends.\n            └── I live like 10km away, would it be a good choice for 2nd yr?\n                └── if you struggle with social ineptitude, you’ll have a hard time in a hostel too. maybe it’ll push you to be more social, maybe not—there’s no guarantee, and there’s no way to predict what will happen. either way, it’s not worth spending an extra lakh just for that.\n\ninstead, try making friends in college first. i struggled with this in high school too, being quiet and reserved. even now, i admittedly still find it challenging to an extent, but i’ve learned a few things that help. crack a harmless joke, ask people questions about themselves—it makes them feel like you’re interested in them. talk to the people sitting around you in class. even something as simple as “did you get what the teacher just said?” or “do you know when the assignment is due?” can start a conversation. offering a random compliment like “i really like your t-shirt, where’d you get it?” also works.\n\njoin clubs like rotaract or paws, but don’t just sign up—actually attend meetings and talk to people. show up regularly so you become a familiar face. if starting conversations feels awkward, try being helpful instead. if someone’s struggling with a subject you’re good at, offer to explain it. people naturally warm up to those who are helpful.\n\nif group settings feel overwhelming, focus on one-on-one interactions. and don’t overthink it—so many people are just as unsure as you, they just hide it better or put on a front. but at the end of the day, you *have* to put yourself out there. you could be the most interesting person in the world, but if you don’t make an effort, no one will ever know that. you have to fight every nerve in your body that tells you not to talk to that girl/boy sitting next to you or that group of people in class. you’re afraid probably to embarrass yourself. but here’s the thing: you fail every time you don’t try. so you may as well try. it does wonders for your confidence.\n\nhope this was of a little help, and i hope you find your people\n                    └── Yeah thank you this was really helpful. but I wanted to move to hostel to get out of my comfort zone and to experience hostel life uk\n                        └── ahh i see, you can dm if you have any questions about it\n                            └── I'm not able to dm you"

      "body": "Made a large group of friends (9 of us to be exact) in my first year. Survived college together and we're still going strong. Some of us are pursuing our Master's now and 4 of us are in the US. Although life's gotten busy and coordinating timezones is difficult, we still do talk pretty regularly. One of them is even my flatmate here lmao. It's been almost 7 years since I met them and our friendship is just like the college days. \n\nIt's just your second semester. Give yourself some time to find people who match your vibe. Put yourself out there by taking part in different events and activities and find people with shared interests. Talk to everyone and don't isolate yourself from people If you're someone who always keeps their guard up, let it down a little and let people in. You'll eventually find people who match your energy. \n\nAlso didn't I match you and someone else on your previous post xD\n└── idk feels good to know its not only a individual problem yk, this explains all the repetitive questions lol\n    └── I'm aware it's not an individual problem and I'm also aware that COVID and all the online learning during people's formative years have stunted their social abilities. Most friendships begin organically through shared interactions and activities, be it online or offline. \n\nHowever, the solution to OP's problem is to mingle with people, not ask if it's okay to be lonely and complain about not having friends.\n        └── true, some form of venting\n            └── For this sub: vent once, okay. Vent twice about the same problem on consecutive days, not okay."
