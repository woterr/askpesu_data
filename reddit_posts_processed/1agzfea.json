You get 50% and 40% totalling to 90\n└── It's actually reduced to 20 and 25%.\n    └── 20% of the year's fee is same as 40% of a sems fee, which is what you'll be getting\n        └── Ah I see thanks"

Right now both are given semester wise\n├── MRD merit scholarship (25% fee reimburser it is given on the total fee to the top 5%of the class only if the CGPA is 9 and above)\n\nProf. CNR merit scholarship (20% fee reimbursement given on the total fee to the top 20% of the class only if the SGPA is 8.5 and above)\n│   └── So anyone who has  SGPA above 8.5 will get a CNR scholarship . Is it??\n│       └── If you've paid the additional amount to avail the scholarship and if you're in the top 20% i.e the top 15, then yes\n│           └── k.....thanks!!\n│               └── >k.....thanks!!\n\nYou're welcome!\n└──  Hi..If I’m aiming for MRD in 3rd and 4th sem, do my 1st and 2nd sem GPAs count? They’re in the 7.5–8 range, so am I already cooked or still in the game?"
