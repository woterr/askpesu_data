  "content": "So the first round PESSAT councelling took place and the cut off for EC campus CSE stopped at 2432 ( 0 seats left )   \nThe second round will be after KCET round 1, and there's no known date regarding when this would be happening. However, my doubt was, to what possible PESSAT rank would PES EC CSE go upto in the second round? Last year it was about 1500 and 2100 in the first and second round respectively. Any guesses would be appreciated.   \nThanks",

      "body": "Here's a analysis 👍\n\nAt this point the cutoff doesn't matter much because 1200-2400 rank batch had only 472/1200 people iirc(I was there). In that too after 1700 rank only ~120 people were remaining. This means that 1700-2400 rank range had very less people attending the counselling and consequently the high cutoff. My intuition says if more people show up in the second round counselling who didn't come in the first round thinking that they won't get CSE with the ranks above 1.7-1.8k(seeing last year's cutoffs) , the cutoffs might remain pretty much the same or even decrease (10% chance).\n├── I'm confused with certain aspects of your analysis. Would you mind if I DM you?\n│   └── You can DM me👍\n└── Is it possible to get cs(ai ml) at 240X rank in the first round as the counselling date clashes with advanced date?\n    └── I don't really know the situation now dude. The dynamics of number of seats and fees has changed so it'll affect the cutoffs definitely.\n        └── Alright thanks!\nEitherway, gonna meet you soon🫡"
