I'm just bored at home Lol got nothing to do. But yeah pilani is ofc better than goa but the difference ain't that big like you aspirants and misguided peeps assume it to be lmao.\nâ””â”€â”€ pilani cse median is above 33L and that of goa/hyd is like between 25-28L"

      "body": "There is no right tier system, because there is no accurate way to rank colleges into tiers. The entire concept is ambiguous. \n\nThe truth is, unless you are going to IIT/NIT/BITS/IISc/IIIT or any of the other *very* well known institutions, you do not have any significant competitive edge by being in any college. Odds are you'll do similar in your career, regardless of whether you end up joining PES, Manipal, VIT, SRM, etc. Since your college isn't going to magically open any doors for you, it's on you to study hard, pick up skills for the industry and make yourself hireable.\nâ””â”€â”€ Hm so the student's skill will decide at the end\n    â””â”€â”€ Yes. Only your skills can land you a high paying job/good uni for Masters. Your college by itself won't do you any favours if you don't have the skills."

VIT on the otherhand is a \"dream college\" because they provide \"dream packages\" of 6 Lpa at your dear mass recruitment companies. So generous of them to be fair :)"
