Or do all people that get above 8.5+ get it?\n    └── You will have to qualify both the conditions \nFor ex last sem I everyone performed bad so gpa was bad for to 20% students too but still the students who crossed 8.5 only got scholarships.\n        ├── Oh right thanks!\n        └── Wait if I have 8.5 above cgpa including the 5th sem and below 8.5 excluding it and have above 9 sgpa for 5th sem am i qualified for the scholarship?\n            └── Bro CNR(40% one) depends on your SGPA \nIf your CGPA is less than 8.5, but your SGPA for that semester is greater than 8.5 and you are among the top 20% of students, you will be eligible for a scholarship.\n                └── So this means can someone be eligible for both MRD and CNR scholarship in the same sem?\n                    └── If you're eligible for MRD ofc you qualify for CNR. But youll get MRD."
