Minors courses don't affect your Major's CGPA in anyway.\n    â””â”€â”€ And moreover minors credits are counted separately and are not part of your major degree course\n        â””â”€â”€ Yes, but they still contribute to CGPA and are counted while calculating your CGPA (for the minor)\n\nThat's what OP was asking about, not whether it affected the major's CGPA. Apologies of my answer was ambiguous.\n            â””â”€â”€ wait so Constituion and evs are not calculated in our first year gpa since they are compulsory courses?\n                â””â”€â”€ They will be calculated. Please read the FAQ"
