This is one golden opportunity to make some amazing college memories which you'll get to look back to in the future. \n\nYou really won't get too many chances like these at PES, make the most of whatever comes to you. Go out there and have fun, you're barely in 2nd semester. 2 years from now you won't have the time for all this. This goes for any fest, contest, club activities etc that come your way. Make the most of these events to make life at PES better.\n\nMake the most of your college life dude. This time won't come again :)"
