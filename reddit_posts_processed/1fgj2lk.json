I only recieved the SRN number which i used to log into the app\n    ├── The ID I got has an expiry date of September 2024, which means they'll probably give a proper ID later on, maybe after Bootstrap. Not everyone has an ID card, dw\n    │   ├── Oh ok thanks\n    │   ├── Oh ok thank you!\n    │   └── Oh ok thanks\n    └── Ayyo when did they give the srn, also, are srn and prn the same?\n        ├── Sorry I only got the PRN but I was told the SRN number is just the email Id registered\n        │   ├── Ahh I see, thanks!\n        │   └── When did they give PRN?\n        │       └── I got it when I submitted all my documents\n        │           └── Are you a pessat student?
