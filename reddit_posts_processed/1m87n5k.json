But since it's only CSE and ECE, their stats are definitely gonna be better. And Bangalore location advantage and the fact that IIITB does not have only Btech, it's Integrated 5 year MTech which means students get to specialize more and also become more valuable in the industry.\n│           └── they have btech programs too, but is it worth to join that?
