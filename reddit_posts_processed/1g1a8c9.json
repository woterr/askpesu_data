I am primarily looking for internship in 8th semester. \nMost of the companies which come right now, do gpa based shortlisting,even t2 companies.\nAre there companies that hire for non tech roles?\nI don't care about pay right now. I am looking for a job in a decent company.\nI'm a cse grad by the way.  ",

I know quite a people with 6 who got placed. But I'm looking for the right company. Someone who values a bit of non tech skills.\n    └── I'd say go for Big4 because I don't see any other major non tech companies coming on campus rn."
