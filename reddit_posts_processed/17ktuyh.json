Bcz i think(I'm not sure) that instead of writing PES1UG23 I might have written PES12023, but the next part of the srn is correct. I didn't realise this during exam nor when I came out after exam. But idk why, it striked just now, all of a sudden. Again, I'm not sure what exactly I've written!! Please tell me, I'm scaredðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­",

Some people get contacted later to sort such issues out if they can't resolve the mistakes on their own.\nâ””â”€â”€ So no problem, right?\n    â””â”€â”€ I cannot guarantee that nothing will go wrong, but be assured that if something does go wrong they will contact you via email and ask you to visit the CoE to sort things out. If you're really worried, visit the CoE whenever your ISAs end\n        â””â”€â”€ Thank you so much!"
