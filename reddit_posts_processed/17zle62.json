And I had to pay 2k per day I attended anyway. They gave back the rest. If you're surrendering PESSAT seat for a KCET seat in PES itself I'm not sure about the process.\n├── Yeah I'm trying for CET seat in PES itself\n└── For 2022, there was a ugc order stating that full fees refund is mandatory so I went back to pes rr and complained, they returned the 2k per day cash but kept the 10k pessat counselling fee"
