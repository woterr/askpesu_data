      "body": "Your experience will greatly depend on two factors: (1) the project you get assigned to and (2) the prof who advises you. Unless these two factors work in your favour, you will be in for a hard time. I was at CCBD and I got to work with KVS on an interesting problem statement that aligned (somewhat) with my interests. So we actually did a good bit of work and it was fun. Similarly, I know people who were unfortunate and didn't have a good prof/problem statement and were unhappy throughout the internship. Analogically, I've also heard anecdotes about the same at other labs like CDSAML and ISFCR. \n\nI've explained more on this in an old comment which you'll have to find, but to summarise, it's only worth it if you find a good alignment with the research being pursued and the prof. Else you'll not really have a good time. Look for what they're working on, the profs, the projects they're currently looking into (and what their past students worked on) and that will give you a good idea if you like the work. \n\nAre there benefits? Absolutely. A good research oriented LOR from a prof and a paper, if you do good work. But all this is possible only if your interest matches with what you're working on.\n└── my ideal plan is to grab a good internship by end of 3rd year, hopefully convert it into a PPO and have that tension off my head, then work a few and maybe do masters then. What should be my plan of action then?\n    └── GRIND DSA. That's all. Big companies will come to take summer interns in ur 5th & 6th sem, and the only thing I saw that matters to them is how strong are your fundamentals and DSA. You gotta be at a very good level in Competitive programming n all to crack the OAs tho..\n\nWe didn't know about all this as our seniors told no companies came for them in 5th sem T_T.. Most of us were unprepared..\n        └── What is a good cg to have \nMy cg is around 8.1 \n4th sem btw\n            └── You'll be eligible to write atleast 80% of the OAs next sem and 6th sem combined\n                └── Mine is 6.9 cgpa(till 3rd sem) 🥲.It would cross 7 after 4th sem results. Any chance for these internships in 6th sem?\n                    └── Tough. But get good at solving OAs and you might get through."
