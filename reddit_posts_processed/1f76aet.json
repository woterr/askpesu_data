Whoever gets like 9.5+ at the end of year, can avail this scholarship- is it like that?\n    └── the 5% is cgpa. the remaining 20% is sgpa. \n\nbut it mostly does not make a difference as people who top one sem tend to top the others as well. there's probably a few people out of thousand to whom this distinction mattered\n        └── so if u top the first semester, you get the scholarhsip then itself or is it after the year ends?\n            └── you get it in the middle of the next sem"
