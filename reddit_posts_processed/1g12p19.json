  "content": "Hello world!\n\nAfter spending years on this subreddit (and demanding the current mods every month to make me one), I'm happy to announce that instead of reporting spam posts I can now directly delete your post as the new mod on this subreddit. I'm glad you guys found my answers helpful and I look forward to redirecting many more of you to the FAQs.\n\nQuite evidently, I've been busy with life since moving countries and I haven't been able to get to all your questions. I might never be able to return to my previous activity frequency but I will try to get to your messages/posts/comments at *some* point. I hope you all understand the inevitable delays. Usually, DMing me on Discord (or WhatsApp, if you have my number), is quicker and more convenient for me than reaching me on Reddit. \n\nTo celebrate this \"success story\" as the other mod calls it, I *might* hold an AMA soon since I get quite a few messages every day asking about myself from you all and I'm in the mood to tinker around and check out the AMA feature in action. The occurrence of the AMA would depend a lot on my availability as well as interest from your end, so it will only happen over a future weekend.\n\nAlso, not going to entertain questions like \"when do I get a winter break?\". I don't know, I don't care and its the least of my worries at the moment. Also, you're in PES, what winter break are you talking about lmao\n\nCheers\n\n\\~ your rowlet anna",
