All it does is keep increasing the volume to max and starts moaning like shit. I fished through the app's files and realised that the app doesn't even have an Indian origin, it's Chinese. The scripts were compiled .Lua files, so i couldn't read them.\n\nEdit: Who's a ds teacher?\n    â”œâ”€â”€ Data structures teacher, ds is a course in 2nd year\n    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Oo okay\n    â””â”€â”€ I think you can open lua files in an editor. Lua is a programming language\n        â””â”€â”€ I know it dude, but the content in the Lua files are encoded in base 64. When I decrypt them, it just returns random non-renderable characters.."
