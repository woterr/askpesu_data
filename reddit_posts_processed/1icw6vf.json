I do not remember if they show final ISA, as far as I remember, they do not.\n└── are there teachers present there? and is it classwise the list?\n    └── You are overthinking it lol. We had to go to the department office and sign; nobody there cares about how much you have scored - they just want you to sign and move so others can sign it. The sheet used to be ordered by SRN for us, not sure about it now.\n\nDon't overthink it - nobody out there cares about how much others have scored. Once you sign the sheet, the marks are finalised and entered into the system. People are more concerned with their correct marks being entered. And yes, there can be errors, so check thoroughly.\n        └── okayy thanks alot rowlet 🙏"
