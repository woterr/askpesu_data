Not the actual weighted average of the number of students they took. \n\nEssentially say only two companies came. One offering 100 lpa, and the other offering 10lpa. And the first hired 1 person and the second hired 1000 people. \n\nThe average on this sheet would show 55lpa. But the average that people usually talk about in this case would be the weighted average which would be close to 10lpa\n\nIf the creator is reading this, please fix it dude\n    └── And some companies are also missing as per the comments on this post"

Apple only came for 7 GPA this time.... but they end up taking min 9.5+ for interviews lol\n            └── I'm currently on 8.46 CPI and was wondering if companies reject 8.4ish people just cos they're not 8.5 exact mm\n                └── Tbh .... Placement is a game of luck .... Sometimes ppl with 7-8 also get shortlisted for OAs while some with 9+ only don't. Eternal pulled that crap. So many above 9 din even get shorlisted while the cutoff they gave was 8.5+. And blud .... U have another whole year to max ur GPA .... but yeah, advisable to pull that above 8.75+ atleast for a hassle free tier 1 shortlisting\n                    └── Yeah GG, will try my best... to atleast not lose this this GPA battle alas can control the controllables......"
