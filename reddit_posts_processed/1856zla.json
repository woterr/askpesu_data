The affidavit thing is complete bs.\n└── I have a valid medical certificate...and my minimum is 75% in maths and we have 15 more sessions...so hopefully I will be fine"

But whenever I went to class I used to listen to class with complete attention and respond to the questions asked and also used to score pretty well in ISAs.
