Later figured he has free yt lectures. And av summaries are teams presentation with the bloke teaching while showing a piece of paper from his phone.\n    └── Wdym unit 3, all slides are his. All units. Did they change that now?\n\nI'm not saying pes is giving us perfect materials, but you should've figured this out"
