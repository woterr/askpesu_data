Please enlighten me on this\n└── If you're learning something from scratch and have time, use AI minimally like gpting some errors is no problem. This is usually applicable for personal projects since in PES you don't get a lot of time to learn and do stuff from scratch specially in 3rd year, you will have to build fast, for that AI Code Editors are kinda needed. Cursor, Windsurf, roo-code, replit to name a few."
