You need to finish the course to get your degree. Drop is when you don't.\n        â””â”€â”€ Will a withdraw affect your SGPA or CGPA negatively? I scored really well in math in ISA1 but due to unfortunate circumstances couldn't do the same in ISA 2 and that's obviously going to affect my grade. I was aiming for \\~9.5 CG just for context. What happens if I withdraw from math rn?\n            â””â”€â”€ It just means you need to take it again some other time...like a regular subject.\n                â””â”€â”€ So how will this semester's SGPA calculated? If previously they were calculating out of 600 marks (all 6 subjects), they'll only consider 5 now? So out of 500?\n                    â””â”€â”€ Yes\n                        â””â”€â”€ and for the next sem it'll be out of 700?"
