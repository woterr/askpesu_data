Back then you needed to give them a copy of your ID card as well as a letter that attested that they are submitting it on your behalf. \n\nI'd suggest emailing the COE and asking if this option is still valid. They are usually prompt with replies so you should email them by tonight such that you get a response tomorrow and can arrange your next steps."
