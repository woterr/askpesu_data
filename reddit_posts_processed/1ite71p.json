  "content": "iâ€™m in my 4th semester of cse, and iâ€™m starting to feel really disconnected from everything. i didnâ€™t choose this field because iâ€™m really passionate about it. it just seemed like the logical choice, epecially since both my parents are in tech, and it felt like a reliable path. \n\niâ€™ve been coding since 7th grade (my school introduced it to us very early), and while iâ€™m decent at it and comfortable with computers, my interest in this field has really started to wane.  even the subjects I thought i enjoyed were ruined by shitty teachers. it doesnâ€™t give me the excitement i see in so many of my classmates. i see them discussing career paths, domains, future studies, projects etc., and i really don't give a single fuck about any of these things. iâ€™ve realized that my brain isn't wired for \"analytical\" thinking. iâ€™ve always been good at writing even made some money from it (although very little), and iâ€™ve always enjoyed social sciences in general. i can definitely see myself working in tech, but i just know itâ€™s something that will bore me out and piss me off soon. i know plenty of people feel the same way, but cs is the so called \"safe\" path for anyone who isnâ€™t rich, so people stick it out, even if theyâ€™re miserable.\n\n iâ€™m honestly unsure about my future, but i canâ€™t even talk to my parents about it since i already chose engineering after they asked me a hundred times if i was sure.

      "body": "Lately, Iâ€™ve been feeling a bit uninterested, especially since starting my third year. My passion for aviation hasnâ€™t faded, I still follow it closely and hope to pursue it seriously someday if things work out in my favor.\n\nLooking back, Iâ€™ve learned a lot in CSE and coding, and Iâ€™m genuinely grateful to my friends for helping me stay updated. However, I canâ€™t shake the feeling that many of us ended up here not because it was our true calling, but because we didnâ€™t have many great alternatives. \n\nSo Maybe thatâ€™s why the best thing we can do is support each other and eventually work toward our real goals.\n\nWith my third year coming to an end, it feels like college life is officially winding down. Honestly, it hasnâ€™t been the most exciting experience, maybe because Iâ€™ve been a bit introverted and didnâ€™t interact much with seniors or even many people from my own batch. Looking back, that might have made the journey feel more monotonous than it actually was."

I thought i was the only one feeling like this ðŸ˜­\nâ””â”€â”€ nah, trust me, you're not the only one. i know plenty of people in college who were forced into cse by their parents. pretty sure thatâ€™s the case for at least half the engineering crowd."
