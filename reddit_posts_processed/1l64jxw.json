  "content": "So according to my research on reddit and discord i got to know that the easiest available electives are GT and CNS for e2. But for e1 there is no definite answer it is mostly AC,IOT and HCI. But people said HCI is hard to score but the syllabus is easy so im confused.\n\nCan seniors please describe these 4 subjects how those subjects are, how are ISA/ESAs , projects etc and help me choose easy electives cause my gpa is low and i wanna hit 8 cgpa by the end of sem 6\n\n(Referred Rowlet's comment but posting this again cause many ppl told for some elcectives syllabus has been changed, i wasnt sure for which subs)",
