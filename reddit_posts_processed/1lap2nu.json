  "content": "I feel there’s not much information available about this elective independenly, so I’ve created a dedicated post for it. Seniors who have taken it, could you please share your experience based on the following parameters: the nature of the subject (i.e., is it more theoretical or lab-based?), the exam pattern, marking in ISAs/ESA, the faculty (we have Animesh Sir this time), or any other insights you think might be helpful.\nYour input would be greatly appreciated!",
