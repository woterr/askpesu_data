Organize them by course, semester and the major\n        â””â”€â”€ those already exist, in fact people have made entire websites just for making the study material more accessible, like betterpes and (insert shameless self promo music) [angadrive](https://drive.anga.codes/collection/?id=UP3dwiNBROnrnHu)\n            â””â”€â”€ i know an arch club member when i see an arch club member"

The relief i felt when I realized it wasnâ€™t mine\n        â””â”€â”€ thats WILD, good on u man\n\nme personally, i only ever fail _half_ of my subjects\n\nmostly because im busy doomscrolling reddit instead of studying for tomorrow's ISA\n            â””â”€â”€ >mostly because im busy doomscrolling reddit instead of studying for tomorrow's ISA\n\narent we all"

Also I love it when I open the app and I am logged out and need to re login.\nNot to mention the spam notifications I get OMG I LOVE THOSE.\n\n\nThe seating info? They choose to not update it on the app and I specifically need to use the website to check it (haha in that way I open not one but two of pesuacademyâ€™s wonders )\nâ””â”€â”€ omg yea the mobile app is its whole own can of worms"
