Although its best to ask someone in psych - maybe reach out to someone on PESU discord.\n└── Thank you for your kind reply, appreciate it, I emailed PESU admissions, they were not really forthcoming with the dates... even tentative timelines...\n    └── Usually the first date of classes is the same across programs. But yeah as I said, reach out to a current first year."
