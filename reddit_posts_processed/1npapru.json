  "content": "Has anyone missed a special topic ESA in the 7th semester to attend a conference? Especial if the conference has a virtual option but you still choose to attend physically? Another problem is that the conference is not scopus indexed. It's web of science affiliated and it says on the website that ' the papers will be submitted to web of science for consideration '.\nIs there any alternate exam we can write or will it appear as a backlog?\nAlso it's not for capstone, it's a regular course project that the paper is for.",

They are the only ppl who can help you out in this situation. After all special topics carry 2 credits, so Idk how it will be evaluated if you miss an ESA"
