Uber and confluent\n    â””â”€â”€ Yeah no the real problem is PES refusing to keep tests on campus (with actual invigilation)."

This was the only year they came for SDE role and we fucked up.\n    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Hey do you know much they pay for non-SDE roles?\n    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ And are they hiring for non-SWE roles too in PES?\n    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Not this year , last year they did\n    â””â”€â”€ Last year they didnâ€™t hire Software Engineers from PES. This looks like Software Engineer compensation. I think other roles compensation is lesser, I maybe wrong though."

Few of them answered with brute force method. But they wanted a optimised solution.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ On one hand that seems unfair since I believe technical skills are just as important but if the company is paying 33.5L per year , itâ€™s fair that they have some insane standards, if they were smart they would have come at the start of the semester\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ But its not fair judging someone by giving some hardest DSA question, he/she might be good in problem solving skills or leadership.   \nMan have to say because of this coding ai tools like Copilot, Trae and cursor legit i have forgotten how to code backend and stuff.   \nBut you the logic working and thats enough, if you understand whats happening and build stuff is good  \nThese companies should check that. Straight up a random ass tough dsa question and rejecting.\nâ””â”€â”€ My friend interviewed with them last year(Not PES).\nTheir first round - Hard DSA question\nSecond round - Concurrency\nThird round - HM interview\n\nHM interview is where they tell people to get lost if their resume isnâ€™t good (This is what happened to my friend). Concurrency is where they test the skills they needed. I donâ€™t think this is bad compared to any other high paying company. DSA is the best way to judge since it is mix of problem solving and coding. Thatâ€™s why every bigtech conpany does that.\n    â””â”€â”€ Agreee"
