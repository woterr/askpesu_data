As far as faculty is concerned.. there are good people and bad ones everywhere.. just because you are in rr campus doesn't necessarily mean u will get the best teachers... In the end most of us use yt and other mediums to understand.. it's like.. if someone tells.. Allen is better than base or vice versa ... It's all based on the individual... \nThe main rr campus is kind of a pain.. the traffic is insane.. and in general.. I feel both campuses are good.. yes rr may have a bigger building.. but how does that matter...\nMoral: go for ec campus.. if it's close to your home or u want to stay in hostel/pg.. \nU will get the same opportunities in both campuses...don't worry"
