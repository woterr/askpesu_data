U may need to brush up ur 12th bio for 4th sem tho as mold bio would need it. So maybe focus on learning coding if u are interested as u will not be encountering coding for an entire year. Maybe try to learn some bioinformatics and stuff if u are interested. If u rlly want , check out the slides on discord and prolly go through some earlier chapters of class 11 bio and chem, u won't be needing anything else . "
