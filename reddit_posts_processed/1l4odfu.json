      "body": "Second round is usually a month after first round. And no, usually there are at most a handful of seats left in each branch in second round. If you do not get a branch in first round, 95% chance you will not get anything in second round.\n├── as the data last yr around 1.6 k was for cse core in rr campus via pessat(35%)...this yr 45% is jee mains, i got 1.5k rank,,, could i possibly get cse aiml in rr??\n│   ├── Ull get core cse in 2nd round, but aiml is pretty much guaranteed \n\nWhats ur jee percentile that got u a 1500 rank?\n│   │   └── 94.7%ile\n│   │       └── Jee math and college math are a bit different\n\nU can only upgrade ur seat in 2nd round, the seat u had in first round remains with u, and only if u choose a different seat in 2nd round ur original seat is relinquished and added to the pool of available seats\n│   │           └── fair enough, they are different, ill go for 2nd round and try fo rcore cse\n│   └── Nobody can predict. Attend counseling and find out\n└── Not really, in our second counselling last year there were over 150 core cse seats free, led to cutoffs falling drastically due to the spillover effect \n\nTbf this general thought process probably caused most people to not attend second counselling and led to the inflation so might not repeat this year but eh, never say never\n    └── Although what you said is true, you should also be aware that what happened last year was an outlier event, far removed from the normal expectation. Right from my own counseling back in 2018 up till 2024, the number of seats in the second round have almost always been at most 20-25 per branch. What happened in your intake was very unexpected and did not align with historical patterns. There were probably many external factors that worked to make it happen, nobody can explain with certainty.\n\nRegardless, my advice would always be to depend on generic historical data and not outliers. A starkly different outcome in one year does not invalidate the general trend.\n        └── Yep definitely not normal, aiml in ec campus closed at some 7000 rank which means quality of intake was pretty low\n\nWould be better if it didnt happen again this year"
