Cs is like a safe choice if you dunno what to do with career cause youll have a higher chance of securing a good job. Mechanical on the other hand, only take if youre passionate and interested in it, otherwise itll be hell. Yeah idts mech will ever go out of fashion."

We code for different applications. CS is just more stable in India. In mech, most people go do masters. Others have family connections in PSUs. Some family businesses, others start their own start up"
