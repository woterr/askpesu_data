They also ask parents to keep a closer watch on their children xD.\n\nAlso, college isn't like what's depicted in movies/shows, atleast here. Get that image out of your head before your expectations get smashed to pieces in the first month. Nobody's throwing parties every other week - people are struggling to find time to breathe and relax here from the constant stress.\n\nFests have been discussed before on this subreddit, search and you shall find out more.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ i had too many expectations\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Read through the comments here, especially the rants. Yes some of them might be a little exaggerated, but they are still an accurate representation of the college to a good degree\nâ””â”€â”€ People in BMS enjoy their college life to the fullest. PES is just managed badly"
