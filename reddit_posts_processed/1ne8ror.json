At least thatâ€™s what I did was when I was interviewing and stuff. Donâ€™t sweat it too much and good luck with the placements :)\nâ””â”€â”€ Adding to this: yes they internally do track which companies you registered and gave the OA for. At the end of the semester, just claim attendance for those slots. Although, this isn't an invite to scam attendance because they have the data to tally against lol"
