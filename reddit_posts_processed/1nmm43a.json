  "content": "The events of last night have led me to conclude that honest facts about our community are not entertained, which is blatantly wrong. Yes, Mayur and SaiRishi are the two most annoying idiots this college has to offer. I'll say it a billion times. If they can't accept the fact and want to \"find\" who posted it and \"beat\" them up, then that just shows why they're being hated in the first place. Genuinely, learn some civic sense and learn to take some criticism without running to your mommies. Womp womp. 🙂",

They're hated yes, and if they put even a fraction of effort that they wanna put towards \"finding and beating\" the guy who made the post, into self-reflection and actually analyse their behaviors of why they act the way they do, it would do them so good. To Mayur, don't think of urself as a rowdy or don, if u truly didn't give \"two fucks\", u wouldnt have gone around and announced that u wanna beat people up. Take some constructive crisitism man, it's 2 of u vs the whole batch. Fix ur behavior, talking rudely to teachers who r just doing their jobs isn't cool. No one's gonna praise u for it nor gonna appreciate ur balls, ur behavior is disgusting and honestly repelling. It's honestly surprising how yall don't learn even after so many people speak against ur behavior\n├── Valid\n└── man everyone in our batch hated those clowns someone had to start the conversation and that happened yesterday which gave us some facts about them as conclusion\n    └── Yeah but these knuckleheads still don't get it, he wants to \"beat\" that guy up, like that would make people like him more.
