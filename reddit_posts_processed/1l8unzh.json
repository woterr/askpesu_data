So it wouldn't make sense to attend the kcet counselling PES is conducting if i already did the mains one?\n├── You'll get the answer on the registration page itself, if you still have any doubt you can ask me or make a post here \n│   └── Nah cause actually they said 45% is for jee/kcet quota, so like 324 seats out of 720 (for cse in rr),  so wouldn't it be half for mains and half for kcet but during mains counselling they showed all 324 available, so like then what is left for kcet quota then?\n│       └── Honestly I'm not sure about this , please make an post \n│           └── I tried making one, but they are not even allowing me to type the word \"mains\" ffs\n│               └── Did it for ya , check my last post \n│                   └── Thanks!!\n└── I wouldn't recommend"
