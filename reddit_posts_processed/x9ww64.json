And there are youtubers will million followers who say \"CS is CS\". So confused (and a bit scared). Had BITS score been good enough to confidently say I'd get ECE, probably would not have asked :-)\n    â”œâ”€â”€ Bhai esa kuch nahi he , Unless u wanna go cs ms right after btech or ur passionate about doing cs only ( most of the course isn't relavent for IT jobs ull be self studying anyway) , it is utter foolishness to compromise on tier 1 University for just the cse tag , esp if it's pes and bits circuital ur comparing , bits is saal ka avg 30lpa he lmao if u get circuital just go for it , the exposure and peer quality over ther is also much better than this place , however this place isn't so bad too (I'm a fresher) , u just need to find the rite ppl and ther r lots of exciting activities on campus , but i would take bits EEE over this place any day if I had the chance for a multitude of reasons\n    â””â”€â”€ Also talk to actual bits alums/seniors and pes cs seniors and basically someone in real life before making these decisions, ytubers nd reddit is NOT where u should be making life decisions"

Should I take it?\n\nI donâ€™t really have any particular interest in any branch, my decision would be purely based on placements and enjoyment for 4 years\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Continue with cse at PES.\nâ””â”€â”€ Placements - go with CSE.\nEnjoyment - well, the crowd we were with was chill. Hopefully that continues. Apart from that the curriculum is hectic.\n    â”œâ”€â”€ Crowd goals <3\n    â””â”€â”€ You graduated from the EC campus?\n        â””â”€â”€ Yes.\n            â””â”€â”€ Cool, Iâ€™ll probably stick with pes.when I counted the cutoffs compared to previous years Itâ€™s actually kind of unlikely that I can make the cutoff for bits. Just want to be prepared to make a decision if I get it"
