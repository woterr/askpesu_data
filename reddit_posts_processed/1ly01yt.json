  "content": "Hey folks, I'm currently planning to do Capstone in the space of Medical Image/Video Processing or Time-Series Analysis of Medical data. The volume of data in these domains are massive, spanning from 20-30 GB.  I want you to ask, whoever has worked on such a large-scale ML project, how could they run these on their systems for Capstone?  What systems/laptops did you use? What was your approach towards training these? I currently have an Intel Ultra 9 185H CPU with Intel Arc Graphics. Do you think I can run these locally? ",
