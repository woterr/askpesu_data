      "body": "A MacBook should work fine. Although you *might* face some issues:\n* I remember a few courses required installing software that wasn't completely compatible/available and people with Macs faced issues. I am not sure if these have been resolved, but this is probably the biggest issue that you can run into. But for these as well, there are workarounds (not fixes) but are difficult to resolve\n* If you get into ML, you *might* face a little difficulty running things locally at an acceptable level. But this is a tiny issue, it won't stop you from getting the work done, just not effectively\n\nI'd suggest sticking with your MacBook for now. You shouldn't face any difficulty until third year at least.\n\nEdit: I realised now that you asked whether you should install windows and not buy windows lol. It's upto you, but IMO first wait and see if at all it is needed\n└── So for now should I just take my mac to college without installing windows right?\n    └── Yup."
