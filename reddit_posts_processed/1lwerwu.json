      "body": "Hi u/EasternBench988, your post was temporarily held for moderator review because it mentions topics related to admissions, which automatically flags it for review. \n\nPosts involving admissions are treated with particular care on this subreddit due to the high potential for misinformation during high-stress times of counseling, seat allotment and critical decision-making periods.\n\nUnfortunately, we've seen how easily inaccurate or speculative advice spreads in such environments. Users frequently make major decisions about their future based on what they read online, often from fellow aspirants who may not have access to accurate information. This leads to confusion, false expectations, and in many cases, regret. Since this is the first year PES is using JEE and CET for admissions, the risk of misinformation is even greater and there simply isn't enough reliable historical data for anyone to make trustworthy predictions or statements.\n\nFor these reasons, all posts that fall under the category of admissions must go through moderator review and fact-checking before they are visible to the community. This is not meant to restrict discussion but to ensure that the advice shared here is grounded in verified knowledge and does not unintentionally mislead other students. Posts that speculate on admission procedures, branch allocation, share personal rank-based predictions, or solicit counseling advice from the crowd will generally not be approved, unless they clearly offer helpful, factual insights without creating confusion.\n\nIf you're looking for real data, refer to this post: [Which branch can I get? (PESSAT 2022 cutoffs)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/1ct5ujc/which_branch_can_i_get_at_no_dont_make_such_posts/)\n\nWe appreciate your understanding and cooperation. These policies are designed to protect not just you, but the entire community, from the harm that misinformation can cause during such a critical time. Please respect the rules and seek guidance from trusted sources. Attempts to bypass this filter may result in a 30-day ban or longer for repeat offenders.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

      "body": "yes its same.  but now they postponed the kcet pes.   \ninstead its JEE PES round 2 will be held.    \nso be ready for JEE PES Round 2\n└── Wait so help me out are there seats reserved equally for both the kcet pes counselling and jee pes counselling like 40 percent is through general counselling is 30 percent saved for jee pes and 30 for jee cet counselling or are they just giving all seats available for jee counselling and remaining for cet because i saw the cutoffs even at 80 and below percentile aiml in ec campus was available which is insane to think of\n    └── not much exact info available on this. my guess is only 5% seates for KCET PES (as already 40% is available through KEA KCET).  \nso 40-45% seats will be done through JEE  PES.  \nNo clear info but this is my guess based on round 1 counselling and the seats filled till now.  \nnote:  10-15% for mangement quota."
