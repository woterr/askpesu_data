      "body": "If you're academic, the college has a lot to offer. The college has good opportunities for you to do your own thing. Don't expect some beautiful fancy campus here. Don't expect a campus at all, it's a construction site rn. \nMost professors are great, the management is kinda annoying and will get on your nerves. \nThe college will be very supportive if you want to do things like research, entrepreneurship, and so on.  \nThis is however a university and they are governed by the laws that they make. The support for research and entrepreneurship is department wise, mainly depending on your HoD. You will have endless assignments and high attendance requirements. If you're looking at placements after your undergraduate, you will have a smooth ride if you're looking at IT/CS. \nTLDR - come to PESU if your primary goal is to study, as this place works like a school."
