Many report that some shifts are pretty difficult or very unnatural in selection of questions. Your scores will be normalised anyway before assigning a rank, so no point thinking too much about it.\n│       └── thanks mate for the info\n├── Dude should we do the deleted portions in chemistry like S block, Hydrogen, Solid state etc. for Pessat?\n└── Was chemistry and physics easy atleast?\n    └── yeah physics was flooded with electrodynamics and it was easy with some moderate questio and chem was the easiest ig\n        └── Good to know\nAiming for 45 for phy and 50 for chem+eng\nDunno about maths will be lucky of I get 30"

I don't recall how the calci was during pessat but it helped out a lot tho . I literally was able to finish chem numericals in 20-30 sec due to the calci."
