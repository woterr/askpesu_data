It still depends a lot on your resume (not only marks), the interview, opportunities, job market and luck. \n\nHow much is the management quota right now?\n\nBut if not management at PES, are you able to get into any other college? BMS, MRSIT?\n└── yes i am going for CS,working my ass off like the same as jee prep?or more?\n\ncurently the management quota is 12lakhs but ig it better than paying 7lakhs for ECE rigth?\n\nAs my comedk didnt go as expected BMS AND MRSIT ARE ON THE OTHER ISDE SOO NOPE MOSTLY and also BMS AND MSRIT my parents didnt like it much.\n    ├── Engineering is not the same as studying books 24x7 \nYou need to be genuinely committed to projects and assignments. You need to have a good balance of street smart + book smart. I did my BTech in PES and went to NITK for MTech and let me tell you, I saw that the toppers in both colleges just studied their asses off but never really liked what they were studying so both places they got shitty jobs. \n\nUnless you truly like the subject, and you feel like you can work in the domain for the rest of your life, it ain't worth it. If say, take a while to personally discuss this with some seniors and see how it goes before taking the decision.\n\nWhat's the reason to not like any other college though? I mean your main criteria should be the way things are taught and placement statistics. (Genuinely asking this because they were my other top choices after PES when I finished 12th, don't know what's changed)\n    │   └── thank youu fr the advice mate.\n\ni mean my parents had bmsce in their minds but not msrit. Recently my mom went to bmsce and she thougth that it wasnt jus too strict abt their curriculum.\n    └── PESU management is 12L only ?\n        └── Per year fees that is \n            └── Lmfao.\n                └── What u studying btw"

DONT, wait for comedk/kcet and see if you get something\n    ├── Even for 12 lakhs I don't see how it can be remotely worth it, not everyone gets a high salary here, and in the future, there is only more uncertainty with the rise of AI to replace jobs. Maybe if you are really passionate about CS, then joining here won't be that bad, but if you join purely with the intention to just make money, then nope, don't come here, it is better exploring other avenues, you'll be filled with regrets just like I did after 3 years of being here.\n    │   └── not really into CS jus doing it cause uk getting along the ratrace.\n\nsoo what are the other avenues you would suggest?\n\nwhat are the regerts you had?if you can expalin it too me i would try and discuss with my parents.\n\nthank you\n    │       └── I just didn't like development, the subjects here didn't interest me enough, combined with the fact that most of the faculty is really bad at teaching. If I was in your place, I would spend 1 year preparing to get into merchant Navy through DNS. It's just a one year course after which you start earning. The pay is really good in the long run, decent even in the earlier stages as all income is tax free.

      "body": "Mate, it's gonna depend purely on u. I know a guy who got in through management like 10 years ago (the fee for management was prolly 5 lakhs per annum back then which is basically pessat fee rn) who made it even tho he got in through management. He's in san francisco now, working at Microsoft, he completed his master's from UCLA last year. But I also know ppl who got in through management seat who r jobless, and these failure stories are a lot more than success stories so keep that in mind. If u wanna work ur ass off, it's a good place and at the end of the day it's all gonna depend on u. If u wanna pursue ur masters abroad then joining top institutes like RV, PES or BMS  is crucial. Applications from wackass institutes like Jyoti n Sambhram n all, good universities abroad won't even give u a chance, so keep that in mind too.\n├── No I disagree, foreign universities don't care about Jyothi v pesu, if it's iit,bits or nit it makes a difference.\nBeing the top in your college matters when u are applying for masters\nI'm talking with few examples in mind.\n│   └── Ure wrong. I personally know the college topper from Jyoti who passed out as the best outgoing student, had the highest cgpa in the college, had a job that paid her 20+ lpa but struggled to get a seat abroad, they got all of their applications rejected the first attempt she applied and only got into 1 or 2 colleges the next year when they applied again. Colleges look at the alumni of the undergrad college and how they have performed there, that explains the vast majority of ppl who go to universities like CMU, UCLA etc\n\nTrust me, they do care. I have family who work in Tesla, Microsoft etc so I know what I'm talking about\n│       └── I know, the best outgoing student from Jyothi get an admission in TU Munich (best uni in Germany) with scholarship. I also have family who work at Amazon and Microsoft in Seattle and San Francisco. So even I know what I'm talking about. One of my cousins completed her bteh in global academy of technology and went to njit. So yeah..\n│           └── Buddy u ain't proving anything by sharing a miracle story. To say that it doesn't matter at all is just appalling and wrong. U need to look into the number of ppl getting into good colleges abroad from PES and the number of ppl getting into good colleges from Jyothi. In the year 2023, jyothis best package was a package of 80k per annum in the US, ull need to live on the streets to make that work. Many average students who go abroad right after their bachelors from PES easily make 100k+.\n│               └── Nah bro, you're fundamentally wrong, maybe the person who you know, had bad SOP. I know many success stories of people from many different backgrounds. And pls be a little more respectful.\nAll I'm saying is you need to be in the top 20-30% wherever u do ur btech.\n└── abroad is the plan,but what if we are just an average student or maybe above average?then is it a good place to go with?\n\nthank you for the advice.\n    └── Dude if you wanted to make the choice to come here, you would have done it by now. I was in the exact same place as you. My parents also said the same thing.. they're like.. you have the opportunity, why don't you want to take it. So yeah, sometimes I wish I could stand up to them and tell No back then. Ultimately it's your choice. But if you do come here.. study well and fight for every mark..\n        └── still  discussing with my parents really confused and also my kcet went above avg soo expecting decent rank and also merit seat hopefully."

I have faced this. I am telling this without even considering all the money I have paid. Parents don't get it, they'll get wowed by all the infrastructure and bs, trust me it's all a facade, when u have a gpa of 7 it'll be horrible, you won't get short listed for anything and ur peers in other colleges can easily maintain a gpa of 8.5+\n└── but what if we are an above average student like i personally scored 91%ile in jee mains and after that i jus prepared for kcet. can i still be in the competion if i wanted to like comepting with the top 30% of the ppl as you said so?\n\nwill discuss with my parents and update y'all\n    └── Bmsce is also good.
