U get few holidays  here and there between the semester too like 2 days for Diwali and dussehra. And for first year u can use the amaatra gym for free afaik but it's really small, but the ec campus gym is great but u have to pay for it\n├── thts wt i needed thnx a lot man\n└── Does PES College have holidays on Saturday\n    └── Yes, but u might have 1-2 hrs online classes for 1 or 2 credit subjects"
