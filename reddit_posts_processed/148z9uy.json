OP is referring to the summer courses (I hope), not the backlog course exams that occur in the summer. These courses are for those who want to take more courses or want to ease the workload later. You will in all likelihood have to take up a couple of courses in the 7th semester. If you take 2 now, you can reduce the number of courses you take in that semester, thus giving yourself more time for Capstone, placements etc.\n\nu/Enough_Interest_5951 these courses are indeed useful, and some tend to be interesting as well. They also last 5 days exactly. They are \\*definitely\\* worth taking up.\n    ├── Oh okay thanks a lot will surely take this summer !\n    └── Which would you recommend"
