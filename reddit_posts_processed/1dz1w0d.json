Back then in my time the last ECE chosen by a student with 9.2 CGPA\n└── So do you think I should take the risk and gamble or look for some other clg?\n    └── Pretty risky, it isn't easy to get a 9+ GPA\n        └── Ik that but I just want a guarantee that I will be able to switch to ece if my gpa is 9+\n            ├── There is no guarantee. It depends on the number of seats AND your performance. So even if you perform well and there are like 2 seats, you don't really have much chance.\n            └── some of my friends were able to change from eee to ece with just 7.3"
