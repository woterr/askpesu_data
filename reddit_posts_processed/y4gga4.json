Seeing drop in ComedK cutoffs ,sure Kcet cutoffs will also drop (being the last counseling happening), you may go for top 5 colleges CS/IT branches also.\n├── Same with me, hope to get cse ecity with 2.4k rank\n└── Can you connect me to any EEE major? I know peeps from CS and ECE... Only intention behind my post is to save bucks for masters abroad... Looking at the placements data, Many companies have allowed circuital branches to sit for placements, cgpa required is arnd 8... and they have been offered decent package and internships too!"

Are both of them different?\n├── Officially it's AIML but syllabus wise you will have to check with the students( like if it's 90% CS with AI subjects or if it leans more towards AI)\n\nNot only in PESU..but in other colleges too when you see namewise there's a distinction between CS (specialisation in AI/DS/Cyber) and *just* AIML.\n\nFor example I think ramaiah has both CS-AI and AI. Someone cmiiw.\n│   └── Yes MSRIT has both...that's what intrigues me. It doesn't make sense for both the courses to be same... and if the aiml course at msrit is not about specialization then other colleges would also have it the same way.\n├── Aiml\\* my bad!\n├── hey hold on... Just checked my profile... It is CSE in AiMl\n│   └── Can you compare your syllabus with cse student and clarify whether aiml is specialization or it's aiml in detail... atleast in kcet option entry it's being shown aiml, so it wouldn't make sense to have different course for only kcet students.\n│       └── Only this year AIML got added so no one knows how it's syllabus will be.\n\nWhen I attended the pessat  counselling, it was written AIML.

I've corrected it now👍\n└── My father had talked to the councelling staff during PESSAT round 1 and they had told him that it's CSE+AIML specialization. Even though it hasn't been written this way anywhere, they had told him that it is a CSE degree but with specialization. Not sure if it still holds the same, but this was the information conveyed to him back then.\n    └── [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QmnTQzQX3E1vMK2pRXJZqkwKV98hiAGz/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QmnTQzQX3E1vMK2pRXJZqkwKV98hiAGz/view?usp=sharing)\n        └── Yeah, exactly what I've meant in my reply above.\n            └── Till the announcement of commencement of Kcet option entry , in my profil it said AI&ML, now its changed to CSE-AiMl\n                └── In my opinion, they're giving CSE degree with AIML specialization."

You can always make the money back, you should prioritise your interest first.\n\nThat being said, EEE is known to be much harder and if you're someone who doesn't like the course in general then you'll struggle with it. There are far lesser opportunities, and even if you do end up doing a CS minor, companies still do prefer a CS degree over an EEE + Minor in CS degree (I answered this in detail in a previous post, you can check it out). \n\nIf you want to have better opportunities (and also pursue your interest which seems to be CS) then you should stick to what you have. CS placements are really good, you can make the money back soon (if that is your concern).\n└── This time eee cutoff was 46xx in mock round"
