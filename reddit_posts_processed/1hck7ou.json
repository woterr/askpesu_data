      "body": "Most people don't get a summer internship. It does make things easy if you get one and a PPO through that but it isn't strictly necessary and even okay if you don't bag one. Don't stress over it. \n\nAnd yeah, T1 might not be the easiest but it's not impossible. Try to get it above 8 so that you can at the very least sit for most companies. 8.5+ is ideal though.\n└── I did calculate and I cant get it to 8.5 even with two 10's and its looking very bleak for an 8 too might be around the border or exactly 8 so i might be cooked😔\n    └── No, you're still okay. You might not get placed right away but you should be able to eventually. 8+ is still okay enough."

Im just worried about T1 placements tbh😭\n    └── Dw bruh!\nYou are doing great by having 8 CGPA at 6 th sem ,\n\nYou do have a lot of scope to get placed in a T1 Company , you just have to concentrate on building skills which is very much imp to placement’s !!\n\n\nSo yea ATB :)\n        └── Hopefully I get it up to 8😭"

Have some faith, lock in, and don’t give up.\n└── Wait 2025 placements or the one before that?😭  \nPS : Thank you for lifting the mood up a lil\n    └── 2024 batch, and honestly, I feel the placement scene was much tougher during our time. Also, keep in mind that many companies will have that 8+ CGPA criteria, don’t let that demotivate you. Just make sure that when your time comes, you make it count.\n        └── Yessir"

I have a friend of mine who got placed in consecure with a cgpa of 7.8 recently and i know a lot of them getting 10-11 lpa companies with cgpa around 7 and above. Since u say u can solve medium to high level dsa q's cracking the coding round would be easy. if not u can use ai to get ur answers and try to make sure u have a good resume as they usually shortlist based on it and shld be able to explain the projects in the interview round .If ur aiming for high t1 companies then u'll have to improve ur gpa to 8.5+.\n└── Ohh okay makes sense thank you"
