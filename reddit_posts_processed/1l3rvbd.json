Just get on LinkedIn, pick a uni, search using \"<uni PES University\" as a query. You'll see how long the list can be. \n\nSaying PES has no international recognition at all is absolutely false. It's definitely no IIT, but we've got a solid presence abroad.\n    â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ You yourself know the answer then why asking the question, from your comments it's already clear that you're backing thapar so go thapar\n    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ 91 perc pe aiml milega bi nhi dw\n    â”‚           â””â”€â”€ 22xx rank hai 100 percent milega dada ..\n    â”‚               â””â”€â”€ Last year 2600 Passat rank gets it â€¦ this year jee seats will add up\n    â”‚                   â””â”€â”€ Fair, then it depends on u lol, placements are same check the distance and join the one nearest to u\n    â””â”€â”€ Do you realise that avg placement is less than your fees ðŸ’€\n        â””â”€â”€ Fact check : Thapar fees 35 payback period 2 yrs with 18 lpa (considering myself above average \nBITS fees 36 payback 1.75 yrs\nPESU fees 24.00 payback 2 yrs ( for someone average )\nTo kya realise karna hai ??? Faltu ka gyan and â€¦ my fatherâ€™s income is more than 1 crpa so hardly matters to me .ðŸ’€\n            â”œâ”€â”€ The world is at Sharda..where r you\n            â””â”€â”€ Sry man you could get any seat didn't know your game go ahead ig ðŸ˜¦ðŸ˜¦"
