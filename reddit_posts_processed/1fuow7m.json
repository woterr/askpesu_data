Clubs help you indirectly by helping you network with similar-minded people and provide you with a platform to develop your soft skills. Taking part in club events will also expose you to various niches, which may or may not benefit you - depends on whether you *individually* pursue those niches. Just attending events and being in a club adds zero value because no company or admission board will be impressed by seeing \"X club, PES University\" on your resume.\n├── hmmm ok...which technical club is good?\n│   └── What is your interest? based on that, u can join a club\n│       └── so basically i was bio student till 12th so idk shit ....i'm yet to figure out my interests\n│           └── Ok, figure it out and join whichever club you like\n└── yo u know u could have atleast listed some functioning technical clubs man, u just started stringing him out lmao"
