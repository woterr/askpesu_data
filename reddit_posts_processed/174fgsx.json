      "body": "there are several types of hackathons, if it is a competitive programming-esque hackathon then youâ€™d probably need to know more than the basic dsa taught in school. \n\nthere are hackathons where you have a develop the prototype for a product, for which you would need to understand the usage of several external libraries (and even programming languages apart from python). \n\nessentially- i donâ€™t think that what you learnt in school will be enough for hackathons, but will be helpful in the sense that you have the foundation for the language, which would make learning external libraries easier."
