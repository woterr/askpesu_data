Since you're getting them for the same fees, you should go for PES(unless you have a specific problem with the E-City location)\n├── Bro what about CS (aiml) rr campus or cse at ec campus???what should I choose?\n│   └── [https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/yker4v/aiml\\_in\\_pes\\_rr\\_campus\\_or\\_cse\\_in\\_pes\\_ec\\_campus/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/yker4v/aiml_in_pes_rr_campus_or_cse_in_pes_ec_campus/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nIt's an old thread, but it deals with the same question as your's\n│       └── But it's about aiml vs cse , this year it's not just aiml but cs+aiml. So what is better in that ?\n│           └── bruh, it was always CS(AIML) only, probably the OP in the other post didn't type it properly. It's been only one academic year since that post, PES doesn't change programmes so fast.\n│               └── But in last year kcet pdf it was mentioned as only artificial intelligence\n└── Like travel is not a problem as I am not from Bangalore anyways.\n    └── Then, from what I've gathered from this subreddit, you should prefer CS in EC campus"
