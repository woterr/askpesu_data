      "body": "A minor is a course in a stream other than the one you are in, like ECE students take CSE minors( it is totally optional). You can opt for this out of sheer interest but mostly non-CSE students take this to be able to sit for placements with CSE students for software roles.\nSpecial topics are 2 credit courses offered from the second year. You have generally 3/4 options to choose from. You can do it in the summer or during the regular semester, it is usually on mondays or fridays for around 2 hours and for a week if you opt for it in the summer. You have to take one special topic every semester.\nFrom the third year every semester two four credit courses can be chosen according to your interest or want of a specialization. This is compulsory.\nAlso stop stressing. As you get to it you'll understand. It's not as complicated as you think it is.\n└── Tq bro✌️✌️"
