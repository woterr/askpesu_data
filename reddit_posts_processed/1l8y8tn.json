Rr cse has 720 seats, out of which 45% is for jeem(324) and same 45% is for kcet(324), the left out 10%(72) seats are management.jeem counselling has been done and kcet is yet to be done.\n├── So if you fill through both , you get seat from the pool through which you are eligible right?\n│   └── Nah if u get a seat thru jeem and after kcet counselling if u get the same seat it will be converted to kcet seat\n│       └── Thank you so much 🙏🏼\n├── Nope what u are telling is wrong …\n\nTo join pes there are 4 options.\n\n1.\t⁠⁠Government seats (40%): This is through KCET counselling only and the fee structure is according to KCET 2025 .\n2.\t⁠⁠JEE mains quota : You can join through this if ur jee mains percentile is high enough .( not sure about how much u need cuz it’s the first year of admissions held this way ) The fees will be 5L for cs related , 4.5 for ece and 4 for other branches (per year fees)\n3.\t⁠⁠KCET quota : if ur KCET rank is high enough can get through this ….This option mainly people will use if their rank is not high enough to get through KCET counselling but is still a decent rank , fees is similar to jee mains quota.\n4.\t⁠⁠Management quota (15% seats): self explanatory …highest amount of fees ,not sure how much tho.\n\nJee mains and KCET quota combined have 45% seats . If u are sure u are getting pes through the KCET counselling u can still participate in the pes counselling and get a seat there and block it just for safey and wait until the KCET counselling finishes ….then u can get the refund of the blocked seat and join through KCET counselling which will have lower fees.Similar strategy if u have not done well in KCET but have decent mains score.\n│   └── This is something new i heard.Not sure abt it\n│       └── I got it from their website itself ….the only confusing part is how come they gave away all 324 seats to pesu jee counselling when they still had pesu KCET counselling remaining ….the other 40% will only be given by kea through the actual KCET counselling ….so no idea what pes is planning\n└── Then what is left for through karnataka govt counselling? Isn't 40% reserved for that? \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7esrs73z7c6f1.png?width=1422&format=png&auto=webp&s=d92ed68ae4c4c726c5dee9b9a0ba18b0ad58bc45\n    └── Ig this is something new they are doing, no idea!!"
