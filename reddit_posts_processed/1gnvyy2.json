The stalls were good (ngl, would have been nice if they were a bit cheaper tho) . The activities were sick as well.   \nThanks to everyone who made Maaya possible. ",

That's why the food brands have to charge higher than their actual mrp for those same products. But the difference is quite nominal I believe.\nâ””â”€â”€ yeah it is understandable, just said it would have been nice if they were cheaper.\n    â””â”€â”€ Fairs"
