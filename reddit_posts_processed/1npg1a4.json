  "content": "I’m an MCA first-year student, just 3 days into college. During orientation they mentioned all the facilities, but honestly, the campus feels a bit big and complicated to me right now.\n\nI’m especially curious about **clubs** – how do I find out which clubs are there, what’s the process to join, and what’s it usually like being in one?\n\nAlso, side note – I still haven’t got my SRN number, and I don’t know how to access the campus WiFi yet. If anyone can guide me on that too, it would be great.",
