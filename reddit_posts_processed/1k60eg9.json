      "body": "I have interned at CoDmav previously and its strictly offline , we have 2 attendance check points , one at morning 9 30 and another one is at 4 30 or 5 , During the internship , Honestly everyone would do just 20% work and 80 just chill or chit-chat / talk , over a period of 2 months they put it 20% of work everyday and get some reasonable project and publish it to some conference.\n\nHowever there is very less learning as ppl dont tend to put in 100% efforts.\n├── So is it not worth and we can do DSA in that time?\n│   └── Like if you have any projects to put on resume, and like and pretty good with ML projects and stuff or  ot interested in it then leave it, if you are in 2nd year it will jus give you an essence of doing a project under teachers and it Ll depends on your mentor if it's charu then you are in great hands\n└── how hard is it to get in like interview and stuff if i have a decent knowledge related to data science?"
