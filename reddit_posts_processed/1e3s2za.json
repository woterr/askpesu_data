Worth it.\n└── Is it necessary???can we do projects based on this???what about it's importance for placement\n    └── Yes it is necessary. Yes you can do projects based on this. Treat this as a subject more than opportunity for placement because there are several other factors involved in placement.\n        └── Ayo is it possible for me to dm u personally to know more about the subject....I didn't understand what u mean other factors involved?\n            └── Other factors meaning I meant this subject alone won't give you an edge over your placements. If you want to pursue cybersecurity sure you can take up this subject along with computer network security."
