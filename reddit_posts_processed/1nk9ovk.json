      "body": "Last year they had an extra assignment for people who did not finish in time or people who copied.\n\nIf you had copied from someone else then you wouldn't get the full 10 marks, but like only 8 ( I forgot exactly).\n\nIf you didn't copy, but failed to submit in time, then you could write the assignment and claim the entire 10 marks.\n\nI don't know if you guys will also have a re-test but if you do then you have a chance to make up for it. Try to finish the assignment on your own and understand exactly how it works. Don't use AI or anything because then you will not learn.\n├── But guess what? The TAs themselves were using LLMs to solve people's queries today lol and then instructing based on it\n│   └── Bruh TAs, from what i've observed, are often just as clueless as the students are. I’m not in BD but every time I ask them something, they just shrug and tell me to GPT it. I dont blame them bc i get that it's a tough spot for them but still… lol.\n│       └── This is actually true. Most of the TAs are completely clueless about the assignment themselves. Im pretty sure it would be like one person who is making the assignments and the others just go with the flow\n└── ahh okayy, but today they literally said we can use AI , thanks tho!\n    └── I mean you can use AI, but don't use it for the main logic. \n\nLike just write out the main logic of the code and ask the AI to make it more efficient or remove redundant lines, etc\n        └── Oh okayy , Thanks a lot !!!!!! 🙏🙏"
