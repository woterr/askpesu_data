And yes, people who drop out do have to pay a pretty high fee, even more if you are a PESSAT kid.\n└── Because even RV does this shi so will probably other clg....\n    └── Sir, it's a University specific thing. Always do your research before committing. RV has tie ups with German Uni's for Mechatronics if I'm not wrong, PESU has no such thing (that I am aware of at least). If you're planning to leave at the end of first year, you'll be given 0 credit transfers and will need to pay a very exorbitant fee. Good luck.\n        └── Thank you for your response ...  I acknowledge that this maybe a subjective topic with respect to each university but it seems that most University do this unfortunately ... Irrespectively thank you ..."
