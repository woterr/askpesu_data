Ignore, the quality of courses is crap too.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ No like the courses are very much required since they provide credits towards your degree. Our professors said we need 8 credits extra to finish our bachelor's\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ The ones taught by students don't give you credits, the ones taught by teachers are again optional. Talking them allows you to skip a subject later, but that's all.\nâ”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ No, in my course it's not that way at all. I'm asking about the skill enhancement courses that are required for the credits needed to do the honours degree. If I want general then I won't do it but I want to do that fourth year\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ Also the skill enhancement courses were never taught by students.\nâ””â”€â”€ It's not taught by students.. mostly it's taught by the teachers only and if u take these courses now then u can peacefully utilise 7th sem for placements without talking any special topics (if u have covered 6 credits from these skill enhancement course)"

If I want an honours degree I have to do these for extra credits"
