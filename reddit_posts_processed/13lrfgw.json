If you don't like hostel you can move out after a year (or sooner if you're desperate and can make the necessary arrangements)\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Is youtube and reddit blocked?\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Youtube runs on a restricted version in which most of the videos and recommendations are blocked .\nReddit afaik videos are blocked on it.\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ ðŸ˜”\nâ””â”€â”€ Yeah, adding to this, hostel is pretty assðŸ˜‚ but Iâ€™ve made the closest friends of my life and a lot of our enjoyment involved evading hostel rules so join it keep an open mind and try to enjoy yourself."
