This is what they told ->\n\nA letter has to be written to the HOD of the concerned department, explaining why the CC is required and why it wasn't collected previously. \n\nDepending on the HOD, an email may be sufficient.\n            └── I have DMmed u the Chairpersons number and email ID. Hope this helps.\n                └── Hey thanks a lot for helping me out man. \nReally appreciate it :)"
