Constitution of India and cyber laws - Unit 1 is done (3 more left)\n├── ok thanks, but could you tell me all the topics done in mechanics and electronics\n│   └── I can't tell the topics taught in mech even if I want to. I really don't know what's being taught. He just makes us solve some random problems in resolving force.\n\nEpd semiconductors unit is being taught. In that we just finished v/i characteristics of a diode and now we are solving circuit problems consisting of diodes.\n│       └── ok thanks man\n└── KCET R2 batch started on Sep 14 and very little has been covered so far\n    └── dude you got admission thru 2nd round right? what documents do you need to submit to the college?\n        └── I got seat in R1 but accepted and joined in R2.Pes website has list of docs- marks cards, Transfer certificate Admission order, fee paid reciept, Aadhar, 4 photos(passport and stamp size)\n            └── ok thanks i got it"
