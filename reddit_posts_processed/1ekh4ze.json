Rashmi N U - Very good\n└── May I know what courses that Prof. Sumanth and Prof Shashidhara handled previously for you?\n    └── Sumanth took Cryptography elective in 6th sem for me, he was bad there  \nShashidhara never took\n        └── Oh ok thanks..! Both of them teach well (just 4 classes are over) , and  SM is exceptionally good. So I belive it all depends on their expertise and experience."
