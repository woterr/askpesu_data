It may take effort to find them though, that's why some people may say such things if they don't want to put any effort.\n\n2. From my experience, making friends was super easy. There's tons of events and activities as well to help you socialize. In EC campus especially, people are quite friendly and chill. I've easily spoken to over 500 people at PES, and made many friends.\n\n>4yrs ka torture hota hai pura\n\nThat is unavoidable, PES tortures everyone. ğŸ™ƒ"
