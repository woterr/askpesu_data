Its okay, just study next time.  \n  \nQuestion wise difficulty is exactly same. Just 40/100 is passing marks.   \n  \nAs a tip i suggest going to your faculty, they will guide you. Don't shy away from them.\n└── High emphasis on last point, my professor gave me his own notes and made question bank himself for me. I not only passed but got better grade than the subjects i originally passed in."
