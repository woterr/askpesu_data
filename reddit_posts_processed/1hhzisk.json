Who told ?\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ 1) I heard jawahar himself said in orientation that they are reducing the pass marks\n2) many of friends said in ece orientation they've shown that 35 is passing marks\n \nBut I can't confirm both of these because I didn't see it myself\nâ””â”€â”€ Na it is what they claim it is but there's times when there's no ways in hell to get 40 and yet pass. Their grading system is funny asf\n    â””â”€â”€ I am referring to the pass mark when no modification is made to the grade mapping. Of course, there will be changes if they push it around. I am sure you will find the same grade mapping on the back of your grade sheet or transcript.\n        â””â”€â”€ Oh yes u are right"
