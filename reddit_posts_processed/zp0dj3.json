Some of them are actual books and some of them are photocopies which you can buy. At the end of the semester you could even sell it back to the campus Mart and get your money back. A lot of people preferred this option over the library.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Oh that's quite nice.... Thank you\nâ””â”€â”€ I don't see many people doing that (taking books from Campus mart ) these days....ðŸ˜…\n    â””â”€â”€ Could be due to lack of awareness or that these books are all available as soft copies online.\n        â””â”€â”€ Yeh"
