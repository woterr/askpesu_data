      "body": "RR campus have 3 messes\n\n**Food court**: Its the best among the 3. There's a booking system for mess in which you'll have to book your respectable mess by providing a priority order. Food court usually fills up the fastest there's might be a change you won't get food court if you book late.\n\nThe breakfast, dinner and snacks are usually good. In dinner you'll 2 times chicken in a week and the food is north indian. You'll get eggs 2 times a week as well. But the food here is repetitive usually.\n\n**Namdhari**: Here also the food is north indian here and it's pure veg. The food here isn't that much repetitive as compared to food court but the food taste is like a typical mess. It's manageable not that good not that bad.\n\n**Hostel mess**: It's basically the south indian version of namdhari. Here you'll get chicken 2 times a week in dinner as well. It's usually is the least in demand. The breakfast here though is the best."
