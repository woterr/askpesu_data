  "content": "Warning: this is very long and very over dramatic \n\n\nI'm a management quota CS fresher , I dint come to first round because I thought my rank was useless , but now I found out i could have gotten ECE in RR and i have  a rlly good chance for CS in EC campus, but here's the thing, im super confused about what to do..\n\n\nLeaving for EC campus would mean leaving my single mum for herself which I'm really really uncomfortable doing because we are fresh out of a lot of family trauma , and i rlly want to stay in RR , the campus is beautiful and the environment is very motivating other than that  even financially and practically it doesn't make too much sense to go to EC campus because I would have to pay for that shitty hostel , eat 4yrs of mess food , pay for travels... Whereas here i can just walk to clg , eat good food and stay with my mum for an extra 2-3lakhs a year and I'm getting those scholarships forsure so even that wouldn't matter from the second year , \n\n\nNow taking ECE in RR is something I've pretty much discarded and only considering because of the paranoia, because I would bash my head off before solving another convoluted physics problem because thts y i flunked my entrances (98%ile in math and 57%ile phy in comedk) , I'm psychologically fed up with the subject and i wouldn't survive the ECE course , I'm good at visualising abstract math and im pretty sure i want math+ cs to be what i do in my future career...\n\n\nNow I've answered my own question here but I'm going paranoid thinking that I'm a complete idiot to choose to pay higher fee when you can get a merit seat , also u sorta get treated as a second class guy amongst your peers, which i sort of just accept stoically because I don't expect anyone to take the time to understand my pov of things, but I'm worried this may extend to other things as well ? Like does being a higher-fee guy affect the kindoff opportunities u get ? Like for placements/higher studies , or in general do i get looked down on too badly because of my entry quota ? Ik the answer is probably no \nbut I'm still super paranoid , so ig the whole point of this post is for someone to calm me the fuck down lol, I'm sorry for wasting your time \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTldr: As an RR higher-fee quota CS ,Confused bout practicalilty and/or getting the 'merit-student' brand",

It is fair game for placements, scholarships, clubs, etc. Tbh nobody even gonna ask you this shit after 3rd Or 4th sem, cuz it really doesn't matter. \n\nIn my experience, I highly doubt your peers will look down on you cuz of your quota. Anyone who does that in this day and age is a dick. At best you may get a \"oh damn rich boy\". \n\nCan't advise anything else given your circumstances. However, these are my two cents. \n\nAtb\nâ””â”€â”€ Thx man , rlly needed tht :)"

So many good and bad experiences ,that you will relish later. Rest upto you to decide. Chill\nâ””â”€â”€ I feel u bro ðŸ¥², but i think being with my mum is more important atm"

You would be saving money by choosing the merit seat. But again, would advise you to choose based on your priorities.\nâ””â”€â”€ Ye dude i get tht , i have a bit of fomo for  hostel Life as well , but i think being there for my mum is more imp rn , i was only concerned if it was idiotic to remain a management quota guy despite qualifying for a merit seat , but ig its just all tht toxic jee mindset thts messing me up nd nothing more"

Maybe you can also do that.\n\nAbout the placements opportunities and academics etc , the other guys are right. It's exactly the same as RR students will get (I've talked to 4th yr cse students of our campus undergoing placements and they too confirmed this). Here all the clubs are really active and conducting really interesting workshops hackathons every week. +if you want you can participate in EVERY EVENT that is happening in the RR campus (PESU provides buses for EC campus students to travel to RR campus for events anol). \n\nEC Campus is beautiful bro. It's 2x the size of RR campus. These gardens, greenery you won't find there. This campus is still behind RR Campus but the gap is reducing every day. For example they've already built a brand new MRD Student Centre which is nearly double the size of the RR campus one and infrastructurally it's stunning. There are many other perks too like less crowd(way lesser than RRðŸ’€)+availability of all that you'll need in a college. Most importantly the metro here. The construction is almost done and it's expected to be functioning by june of next year(after testing anol). My plan is to travel by metro itself after it gets built.\n\nRest is upto you. Take a chill pill"
