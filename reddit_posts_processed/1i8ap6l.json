      "body": "7 is actually good for first year but aim for higher sgpa from next sem and try to make your cgpa 8.5 or 8+ by third year to be eligible for almost all the companies along with this build your resume learn new skills decide the role that you want to get and according to that learn skills definitely you will get placed in a good company with decent package but don't worry about outcome now just focus on yourself. All the best 👍\n└── thank you"
