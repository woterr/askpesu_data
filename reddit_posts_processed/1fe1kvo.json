  "content": "Hey y'all, Would it be useful if there was an app that helps commuters connect with commuters, eg lets say I travel from Marathahalli To PES daily and my fuel expenses accounts to almost 200 everyday. And there is a guy who'd like to tag along with me for fuel sharing. Would this app be useful for people whose fuel expenses break their bank balances? Thank you",
