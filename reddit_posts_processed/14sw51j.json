      "body": "I'm not a PES student, was someone looking to join but didn't.\nImo the RR campus and EC campus are pretty similar. Both are in the same city, one in the outskirts and one within the city. Placements will also be centralised. The RR campus looked great(wrote exam there lol), but how much difference it has with the EC campus can be said by one of the students only. I'd suggest to go with the subject you like. College/campus would've mattered more when both the colleges were in different tiers.\n\nAll the best.\n└── Pretty much the advice I was looking for!!Thanks dude and all the best too in whichever clg u get into!!"
