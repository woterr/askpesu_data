  "content": "So my exam was at 12 and they let everyone in to the mech building at  â‰ˆ12:00 and i dont have a track of time after that but it took me a while after that to reach my exam room. They just gave us the answer booklet and sent us to our desk, and we hade to fill in details while the time was running out, by the time i started solving the time was already down to 50mins.   \nIs it always like this? Do u not get time before exam starts to fill in the details on the answer sheet?",

I thought that the timer starts when you start the exam......\nâ”œâ”€â”€ no i think it does start at same time for everyone, because everyone's paper ended at same time.\nâ””â”€â”€ No. If the exam is supposed to start at 12, the timer will start at 12. If you're late you lose time.\n    â””â”€â”€ what happens if you're early?\n        â””â”€â”€ It'll take you to a timer page and you wait till the exam starts.\n            â””â”€â”€ interesting, thanks!\n                â””â”€â”€ Man that's unfortunate. Especially for a subject like math where you need all the time you can get. Unfortunately this college is unpredictable and fucking hates us for some reason so expect the worst."

They should have given you guys extra time in that case to make up for it.\nâ”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ This was in ec btw\nI didn't wanna waste further time debating so didn't complain\nâ”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Nah I was just wondering because they always let us go early and give enough time before the exam starts to let us fill in details.\nâ”‚   â”‚           â””â”€â”€ They did not give us any time before it all all, and it was my first time so i was a bit unsure about what to fill, so it took away a decent amount of time.\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Should we complain to someone about this?\nâ”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ No action would be taken, they always let us in like 5 minutes early, I'm from ecc, just try being there like 5 minutes early.\nâ”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ i was at the mech entrance 20 mins early, they did not allow.\nâ”‚   â”‚           â””â”€â”€ Strange, try talking to the exam controller or your HOD if it happens again.\nâ”‚   â”‚               â””â”€â”€ I talked to the exam controller today, she was quite understanding ( did not expect her to talk so nicely) She said nothing can be done now, and that she will make sure it wont happen again.\nâ”‚   â”‚                   â””â”€â”€ People are nicer here in ecc, at least as of now\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ ideally in rr they let like 5-10 minutes before the paper starts\nâ””â”€â”€ I was on time, they did not let us in. I waited for nrly 20 mins outside mech building."
