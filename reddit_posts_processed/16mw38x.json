And I was one of the guys who shifted to aiml.\n\nA lot of my ec campus friends shifted to cs from ece. They didn't even get 8.\n            └── Im in EC ECE and what to switch to cs or aiml in rr or ec campus\n                └── You can definitely do it. \n\nJust keep your grades above 8.5 and you're guaranteed to get it by a long shot."
