IMO, if you *really* want to prepare for CS courses, brushing up on C, especially the latter concepts like data structures, will help you.\n└── But I'm doubtful that in worst case I won't get cs, and I would have wasted this month not doing anything for ece\n    └── What's your end goal? Are you looking for placements in core or IT? If you want to land and IT job, you're going to have to do DSA at some point anyway.\n        └── IT most probably, so yeah I should go for that\n            └── In that case, yes, look at DSA topics."
