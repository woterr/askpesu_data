But unless there is some amount of determination 'n' smart-work from your side, it will be difficult.   \nSo, just read the following according to me-\n\n1. Textbook - Mainly Arthur Beiser Book\n2. Slides and Notes (optional) \\[FYI, I really didn't like the slides much\\]\n3. Assignments & QB In PESU Academy \\[If you've got time left yet\\]\nâ””â”€â”€ Do we get mostly application based questions?\n    â””â”€â”€ Yes, there'll be, for ex the thought experiment (Gamma-ray)\n        â””â”€â”€ Thank you so much"
