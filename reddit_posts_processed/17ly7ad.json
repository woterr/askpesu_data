Because PES has good placements all the time\nâ””â”€â”€ This is 100% valid info , its sent by animesh giri , he teaches big data for 5th sem students and cn for 4th sem students and he is also the placement co ordinator for 2025 batch\n    â””â”€â”€ Is this data including ppos? u/Fun-Understanding862\n        â””â”€â”€ I asked one of my seniors, he said doreswamy showed 312 total T1 cse, in the stats provided here its given only 300. So i dont think so ppos are included in this.\n            â””â”€â”€ okay So do you rate this a Good Placement Session\n                â””â”€â”€ Given the  circumstances it can be called decent but in a normal market these are not quite good"

Considering it's only been a few months.\n        â””â”€â”€ PES usually reaches this number in late September or early October\n            â””â”€â”€ Ah, fair enough. So, it's not too bad unless you're the bottom of the stack, right?\n                â””â”€â”€ I mean yeah but stuff gets competitive when you are compeitng with 1000's of ppl unlike other colleges..so tensions are kinda high\n                    â””â”€â”€ Understandable. You guys have CGPA based cut-offs? How many of the 300 have a 9+, you think?\n                        â””â”€â”€ No idea abt that but i do know that there are a lot of 9 pointers left\n                            â””â”€â”€ I've taken enough of your time already. Thank you for answering my queries! Best of luck!\n                                â””â”€â”€ Haha np  :)"
