  "content": "I see many people panicking about whether they will get a seat in either of the campuses. I got allotted CSE at EC campus in KCET round 1. Are they panicking because they thought there would be more number of remaining seats in PESSAT round 2? Are they worried because they won't clear the cut-off in the round 2 PESSAT due to high demand for the low number of remaining seats? Will this be affecting me ( who has already been alloted CSE through KCET and is waiting for the next round allotment results) in any way? \nThe low number of seats remaining are for the people joining through PESSAT and not KCET, right?",
