Colleges don't compute weighted measures for these stats. Although I'd like to add that weighted measures would have been more accurate"

Can be automated to a large extent since college sends the same email to everyone. However, selected candidates are often explicitly informed after interviews. So getting details like \"shortlisted X+ GPA\" or \"N people selected\" cannot be automated unless the maintainer actively reaches out to people and asks for these, which understandably is very tedious and non-incentive if you're already placed.\n└── Nope, not possible. personally i tried to develop a custom script using Google App scripts, its very much impossible because the mail format changes everytime"
