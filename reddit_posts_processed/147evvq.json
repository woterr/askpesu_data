I've known people who've been allowed to write exams at 69%. but that's pushing your luck. regardless, the ugc guidelines for attendance are 75%. so PES lets you write exams even if your attendance is around or above the 75 cut off although they insist on 85 being the actual number.\n└── Ok thanks"
