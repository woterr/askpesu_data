Notice the lawn in front of MRD too :)\n\nYou can catch more glimpses of the old campus from the TAS Instagram page, these are some of the prominent ones: \n1. https://www.instagram.com/p/B0-HWlQDeJl\n2. https://www.instagram.com/p/B1fXfdoD4Ou\n3. https://www.instagram.com/p/BzV9p4WD24v\n\nI've got a lot more pictures in the archive, feel free to DM if anyone wants to see more.

We'd even joke that our summer internships would be at the digging site lmao.\n    â””â”€â”€ Our placements were there bro\n        â””â”€â”€ It was ready only in final year, so yes. But most of us had our placements virtually.\n            â””â”€â”€ Ya true true they should've left the campus as it was"
