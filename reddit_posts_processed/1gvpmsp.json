So if u get 29 on first and 35 on the second your final score is 29+35/2. "

If that total also yields a decimal number than it's rounded off to the next integer.\n└── Each component is scaled independently and then added. As TA, we used to calculate these.\n    ├── Bro can someone plz clear me the grading thing?\n    └── Thanks. Every teachee I've asked refused to say anything lol."
