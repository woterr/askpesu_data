  "content": "I got around 7k in CET \nI'm interested in taking up ECE. According to previous year cutoff in last round, I might easily get ECE as cutoff is like 12k\nIs there any chance cutoffs increase due to metro connectivity? I dunno but ig cutoffs are bit less due to location factor of it being far.\nWhat do you think?\n\nAsking this coz, I should decide on whether to apply through PESU quota(the one with 5L fees). If I can get through by CET itself, I might not. So I wanted your opinion.",
