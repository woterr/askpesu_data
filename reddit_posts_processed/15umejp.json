My question is i might get rv cs ds or cs cyber in 3 round is it worth taking a specialisation cs branch if its from rv given that i have the option of getting core in pes cs and bms cs .**\n\n**what are your thoughts on this?**\n\n**\"educational\\_info: kcet rank 15xx with hk qouta\"**",

PES will guarantee a good placement at the end of 4 years but building your profile will be an uphill battle amidst the poor management, mediocre faculty, lack of research outcomes and rigorous academic coursework. The branch however might lead to minor issues but it won't be too big if you can build your profile right.\n        â””â”€â”€ Are the place ments for AIML/DS branches done? \nOr are the first batch placements next year?\nWhat are the stats?\n            â””â”€â”€ The first AIML branch is still in 3rd sem lol\n                â””â”€â”€ ðŸ’€ðŸ’€"
