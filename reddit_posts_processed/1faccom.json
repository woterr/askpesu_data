So you should do all the questions given to you by your teacher.\n└── Are the questions in the slides enough atleast for isa?\n    └── I wouldn't suggest you to limit yourself to just a couple of questions per topic. Do at least 4 or 5.\n        ├── Alright thanks!\n        └── what do you mean by this?\n            └── It means that in order to get an A or an S, you might wanna practice more by solving a larger number of questions."
