If you get like hyd, blr, Allahabad or Delhi or even Lucknow....then it's better to go with IIIT....else he'll naw....and also since your thinking to join via JM then you definitely have to give your best to receive the CNR or MRD Scholarships, then it's definitely worth it....as they refund 40% and 50% of you tuition fees overall....for more go through the sub and figure it out....and don't give up so easily....prepare for advanced....you have less than 2 weeks now....ALL THE BEST TO YOU...."
