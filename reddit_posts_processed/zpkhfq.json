  "content": "In today's esa, when i was typing, i toggled some shortcut by mistake and a new tab opened.I assumed to have closed the window by mistake and I clicked on the assessment icon and proceeded to entire my login details, i was able to login and the answers which I had written were still there. I wrote the paper and submitted. Now, when i closed this window, there was the older window which I toggled out of by mistake it had no answers in it other than the few i had written before toggling and the timer was ticking, so i just closed the window and didn't submit it. I'm damn scared that I've messed up big time and my answers wouldn't have submitted.",

They can access which sites are being opened. Happened to a kid in my batch in first sem during ISAs, he had to leave the lab immediately."
