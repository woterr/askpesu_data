He studied prolly 1-2hrs per day max, but he studied *everyday*.\nConsistency is goated\nAlso he listened to class properly, but he had his fair share of fun as well. It's all honestly pretty simple if u start from day 1.\n└── Consistent hard work is underrated. You'll actually see that most of the toppers are people like your friend. The number of people who are inherent geniuses and can ace after studying 1-2 days only is marginal, probably a handful. \n\nIf you put in efforts from day 1, it becomes a lot simpler. 1-2 hours per day isn't much. Try it for a week and you'll see you'll already be updated with every class and the weekends are all to yourself."
