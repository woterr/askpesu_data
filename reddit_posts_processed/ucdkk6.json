Make sure you have a budget slide.\n\nTake it to your HOD as a proposal.\n├── Any idea what is the accepted budget range?\n│   └── Depends on the club and aimed activities\n│       └── Any idea what’s the ideal budget for tech clubs?\n│           ├── It's on a request basis\n\nSo you need to justify the money you are asking for\n│           └── If you're looking at software stuff, then your budget shouldn't be too high. You may be able to leverage a lot of existing infrastructure at the campus.\n\nIf you're looking at hardware like cars/drones/planes, you would need about 20L+ with the current inflationary trends.\n\nBut without more details on the technical club we can't really help you.\n└── Are first year students allowed to form clubs?\n    └── They can\n\nBut i suggest to wait for sometime\nUnderstand club culture\n\nAnd then form your own club"
