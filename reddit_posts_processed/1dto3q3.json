PLEASE LET GO OF YOUR CAPS LOCK.\n└── what if its just one mark away from slipping to the previous grade\n    └── Regardless, your grade will **never** decrease. They always assign the maximum grade obtained. So let us say you got a B grade and then after re-evaluation, they evaluated it and it came out to be a C. The final grade assigned to you will be a B. So you won't even get to know if your marks/grade decreased.\n        └── thank you so muchhh!"
