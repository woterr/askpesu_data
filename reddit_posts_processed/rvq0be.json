Simple as that.\n└── Bro you can study comp sci with math in the dual\nThat would be a killer combo ngl\n    └── OP asked about CS at PES vs Math MSc at BITS. If these colleges provide CS + Math dual majors, I'm not aware of it. \n\nSo what is the relevance them being a 'killer combo' here? I agree with you; I just don't understand how that helps OP.\n        └── Okay so dual degrees work this way - you do your msc course along with a btech degree for 5 years.\nHowever, your branch of engineering would be decided based on your cg in the first year.(8.5+ apprx)\n\nIf OP manages to get CS then the combo of math+cs would boost OPs skills and open a lot of doors.\n            └── I meant 8.5+ for CS"
