You can't take a U-turn in the service road with so much traffic, unless they use some small bus or that golf kart they have lol.\nYou can say I'm frustrated just as much , but it's better to just accept a 15 mins walk daily to and fro, gives mental peace."

      "body": "I doubt? Took the metro for the first and last time during my grad on Sunday and the metro bridge is just a short walk from the gate. Besides this, the driver would have to drive until Hosa Road to take a U-Turn and reach campus after dropping y'all. Back in 2021, Jawahar told us in our orientation that we would need to walk everywhere within campus and I doubt bro has changed his views four years later lmao. The golf kart dude has explicity been told not to transport students anywhere, I twisted my ankle once in my third year and I had to have an almost 10 minute talk with him that \"just because you can't see my injury doesn't mean it doesn't exist\" lmao. Maybe if a lot if you request, they might oblige but if they haven't provided a bus to the Konappana Agrahara bus stand, I don't see them providing a shuttle service to the metro, which is a shame because those roads are dangerous and the NICE Road exit is also there.\n\nRR Campus is a whole different story. Both Mysore Road and Pantarapalya Nayanadahalli metro stations are 2km away and its a common bus route.\nâ””â”€â”€ yea dude, its really hard sometimes to cross tht nice road ext"
