You should also refer to cutoffs with what's better.\nâ””â”€â”€ People say rvce and RVU will be having placements together,how about considering this\n    â””â”€â”€ They say that, but what they dont tell is, that they put a CGPA cutoff as of now. That is, only students above a certain cgpa (7-8) can sit with RVCE students. Below that, I cant vouch for.\n        â””â”€â”€ Ohk thanks, btw r u a pes senior\n            â””â”€â”€ Nope, rvce fresher\n                â””â”€â”€ Heyy, waiting for round 3\nHow is the EIE/ETE departments?\n                    â””â”€â”€ For RVCE, pretty decent I'd say-\nEIE min=4 max=30 median=10.5 avg=11.93\nETE min=5 max=22 median=8.5 avg=10.62"
