It changes every year and there is no way to predict when a certain company will visit PES for hiring.\n└── Oh okay, but in today's placement orientation, a very very blurry slide was displayed which had at least 15 company names on it and other things which most people could not see.\n    └── It could be feedback received from companies. Because companies only notify the placement cell 1-2 weeks in advance so there's no way to know."
