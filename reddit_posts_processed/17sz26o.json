Unless you like ete and want to do MS in that\n        └── Purely from a placement pov? Also how good is ete scope for ms/career after that ?\n            └── 100% CS in pes then ete has almost no placement. MS is only recommended if you really really like the subject and is harder than just getting placed"

If you dont get selected to any other colleges, then consider PES\n├── bro it depends on them, not everyone wants what is popular (ik pes is popular too but compared to iit, it isnt)\n│   └── Hmmm yeah, end of day its the OPs personal preference :)\n└── Lol my brother goes to RV(CSE) he says same shit about RV. Only thing better in RV is more quality Companies(slightly better) visit campus then pesu and competition is very less than PESU.\n\nIf you miss out on IITs and NITs I guess just join Local college whichever has best placements among the ones you are getting. End of the day its all."

And if you're thinking of joining ECE, don't join PES. Unless you're really passionate about ECE, you'll suffer a lot here. If your goal is to get placed, the placements are pretty trash this year, with only 5 people getting placed from my campus in ECE till now\n└── hasnt the placement situation been trash everywhere in general this year?\n    └── Yeah, but CSE people don't have it this bad tho\n        └── oh. i've heard the opposite"

      "body": "If you are joining for cse  or want to work in software company these are my advice\n\nMaintain high cgpa (more the better). Because competition is intense in pesu.\nStart solving DSA problems as early as possible preferably by 2nd year but earlier the better.\n\nPlay around with multiple tech stack and domains for the first or maybe 2nd year. From  the end of 2nd year onwards pickup one domain or two domain , two or three framework and gain expertise in that. \n\nHave good knowledge of Core subjects like OS,CN,DBMS not just whats required for exam but go beyond that.\n\nDon't run behind what is popular and what everyone is running behind like ML. Things like ML and AI might sound cool but there are hardly any jobs in that domain especially for Bachelors/fresher level. \nWhereas there are plenty in things like Web dev, Devops etc.\n\nChoose one domain and master it as best as you can\n\nAlso if you have plans abroad start working under teachers either on their projects or as TAs. This will help you immensely when it comes to LORs.\n\nAnd lastly have good fun participate in whatever activities you like whether you know it or not. And have fun\n└── Can u please tell wdym by 'TAs and LORs'\n    └── TAs mean teaching assistant.\n\nLORS mean Letter of recommendation. You need those if you plan on studying Masters abroad"
