      "body": "Hey, I worked on an IoT+Blockchain project under prof. Vadiraj. Haven't published the paper yet, but I am still working on the paper, and aim to publish it by next year. If you are wondering, which profs are good for blockchain, then I would suggest Shruti Jadon. And before working or thinking of any blockchain project ideas, first, take up the elective on blockchain or do the NPTEL course on blockchain to understand how blockchain works and then come up with ideas.\n└── Hey! Yes I'll be taking the elective. Is Prof Shruti from EC Campus? Can I send you dm lol?\n    └── No prof Shruti is from RR campus. Just ask your questions here might help others if they have same questions"
