Mkc pessat\n\nYou hv pes in comedk that's a huge advantage\n\nMsrit and bmsce cutoffs are gonna fall\n\nIf I'm not wrong under 5k rank(comedk) you'll get cse/cse spec In msrit/bmsce / pes ec\n\n\nLower fees aswell\n        â””â”€â”€ nah this year comedk was too tough. regret not writing 2nd board exam. dont make the blunder of thinking comedk is easier. if ur from state board and u study consistently u can get better rank in cet than comedk. trust me. well pessat was full on ace for me.\n            â””â”€â”€ hey bro have some doubts can i dm you"
