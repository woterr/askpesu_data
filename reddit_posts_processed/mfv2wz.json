      "body": "PES is your typical Indian Engineering (now Law) college. Engineering or not, rules of Engineering apply to all students. Add to that the tenacity of the management that puts money and fame over its students' health be it physical or mental, and so obsessed with winning \"the race\" that it sometimes forgets about the opinion of its so called \"stakeholders\", and you have yourself a mindless, heartless torture chamber. Believe me, no other college is any \"better\", but never for once think that PES could be your dream college. University toh naam ke liye hain. I don't care if I'm bad-mouth-ing the PESU under my own username, because they care equally less now that I've paid them for 4 years of absolute non-sense schooling. You'll find a couple great professors on campus, but then again, doesn't get any better than that, and they too are micro-managed so much so that they'll never be able to teach you well."
