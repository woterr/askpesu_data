  "content": " Hello all, hope you're having a great day !\n\nI'm applying for MSCS (non-thesis) programs in the US. I have already shortlisted universities below. I need your help in two things:   \n\n\n* Firstly, please let me know if the uni and their split is apt for my profile\n* Secondly, I would be very grateful if you could suggest additional schools OR suggest to drop some existing schools based on my profile\n\nMy profile :\n\n* BTech CSE '21 batch from PESU (Tier 3) with 9.03 GPA.\n* GRE : 163(Q) + 150 (V) = 313. (I know that my quant score is sub-par. But, I already gave GRE twice)\n* TOEFL : 106 (with 25+ in individual sections)\n* 1.5 YoE as SDE at a startup (2021 to 2022)\n* Working as RA at a systems lab at IISc (2022 to present)\n* Published a workshop paper in the area of SysML and 1 more paper is under review\n* Worked on a capstone project in the area of ML for systems in my 7th and 8th sem of undergrad\n* Have done multiple mini-projects in various courses during undergrad\n* 4 months of summer internship at HPE\n* SOP : Tailored it around the current challenges in SysML and how my research experience has motivated me to further delve into this domain. I intend to highlight the labs/faculties in this area with whom I would like to work.\n* LoR : This is my biggest concern. I would be able to get a maximum of 3 people to recommend me (for all the applications) and these 3 also wouldn't be very strong as I did average work in all my projects/research as I was not serious\n* End Goal after MS : To work as ML Systems Engineer / SDE / Related roles\n\nUniversity list :\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j3qu6uahfbhb1.png?width=382&format=png&auto=webp&s=45ed4d0eaad0780a8d7fd0db1c26211b8152d474",

At CMU the MCDS program is probably what you want to apply for and at Madison it's probably the PMP. At CMU GRE is recommended but you can choose to not submit. At Madison I believe it's not required. The PMP is a fairly affordable choice at a really good school, especially if you're not interested in pursuing a PhD down the road.\n└── I had PSU in my initial list. But, according to my research, a lot of posts in reddit said that it has very bad Profs and bad curriculum. Also, for some reason, it's not a popular choice for CS, with it's limited industry outcomes.  \nHence, I had to remove it from my list. But, if you have any info on the teaching/courses/industry outcomes of PSU. Request you to please let me know.   \nThanks.\n    └── Honestly the only reason I suggested it was because if I remember correctly they offer full waivers to TAs and RAs which can make it very affordable"
