  "content": "So my guide basically wants us to publish 2 papers, one survey paper regarding what we did in Phase 1 and another final paper. I am a total noob and I don't clearly understand how publications work. I am afraid that if we publish some stuff now, it will lead to self plagarism or some such problems later down the lane.   \nSo please suggest some resources to understand how publications work, and any resources on how to start writing a paper. Thanks a lot.",

      "body": "Publishing papers is really a good idea. Do not worry about plagiarism or the first survey paper even. Just focus on your project and generating results in a presentable way. Writing papers is just about building a good narrative. I'm sure your professor will help you with it."

      "body": "Don't publish twice. Instead, publish one single paper later. What you mention is right - publishing initial survey results first will just lead to a loss in novelty in the second paper. Having a single, robust and detailed paper is worth more than having 2 diluted ones. Self-plagiarism is a valid problem many run into while splitting their work into two papers.\n└── Thanks a lot, will try talking her out of the idea of two papers.\n    └── If you don’t mind me asking, who is your capstone guide? I sort of have a vague idea who it might be as one of my friends also had to go through the same thing….just wanted to confirm if it’s the same person."
