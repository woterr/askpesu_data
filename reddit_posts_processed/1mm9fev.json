  "content": "Till now, the grading system for Semesters 1 and 2 has been percentage-based (e.g., above 90% = S grade, above 80% = A grade, etc.). I wanted to know whether the same system will continue for the coming three years, or will it be changed to a percentile-based system?\n\nWill there be a diff in grading system of both branches ??\n\n",

So just bcoz aiml had relative grading for some subject doesn't mean cse guys also will, and vice versa."
