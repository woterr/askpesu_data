      "body": "Regardless of your interest in specializations, always put core CSE above all other specializations. There is nothing special about these specializations they merely exist to increase intake into CS. Especially here in PES, the syllabus between cs and aiml vaires only for the electives offered in 5th and 6th sem. Core CS always has access to electives related to AIML but AIML doesnt have access to all core CS electives. So be wise and put core CS above all."
