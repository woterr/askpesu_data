I keep hearing this name pop up everywhere but never what he said/does\n    └── Bro basically reads off of other people's slides, is absolutely unreasonable to talk to, yaps like no tomorrow and is consistently behind on syllabus even with extra classes. Oh yeah and will give homework only to never check it so there is no point or reward in people doing it.

He just narrates so much story about himself , you sometimes feel like Nolan sir would make the next Oppenheimer on him. During my initial days I used to trust his stories because I held pes in high standards. He used to body shame people he used to narrate stories of how he cheated with his wife 😭 \n\nJayashree ma'am, not the more famous one\n\nBad teaching , funny expression. Looking at her face and not laughing when she looks at you is the hardest thing you can do in PES. Atleast she lets you do what you want.\n\nChaitra parameshwarappa\n\nShe taught  linear algebra. Made me hate maths which is a very hard thing to do. She used to write random stuff on the board just to pass time. Never properly solve anything. Weirdly passionate about seating arrangements for class tests.
