  "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI've heard of students from other colleges participating in events at NITs and IITs, sometimes even representing their own college.\n\n* Does PESU have clubs or programs that facilitate participation in inter-college events (competitions, sports etc.) at other universities, especially NITs/IITs?\n* What's the general process for getting involved in these events?\n* Has anyone from PESU participated in events at other colleges and can share their experience?\n\nAny insights would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",
