Some commonly used scripting languages used in across (VLSI, Comm, DSP) industry are TCL, perl and python. Along with this, most of the tools work on Unix based OS- Linux. Therefore having knowledge of using CLI and shell (bash, csh) will be really helpful. \n\nApart from these the languages that u will learn in academic will be:  \n1. System(Verilog) for Design & Verification  \n2. Matlab  \n3. Python for ML.   \n4. Embedded C ( elective )"
