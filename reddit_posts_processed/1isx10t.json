I liked os as a subject so I read the tb but I can't get myself to be motivated enough to read everything from CN tb.\n        │   ├── the cn textbook is great and the topics are explained in a manner that makes it easy for a layman to understand. the only issue is the time constraint. \n\n i found cn to be much better than os (probably subjective because i really do not enjoy OS)\n        │   └── slides are enough for every subject in sem 4. read the textbook only if you have time. its really important that you understand the concepts well though.\n        └── did they ask any codes???\n            └── i think 1 question was coding. i don't remember what topic it was though."

Not entirely sure about the aiml part.\n└── they do. especially in isa 1. its nothing too much, iirc they asked us to identify and fix an error in the existing code with proper reasoning (something to do with processes, idr)\n    └── Ok thx"
