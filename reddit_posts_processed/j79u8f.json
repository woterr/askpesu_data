  "content": "I have recently joined PESU and I will be a first year student (soon enough hopefully), but i couldn't get the branch i wanted. I wanted CS but ended up with ECE. I wanted to know the exact placement procedure. How is the placement process conducted? How do they decide which branch gets to sit for a certain company? Does every branch get to sit for all the companies? If not, then how is the process different for let's say, ECE and CS departments?",
