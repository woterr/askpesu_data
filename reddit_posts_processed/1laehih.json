Many would actually sign up for this to improve their scores.\nâ””â”€â”€ What can be done about this so that PES starts holding improvement exams?\n    â””â”€â”€ I don't know their reason behind *not* having it, so I don't know what could be said to counter it. Besides, I don't think you're going to see any changes soon because this has been a long standing point for years. You're welcome to try discussing this over with the COE and finding out the reason they don't provision it."
