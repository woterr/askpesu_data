      "body": "Yes, you can attend the counselling even if you missed the first round. I'm not sure how it is this time, but for my batch, we had to pay the entire fees  and submit our documents while confirming our seat in the second round. They usually send a mail which tells you how this all works and what the deadline is. If you get an IIT, they say they'll refund most of your fees. I don't know if it's true or not. But if you get a seat through cet in pes, then they'll adjust your fees according to the cet fees\n└── Ahh thanks alot for the info, the thing is i was looking forward to my Bitsat result too, but the counselling takes place way too late and it isnt viable for me to lose 4.5L here, so was wondering if Bits had this special policy along with iits and nits"
