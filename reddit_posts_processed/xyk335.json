      "body": "Not worth it. An mtech from tier 3 college like PES is just a degree. Since you have already passed your BE I suggest you apply for service based company and practice leetcode\n└── I got into a service based company and have an year of exp. The workplace was just waste of time with no learning. Rotational shifs/offs. Health was taking a toll. I wanted some time to upskill. I thought of taking a degree meanwhile.\n    └── Just practice leetcode and start giving interviews. You already know how the learning is in private colleges and the chances of getting into a product based company is very low.\nYou will end up wasting most of the time writing assignments, studying for ISA and attending classes.\nMy suggestion would be to study for Gate and apply for IIITB. Even if you don't get IIITB you will learn computer science concepts"
