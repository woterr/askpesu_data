So 40 and 50 percent  of 1.8\n\nMrd is 72k and cnr is 90k.\n├── Yes, I’m in 2nd year too, fee is the same\nI think it’s the other way round this time, so cnr is 72k and mrd 90k afaik!\n│   ├── Oh yeah i remember. I guess they decided mrd is more important. Doesn't matter though money doesn't change\n│   │   └── Is it wrong to confirm lol\n│   └── Wait, so mrd is supposed to be 90k?? When did this change take place?\n└── Not anymore. They changed it to total fee afaik. Atleast that is what they send in the seminar at the start of the sem. So cnr is 80k and mrd is 1.025L\n    └── I hope it's true\n\nCan you send the pdf you found it in. I want the happiness\n        └── It wasnt a pdf. It was said during the seminar at the start of the sem."
