You'll be good enough\n└── I'm talking about courses apart from college related to computer science and coding\n    └── If u want theres this course called “the odin project” and its for webdev but its really, REALLY well made, could help u in hackathons if u need to develop a ui for a project\n        └── How long does it take on an avg. to complete it?\n            └── Maybe 3 months, but you can steam roll through it in less than 2, for each lesson they make u read the same concept twice or thrice from different articles  so that you can easily understand/register it and projects can either be fancy and well thought out or u can quickly make one following the guidelines\n\n+++no certificate, but opportunity to make several quality projects/ good foundation"
