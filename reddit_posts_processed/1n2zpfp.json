  "content": "Samsung has come for summer internship for 3rd year peeps . They shortlisted people who have gpa between 7.5-8.5 and no one above 8.5.\nIt might have been resume based but I dont think the gpas would be soo strictly in this range.\nSo grinding for gpa doesn't make sense now. \nI wanted to ask seniors does lot of companies do this ?",

They might be doing resume based shortlisting \n4. You might have missed to attend any event hosted by them or in some cases the company sends the link multiple times and you have to apply."

      "body": "Then it's a bit of random shortlisting. Not in your hands. Not all companies do it. Some companies do it and that's when it sucks. Otherwise, mostly the shortlisting happens starting from a higher GPA range, say 9+, then 8.5-9 and so on. If companies are hiring you for a non SDE role, say an AIML, Data Science or Web dev role they would do resume based shortlisting. \n\nAnd bruh, try to keep your GPA in the 8.5-9 range if possible. It definitely does help a lot in the long run. If you are a girl, then even more helpful."
