      "body": "Second years usually dont get internship mails, it usually starts from third year. You gotta find internships urself after 4th sem in most cases, cause companies arent ready to take you in yet.\n└── No i don't mean at actual companies. I meant those ones which clubs like isfcr have. It's the only one for which i got a mail. But i hear talk about there being more\n    ├── PES Innovation labs recently concluded their test, di you get mail for that ? Also keep your eyes on pesuacademy and Instagram handles as well. You will get some updates from there. So far , PIL, PVL , ISFCR and Bioinnovation lab (i think that is only for biotech students) have published internship applications.\n    ├── All research clubs take in interns during the summer. If you've missed out, you can always reach out to any prof and ask to work with them.\n    └── Pro tip: Just go to these centers and talk to the profs. 99% of the times they'll just assign you a project. ISFCR is pretty great but don't expect the profs to help you in anyway. You can try off campus too."
