SO WRITE PESSAT don't underestimate PES.\n└── Thanks a bunch! Your kindness is so bright, it could outshine a supernova. You're officially my favorite star in orbit!"

      "body": "My two cents as a first year:\nIf you're really passionate about the course (or placements for that matter), then this isn't too bad a place. The first year is a breeze so far but from what I've heard it gets harder, so I can't say.\nThey're pretty thorough with the coursework but they're also a bit academically strict, so pick your poison. BUT coming to the second part of your question, the crowd is fantastic, there's all kinds of folks and you'll definitely find your people.\n└── Thanks for the reality check!"

      "body": "It’s easy to get a high rank, but the fees are high. And when the fees are high, you have many options anyways. If you think it’s better than other private colleges then go for it. I personally picked vit over pes but I think vit is probably way stricter.\n└── Thanks for the insight! High fees, high ranks, and tough choices – feels like I'm navigating a maze. Appreciate the advice!"
