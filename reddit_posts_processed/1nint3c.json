      "body": "You can enter college through the side gate, which is a little bit ahead of the main gate but you will not be allowed to go to the two wheeler parking near the main gate, you will have to go to the back gate and park near the cricket field. There's never any parking especially if you're late but if you search a little you can find some parking."
