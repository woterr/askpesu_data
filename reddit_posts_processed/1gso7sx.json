Also take regular and timely breaks from studying, and make sure when you're on a break from your laptop, you aren't on your phone. (A challenge for your generation, but I know). Taking a break from one screen to be on another screen doesn't solve the problem.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ it feels like your spying on us. also, when are you going to evolve ?\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ No reason to evolve when all the incoming PESts are mentally devolving backwards\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ Wait till you get added to the most brainrot chat groups of the incoming pests. There is no escaping that\nâ””â”€â”€ U are the same gen as us ðŸ˜­"

Just use dark mode on low brightness, that's what I do.\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ That would strain eyes in other ways\nâ”œâ”€â”€ It doesnâ€™t\nâ”œâ”€â”€ none of those \"screen glasses\" help.\nâ””â”€â”€ Hey, currently using those. It helps to a certain extent but it doesn't protect your eyes from strain etc. it does help in reducing the harshness of light and it helps with sunlight glare in classrooms."
