  "content": "Dear male humans of PES, \n I've seen a couple of posts about this, so this is a public service announcement for those of you who still think talking to a girl requires a PhD in psychology or divine intervention\n\n1. Be hygienic and dress properly.\nThis is an obvious one, but a lot of guys seem to fail at it. Clean clothes, combed hair, and maybe a shower. Appearance matters to everyone regardless of gender.\n\n\n2. Don’t approach when she’s busy.\nIf she’s on her phone, with friends, or looks like she’s in a rush, don’t barge in. Wait for a better moment.\nIf she’s talking to someone else or wearing earphones, don’t bother.\n\n\n3. Talk about something relevant.\nIf you're in the same class, talk about class. If you’re both in the same place, mention something related to that. Keep it natural.\nSome topics could be:\n\nUpcoming exams or assignments (if you’re in the same class)\n\nEvents happening around campus\n\nMutual friends or acquaintances\n\nSomething interesting you both might have seen recently (like a movie or a TV show)\n\n\n\n4. Don’t text endlessly.\nIf she’s not replying, stop texting. Don’t flood her chats like some desperate idiot. If she wants to talk, she’ll respond.\n\n\n5. Observe body language.\nIf she’s avoiding eye contact, leaning away, or looking uncomfortable, don’t be a dumbass and keep pushing.\n\n\n6. Don’t get too close too soon.\nStart with simple conversation. No “you’re so cute” or “you’re like a sister” stuff. Don’t dive into deep, weird topics right away.\n\n\n7. If she’s not interested, don’t keep going.\nIf she’s giving you one-word answers or avoiding you, take the hint, and stop being a pest.\n\n\n8. Be NORMAL.\nNo “rizz” bullshit or trying to act like you’re cooler than you actually are.\n\n\n9. Give genuine compliments that are not always about looks\nCompliment her on her character or talents. Tell her, “You sing really well,” or \"I admire your creativity with that project\" Avoid bullshit like “You’re so hot bb.” Compliments that reflect her qualities matter a lot more.\n\n\n10. Know when to wrap it up.\nIf the conversation’s dying, don’t drag it out. Just walk away like a normal person.\n\n\n11. Don’t use cringe ass WhatsApp pickup lines.\nThey never work. Just talk to her like a damn human being\n\n\n12. Don’t be afraid to be awkward.\nTrust me a lot of girls feel awkward around guys too so don’t sweat it. Just own it and keep going.\n\nThe same applies for girls",
