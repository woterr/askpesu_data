Was wondering if they'll start the classes of others or not who got alloted in 1st round ?\n├── Will classes be starting atleast this month?\n├── but it doesn't make sense..... there's no relation between pessat and kcet counselling\n│   ├── Students can convert pessat seats into kcet seats\n│   └── PESSAT 2nd Round and KCET 1st round students start classes together (For our batch it happened 2 months after PESSAT 1st round students started classes)\n└── When will KCET counselling gonna start then??"
