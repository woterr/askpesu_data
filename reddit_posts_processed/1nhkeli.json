  "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m trying to pay the remaining balance of my college fees, and something seems off. My total fees were ₹118,000, and I’ve already paid in two installments of ₹50,000 each. Now, when I try to pay the remaining ₹18,000, the system is showing that the minimum payment should be ₹25,000.\n\nHas anyone else faced this issue? How did you resolve it?",
