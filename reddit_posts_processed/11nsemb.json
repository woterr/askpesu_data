Some of my friends have had insane correction mistakes, one had multiple pages being missed in the correction and their grade improved from C to A. While for most others there were minor mistakes so grade didn't change at all, or only by one. So yes it's definitely possible, in most semesters I knew atleast one person who had correction related errors, but again they're uncommon to be on such a scale that they change your grade entirely.\n\nRegardless, if you're confident about your performance in the ESA and feel like you should have obtained more, *do review*. You won't get this opportunity again (you cannot review past semester papers and increase grade in a later semester). It might cost a bit, but if your grade *does* improve, especially for a course worth 4 credits, it can significantly improve your SGPA and in turn, your CGPA."
