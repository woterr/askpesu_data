How long do most people do the internship for in the 8th sem?\n    └── Most people who get fte+internship will have to do it for 6 months during the 8th sem even if you have done the summer internship (as most companies want you to work for 6 month with them).\nThe normal is you can earn internship credit in 2 ways, 2+6 or 0+8.\n        └── Tysm man"

They usually have a very small registration window (<1 day sometimes)\n\nPeople usually aren't very serious about DSA, system design, etc during this time so the competition is lesser."
