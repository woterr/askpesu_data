      "body": "There's no branch in PESU called Cybersecurity(or CSE with a specialization in Cybersecurity).\nThe only CS branches they offer are CSE core and CS with Specialization in AIML.\nThey do offer electives related to Cybersecurity though. Picking these Cybersecurity related electives will give u a Cybersecurity specialization certificate after your 4th Year when you graduate. This specialization certificate does not have much value and won't give you much of an advantage( from what I have heard from our seniors)\nThere is also a research lab(ISFCR) in our college which deals with Cybersecurity\n├── I think he means as an elective he's a graduate\n└── Thanks alot man! You answer my question."
