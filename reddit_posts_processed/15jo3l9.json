So about 15 tests/exams per semester.\n└── Is it easier than before?\n    └── Nope, harder. The test content per ISA has increased, and from whatever we've heard, it won't be all MCQs anymore. Plus the 5 ISA system had a \"best 4\" policy where the 4 best scores would be taken, but now that's not there anymore so you need to do well in all ISAs."
