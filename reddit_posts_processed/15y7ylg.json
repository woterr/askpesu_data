But can I know why it was discontinued ?\n    ├── No demand/teachers unavailable\n    └── Simply demand vs supply case : \nNo placements in mech => no seat takers =>loss for college => branch discontinued\n\nIt got shifted to rr campus . The only mechanical teachers in ec campus left are those who teach first year engineering students mechanics and mechanical subjects ."
