So yeah I doubt people would risk it.\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ The demographic of the round 2 candidates changes. You'll find people who didn't get anything anywhere else or people looking to upgrade their seats.\nâ”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ Let's see how it goes.\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ so a rank of 740 would definitely get cse in the 2nd round right?\nâ”‚           â””â”€â”€ Yes\nâ”‚               â””â”€â”€ i see :) thank you for taking the time to respond dude\nâ”‚                   â””â”€â”€ No issues :)\nâ””â”€â”€ I have 75xx rank. Any seat I can get tomorrow ? Please help."
