Remaining 50M is scaled down from ESA which decides your grade\n└── Umm but we were told assignments were for 10 m is that wrong?\n    └── That is correct, depending on number of assignments each will be scaled to around 7 marks and including your project it will be evaluated to 20M which will be added along with scaled down ISA marks to give your final ISA\n        └── Thankyou!"
