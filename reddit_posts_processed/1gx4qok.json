I screwed up badd....bt i really  really hope she doesn't take off my exam. My reputation,  everything is ruined....for a dumb mistake.  I wont get into any good clg for masters....my life is over and everything with it. I dont wanna live\n    ├── Bruh\nThat ok! Chill !!!!\nNtg is gonna happen \nEverything will be alright!\n\nJust face it, dont just give up already!!\n    ├── Hey brother. Relax. We are all humans and bound to make mistakes.  About the reputation, to be honest, each has their own problems. No one really cares about anyone's reputation. Nothing is lost. it's just a matter of writing an apology letter, talking to the dean and apologizing. That's it. Everything will be just fine. Making mistakes and learning from it is what makes one mature. We are all learning. We are all growing. Relax. Inhale and exhale deeply. This too shall pass.\n    └── Nothing like that bruh don't worry. It is never that deep and you'll manage. Noone will even remember in a week or two so don't worry about reputation or anything like that. Whatever comes your way, make sure you try your hardest and you'll be ok. Your life is far from over, it's barely even started! Take care my friend"
