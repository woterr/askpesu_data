  "content": "Would Anyone Please tell me the cutoff of ECE in PESU EC campus in round 1 of pessat counselling 2023? It would be better if I could also get the number of seats remaining at the end of the counselling. I was thinking of joining the second round counselling but I have a pessat rank of 8.2k. Please also tell me if I can get ECE in EC campus in round 2 counselling.",
