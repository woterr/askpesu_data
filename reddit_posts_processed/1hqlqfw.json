As I said - there is a very valid reason most of your seniors do not like most of your batch. The dislike may be exaggerated, but it is not misplaced at all.

If you all don't need my help, I'll just stop helping out here.\n│       └── l'm not from this \"batch\", i just find your egoistic and cocky reply very harsh on these freshers\n│           └── So much that you created an account today just to post this eh? Lovely.\n\nAnyway, you did not address any of my actual points and are just picking at a factual assumption I made. People like you always love to point fingers and ask questions but have no response when you actually get valid responses. \n\nAnd its a massive shame that this entire post has turned more into picking apart my comments about freshers acting retarded instead of actually calling out the freshers doing something retarded. Speaks a lot about your maturity and priorities.\n│               └── since there are people from every batch here, none of them objected to it as well, are you trying to call every batch retarded now? maybe the entire college is retarded and the only sane dignified and mature person here is you.\nyou are just a pretentious brat.\nand as for the freshers throwing the bed off; it aint that deep 😭\n│                   └── Definitely the most mature person on this comment thread given that nobody else seems to object to what was done. Don't see how I'm pretentious given that a lot about my life is transparent, I never mince my words and you can always look up the person I am and judge for yourself. I've never pretended to be someone I'm not, my words and opinions are always my own and I always accept it when my facts/suggestions/advice is wrong. \n\nAnd I'm sorry but you cannot possibly justify vandalism and say \"it ain't that deep\". You are simply encouraging worse, if not similar behaviour. You cannot damage property that doesn't belong to you and say \"lols bro\". Howd you find it if someone entered your room and threw your bed out?\n\nAs I said previously, these are students still dependent on their parents' money for hostel amenities. Atleast respect the money your parents are putting in for your education. Once you start earning on your own, I'd love to see how many of you would find it \"not deep\" to throw the stuff you've bought with your earnings out from your balcony. There is nothing funny about breaking private property. \n\nIf you're their senior as you claim to be , maybe try setting a better example by\n│                       └── i can't believe you find throwing a bed off so serious, you wouldn't have survived college if you were born a decade ago, the things I've heard from my parents and his colleagues;nah America has turned you soft and yes I'm setting an example by helping them realise they can't be bullied into not having fun as kids by some wannabe whitewashed egoistic senior\n│                           └── Here, addressed the same point earlier about previous generations: https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/s/xf8H5aXFvo\n\nI'm sorry but I was raised better than to throw things my parents paid for out from the balcony or vandalise something else in the name of fun. I am not sure how you or the others can normalise something as serious as damaging private property.\n\n> you find throwing a bed off so serious\n\nYes, I find it serious because I understood the financial privilege I came from and I'm aware that there are millions in our country who don't have what you and I do. My parents sacrificed a lot to support my dreams, and I'm grateful for everything they've provided. So destroying property has never been \"fun\" for me. The very thought of that would be disrespectful to everything they've done for me. \n\nIf you see nothing wrong in it, you are simply too young and immature to realise the privilege you come from and the value of money. Wait until you start earning and you will then realise how it feels to destroy your own property. Or even worse, when you work your ass off to buy someone something they need and they break it for \"fun\". \n\n> bullied into not having fun\n\nI never said people aren't allowed to have fun. By all means, these are your years to enjoy and we've been in your shoes too. But there's a fine line between having fun and being a nuisance. Breaking property isn't the only way to have fun. \n\nAnd as I said, if you all don't want my help anymore on this sub, happy to oblige. It was all out of goodwill for juniors. If all you guys are gonna do is weird/inappropriate stuff which we seniors have to put up with and yet expect us to help you out, or assassinate my character because you think I shouldn't have called you put on something like this, then sure. You aren't really going to get any support or help from me or most of the other seniors.\n│                               └── True🙏🙏\n└── Bruh, you’re just typing out long paragraphs trying to justify yourself like you’re in some kind of court trial. The thing is, it’s your opinion. If you didn’t like it, you could’ve just said, ‘This is lame’ or ‘This is wrong’ or something like that. But calling the entire batch of freshers ‘fucked in the head’ based on the actions of a few students just shows how presumptuous you are about them. Most people here aren’t enjoying or applauding them for their actions, it’s just funny how stupid they are. They’ll surely get punished by the management. They’re still freshers and don’t have a clear idea of the consequences, and they’ll be the ones to suffer.\n\nWhy do you care so much, acting like some kind of vigilante? Putting out your opinion isn’t wrong, but generalizing this to the entire batch just makes it seem like you think you’re the only mature person who rises against bad behaviour.\n    └── 1. It's appalling how not a single comment did what you asked, neither before my original comment nor after. Clearly, nobody pointed out how this was wrong. That is why I care. These are kids who obviously do not know what they are doing. As a senior if you or I don't attend the very least try to show them the right path, we wouldn't be good seniors. \n2. Presumptuous? Absolutely. There are many reasons that justify so. Maybe one day (and if possible), I'll show you the cleanup we need to do of all the inappropriate and mindless content posted by this batch in various posts, comments and messages across different platforms. You don't get to see it because we try our best to clean them up before it gets activity. From weird NSFW content to declarations of violence, there is something of everything. So yes, there *is* is a prevailing negative opinion about this batch. As I said in a different comment: the dislike is a little exaggerated but it's definitely not misplaced. We don't hate everyone obviously, but it's hard to like everyone. \n3. Long paragraphs are justified, given that most of these comments went after my character and even called me out as a racist (?). If you think me calling them retards was the last straw, then I should have called it and turned my back on this batch months ago when the freshers started calling me all sorts of things. But I didn't, I continued out of goodwill and I guess that's the price I paid for being nice\n        └── I’ve seen some of the recent posts, and honestly, some of them are just plain redundant and stupid. Seeing how people replied to your comment—especially throwing around words like ‘racist’—felt completely unnecessary. I can imagine how frustrating it must be for you as a mod to deal with stuff like this. But let’s be real, no matter what you say, they’re just going to gang up on you anyway, so it’s not worth stressing over. You can’t change them—let the management deal with it. I’m pretty sure they’re already aware of what’s going on.\n\nThat said, this subreddit is actually a great place. I’ve resolved quite a few issues here myself, even back when I was a fresher. Keeping it running smoothly is important, and as a mod, you’ve got the power to make that happen. Honestly, I have no idea how you even find the time or patience for this. I can’t imagine managing something like this after I graduate.\n\nAt the end of the day, all you can do is keep maintaining the subreddit and doing your part. You’re not going to change everyone, especially when they’re not willing to listen. \nAnyways Happy New Year, and thanks for everything you’ve done here. A lot of students, including me, have benefited from your efforts.\n            └── Yep, you're right. \n\nAnd no problem, always happy to help fellow juniors. Happy New Year to you as well!"
