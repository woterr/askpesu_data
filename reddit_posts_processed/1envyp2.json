The security does not say anything if you wear the temporary id.  \nWhen entering libraries, sometimes they may ask to scan it, just tell them it's temporary, and you'll get the proper one when you start your session next month.   \nFor wifi, I just took the credentials of a senior who I know, you can do this too.  \n  \nOr try:  \nUsername - graviton01\n\nPassword - graviton01\n\ngraviton02 and graviton03 should work too  \n  \nA senior said they were given these credentials in an old hackathon, and they still work. Haven't tried them myself, though.\n├── Ahh cool thnx alot, this was helpful .... \n│   └── np, btw, if you just want to sit, avoid the libraries which have books, they will be stricter there. Security in the non-book lending libraries is pretty chill. You can try the 13th floor BE block one for example.\n│       └── Okk\n└── what is the difference between srn and prn?

When I checked my profile on pesu academy, it showed SRN- NA\n    └── I think they use prn as temporary student identity during counselling time, probably cause a lot of people would give up their seat or pick a different college. As far as I know, once you actually join, you'll be using your srn only everywhere.\n\nSo yeah, the one on your temporary id is prn, and you'll get your srn later."
