  "content": "I've joined mechanical engineering in pes rr campus and classes start on 25th August, I live near JP nagar 8th phase and wanted to know how to commute ( don't prefer college bus as timings will be restricted... uk for using facilities/library... or am i overthinking?) do i need to get a 2 wheeler? BMTC takes little long and is unreliable. \n\nI also wanted to know the timings of college and classes in general. And last thing do I NEED a laptop or any other items? \n\nIt'll be of great help as my dad is also asking 🙏🙏",

Timings are 8 for odd semester and 8:45 for even semesters\n├── Can I DM you?\n│   ├── sure\n│   └── Sure\n└── I don't think ill be getting two wheeler until December or Jan, so until then do I ride with bmtc? then ill have to leave house at like 6:15 or 6:30 and will busses be there at that time?\n    ├── Check the moovit app for bus timings as well as route near your home, but mostly it should be, many people come via bmtc.\n    └── Check google maps for timings. There's an arrive by time option. \n\nAlso try out tummoc app for bus passes. Momthly passes come for around 2k (cheaper than 2 way travel for some cases)"
