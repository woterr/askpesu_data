Did you have to collect from the reception (assuming you were in class when it was delivered)?\n    └── Wasn't that brave. I excused myself from class and collected it myself. Their delivery to office has a pre selected time ig. I put it around classes where they'd let me out if I asked.\n        └── Right cool, thanks mate!"
