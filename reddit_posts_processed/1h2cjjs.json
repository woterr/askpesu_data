I understand the need for a cgpa requirement but the teaching at pes is subpar and trash , most courses suck ass and the only way you can get a good grade is by glucking down the slides. Sometimes even the slides and notes are fucking trash and incomplete.\nAtleast VIT has a proper resource system\nâ”œâ”€â”€ but the syllabus of pes is betetr right and not outdated? Just asking\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ It's up to date but out of order.\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ The syllabus is better, but the execution is really bad. It used to be 5 units , now it's 4 and it's all messed up and most profs are crap.\n\nBasically, the effort is you and you only , which you can literally do in any other college. There are some good opportunities that pes gives ofc , but the management seems to fucking all of that over in favour of making more money \n\nThis place massively fell off man , anti club rules , shitty HODs and whatnot\nâ””â”€â”€ i completely agree. im paying you 4 lakh a year for a degree, the least you could do is employ decent teachers. \n\nthe only redeeming quality of this college are it's reasonably good CSE placements; remove that, and the college is nothing but an awful shithole.\n    â””â”€â”€ Exactly. I don't know what'll happen to this place in ten years , it's surely leaning towards becoming VIT instead of IIT.\n\nAtleast VIT knows it's worth."
