      "body": "Unpredictable , last year cutoff is your best reference but even that is never 100% accurate.\n└── Unfortunately, 2022 was a year of anomaly. In 2022, the kcet counseling happened way after jee counseling due to which the cutoffs dropped way more than expected. For example in 2021, CSE at EC campus closed around 2700 but in 2022 it went all the way up to 5k ig. Refer 2021 and 2020 cut offs for best understanding\n    ├── bro that way even 2021 wasnt only KCET marks considered?\n    │   └── Bro that only affected peoples' ranks afaik. The cutoff should still be relevant\n    │       └── even 2021 counselling was in august right?\n    │           └── Nope it was in Dec\n    │               └── That's even more delayed than 2022\n    └── Lol same thing is happening this year with pessat manipal and IIIT-H cutoffs\n        └── Do you have info on PESSAT cut-offs for 2023 round 1?"
