Any institution/organisation follows regional holidays. Once you start working, you will also see that different campuses of a company in different parts of the country will have a slightly different set of holidays.\n    â””â”€â”€ Yeah but it's hard for people to fathom that a festival like Holi isn't celebrated much in south while it is one of the major festivals in north India.\n        â””â”€â”€ I completely understand. I'm not a South Indian either and I've never gotten to celebrate Holi properly since I grew up in Bangalore.\n            â”œâ”€â”€ Happy cake day!\n            â””â”€â”€ Sad to hear that mate"
