They'll probably announce their recruitments sometime during the semester, be on the lookout for announcements from them on the WhatsApp groups or the discord server (and posters around campus!) If you don't find either chances are their recruitments have been completed already, maybe try in the upcoming sems.  \nIf you personally know any of the club heads that helps a lot too lol  \n>!(btw, I'm a fresher, so I'm just answering based on what I know so far, if I've said something wrong pls correct me)!<"
