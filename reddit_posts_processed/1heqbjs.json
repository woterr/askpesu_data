  "content": "Hey there. Just looking for a friend who can tech with me and would be willing to hangout/study together/work on websites/apps and just be willing to be there. It has been kinda tough to find decent friends around here. I love reading fiction, non-fiction, science and books on social issues. And I also love watching physics documentaries otherwise. Honestly just need a girl to chill with in the amaatra girls hostel and college. Dm if you’re interested ",

You seem to have a rather unfairly strong but negative opinion of academically oriented people. \n\nYou should know that everyone you meet across different walks of life has different priorities - to some, it's to have fun and take life one step at a time, but to some it's to academically excel in the career they are going to build by getting a head start with a good GPA. If you don't like them, that's okay, you're not obligated to click with everyone. But it does not give you any right to comment negatively about how they live their life.\n\nIt's okay to be different and have different priorities in life, maybe understand that before passing derogatory and vile comments on your own batchmates. Maybe reflect a little on the person you are or present yourself to be, and you may realise why you're struggling to make friends."
