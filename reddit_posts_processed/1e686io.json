Minus the ~10k counseling fee.\n\nHostel fee is exactly what you paid, minus the 30k caution deposit which will be returned whenever you leave the hostel. I think they also keep like 3k per year from that as well\n└── And this yearly right? Both hostel and college fees\n    └── Yup\n        └── Okay thanks"
