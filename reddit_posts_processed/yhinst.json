      "body": "I'm sure you already know about the similarities when it comes to placements and having the same degree and as you said fests and clubs don't matter to you. \n\nOne of the other factors is travel and commute and that depends on you. The other thing you probably want to look into are the research clubs and internship opportunities at these clubs.\n\nBack when I was still in college, RR campus research clubs like CDSAML and CCBD did not recruit people from EC campus. I am not sure if things have changed (I heard they have but might want to confirm). These clubs offered good internships to students in 1st and 2nd year. Also back then EC campus didn't really have any prominent research clubs but I'm not too sure of the scene now. \n\nMaybe ask around about this and take a decision based on what you're looking for. If that is not an issue for you as well, then EC campus is by far the way to go."
