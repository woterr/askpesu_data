I was never interested in that subject in the first place and the questions they asked were vague and open to interpretation. If you have a lot of prior experience with web dev, it shouldn't be a problem though\n        â””â”€â”€ Thanks for inputs . How was afll ddco from your pov\n            â””â”€â”€ Afll was easy and ddco was moderate for me. I was not able to answer any question from the second unit in ddco esa. I got everything else though."
