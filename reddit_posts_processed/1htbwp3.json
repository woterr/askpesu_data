      "body": "Who cares, the subjects taught at pes contain very little to no actual thinking involved. Literally all things are just mugging up facts and \"numericals\" are basically just remembering procedures. \n\nThought it gets better, but there's nothing at all. There is not a single subject in which you cannot score full marks if you have the slides open. \n\nSo what's the point of having these teachers anyways?\n├── FACTOS!!!\n└── In my personal experience, a good teacher can make a difference, provided the student actually listens in class. For subjects where I had excellent teachers (only few), I barely glanced at the slides before exams and still walked away with an  S. For everything else, I had to slog through slides, which isn't exactly an issue given that as a student it's literally what I'm supposed to do, but it's less about laziness and more about the unnecessary inconvenience of compensating for their failure to teach.\n    └── so your point is that some teachers are more entertaining/interesting which makes you listen to their class?\n\nokay i suppose that's a valid way to look at it. and i guess it can save a lot of time.\n\nbut my point is that the subjects themselves lack any sort of complexity. it's a million times worse than 11/12th where you have to actually spend time thinking about a problem. it's like 10th where you either write theory, or solve a \"numerical\" by following a given procedure. \n\nand these are the subjects with \"numericals\". the theory subjects just make me want to blow my brains out\n\nin your explanation, the teachers only help in making it a more enjoyable process to remember the contents of the slides.\n        ├── >so your point is that some teachers are more entertaining/interesting which makes you listen to their class?\n\n\nyes. Anyone would listen to a teacher who actually knows how to teach and make learning \"fun\". most teachers here do nothing but read off slides like mindless robots, draining any interest or enthusiasm from the subject. \n\n>in your explanation, the teachers only help in making it a more enjoyable process to remember the contents of the slides. shouldn't a teacher do more than that\n\nI didn’t say it was only that😭. It's about having both the knowledge and the skill to teach and engage your students, as well as a willingness to answer doubts. Maybe you can consider other factors as well, but these are the ones I use to determine whether I would deem a teacher to be good or not. I don't know what else I should expect from one.\n\n\nWhen it comes to the complexity of courses, I’d say it’s subjective. But yeah i generally agree it’s a better than shithole cram schools in 11th 12th.\n        │   └── I ain't from PESU. But I am in similar tier engineering college and damn every word u have written is so true.\n        └── > the theory subjects just make me want to blow my brains out \n\nIs there any subject in the current CS curriculum which is 100% theory and has absolutely zero programming or numerical components?"
