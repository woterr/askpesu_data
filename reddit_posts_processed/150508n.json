  "content": "I usually try my best to reply to everyone's questions to help them out. Someone close to me needs some help with a user study for their research, so hopefully I can get back some help in return today :))\n\nTheir team is looking to **evaluate a novel language model aimed at generating controlled Math Word Problems with a high degree of mathematical validity**.  Their work is currently state-of-the-art and is is showing significant promise. Your responses will greatly assist them in evaluating their work and improving the results of their study. \n\nNote that you will *not be required to solve any problem*, and simply qualitatively evaluate the problem. **The survey is short, and will not take up more than 3 minutes** of your time to fill out.\n\nThanks!",
