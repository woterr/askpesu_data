I wanted to ask if the girls’ hostels in PES RR campus are already full or if admissions are still open. Any seniors or current students, please share your experience or guidance.\n\nThanks in advance!\n    └── Comment unrelated to the post."

And what are the infra problems?\n│       └── mostly its the wifi issue and they not being able to accomodate\n│           └── Wifi issues don't seem so big but anyways they should try to eliminate these kind of things.... Were these also there for your batch i.e 25 batch?\n│               └── It's the biggest issue in campus, holding a test for 1k+ people in the campus is very difficult with the quality of wifi we have.\n│                   ├── Ohh then it's a major issue\n│                   └── Seems like a pretty solvable issue.\nInfra should not be a limiting factor\n│                       └── All classes are happening along with the test, so the wifi has difficulty.\n├── It's not completely true; Few backed out because of date unavailability(they wanted a particular date), but most of the companies which have shown interest are visiting.\n│   └── Ohh\n└── yup, some high paying ones also backed out. This was the most disappointing thing. While a stream of tier2 and 3 companies were coming, these backed out. luckily, some of them, who backed out of the internship process, came back for FTE hiring.\n    └── Oh good to hear that but they should do something atleast give tier 1 companies more priority\n        └── The PO doesn't care man. If you ask him, he might ask you to prefer a tier3 company over a tier1 company lol"

The guys had a 9.5+ cutoff iirc, while it was 9+ for girls which is a lot more achievable. you can expect the ratio to be 1:2 to 1:4"

      "body": "No but I have heard that companies would also not mind shifting dates if the PESU placements give them an alternate date before and plan it out properly for OA and interviews. Poor management of dates by placements office is also a major drawback here\n└── Most companies already have planned out recruitment in advance, which includes dates for OAs and interviews for different colleges. The date selection is on the company's end and then proposed to PES, and given their plans, they might not have room to adjust. Quite naturally, the larger the company, the lesser the chance they will reschedule."

I've confirmed that others, both with higher and lower GPAs, have received the links. I'm also part of the placement Google group and I have received other emails, including the ones that say \"all registered students have been sent the link.\" I’ve tried contacting coordinators via email/WhatsApp but haven't gotten any clear responses. If anyone has faced something similar or knows how to resolve this, any help would be appreciated."
