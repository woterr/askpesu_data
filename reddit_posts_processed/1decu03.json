But exposures are good\nâ””â”€â”€ Thank you...how was the interview? Was it difficult?\n    â””â”€â”€ It was moderate you got to know what your saying, wbu are yous selected?\n        â””â”€â”€ No, i was planning to apply to pes..so i wanted to know how it is there before applying\n            â””â”€â”€ It would be fairly decent, people would be nice there's a lot of intake of people so it all depends on the friends you make, have you applied elsewhere?\n                â””â”€â”€ I have written cuet...I wanted to apply for christ but I got to know about it after they closed applications...so i thought of pes for backup\n                    â””â”€â”€ Same man, I wrote christ I got Delhi ncr but couldn't join due to  some issues, other colleges like mcc have ba which is not what I wanted, ramaiah has bsc but couldn't find reviews on it\n                        â””â”€â”€ Can relate to u so much... it's tough to find bsc psychology\n                            â””â”€â”€ Take the interview, if you get in it would be honestly fine\n                                â””â”€â”€ Hey... Which clg did u choose now?\n                                    â””â”€â”€ Pesu\n                                        â””â”€â”€ How's pes? Is it worth joining?\n                                            â””â”€â”€ I kinda like it ,but it has its flaws\n                                                â””â”€â”€ Currently I'm in 12th pcmb.... Planning to join pes next year for bsc psychology... Is it worth joining or should I check any other universities?\n                                                    â””â”€â”€ I honestly think course is decent and all ,but for the best all around thing Iâ€™d say try Christ first and ask people their for the course ,from what I heard itâ€™s chill and good but also attendance is more and it can get hectic a lot too ,Pes is also good option ,if you canâ€™t get in\n                                                        â””â”€â”€ Christ was my first option... But christ kengeri is too far.. I would waste half of my day in travelling... And ppl said Christ bgr isn't tht great... So confused abt it ðŸ«  MCC and St Joseph doesn't hv bsc psychology...\n                                                            â””â”€â”€ Yeah thatâ€™s what I thought too\n                                                                â””â”€â”€ So what's the criteria to get into pes? What's the percentage required?\n                                                                    â””â”€â”€ should be above 60 , have to Pessat ig from next year or maybe not ,it was not their for me and you have to give an interview\n                                                                        â””â”€â”€ How was the interview?
