I also did some other certifications on Biotech, which is my Btech stream.\n\nTry for courses that will equip u with good CS skills. Focus on languages like Python,SQL,etc. They are very handy for placements. It's not rlly necessary to join courses related to ur stream (if u r non-cs student) in first year as u will learn things from your second year, but u can if u are interested. That can help you stay ahead in class and save you some time in further semesters as things can become hectic."
