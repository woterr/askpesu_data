  "title": "[Discussion] Confused Between Colleges for CSE – Prioritizing Good Campus Life, Hackathons, and GATE Prep",
  "content": "Hey everyone,  \nI’m in a bit of a dilemma and could really use some advice from people with experience.\n\nI’m only interested in Computer Science and related specializations — not open to any other branch (i am bad at anything else). Based on my KCET rank, I’m comfortably getting into most of the \"big name\" Bangalore colleges like BMSCE, RIT, and PESU (South campus), but unfortunately not RVCE.\n\nHere’s what I’m looking for:\n\n* **My top priority is a decent, balanced campus life** — I don’t want a super strict or toxic environment.\n* I want exposure to **good coding culture, hackathons, project-based learning, and competitions**.\n* I'm **not overly concerned about placements**, because I’ve already started preparing for **GATE**, and I’m quite set on pursuing [M.Tech](http://M.Tech) in the future.\n* So the only thing I want from my undergrad is a **supportive environment** for GATE prep, coding events, and personal growth — not just marks and mass recruiters.\n\nIf you’re someone studying or who has studied at any of these colleges (BMSCE, RIT, PESU, or others in Bangalore), I’d love to hear:\n\n* How is the **overall campus life**?\n* Are there **active clubs or communities for tech and competitions**?\n* How much **freedom/flexibility** do students get?\n* Any unexpected pros/cons that you’ve seen?\n\nAppreciate any insights — I’m trying to make a decision that aligns with my long-term goals, not just brand names.",

      "body": "Hi u/SwarnavChand, your post was temporarily held for moderator review because it mentions topics related to admissions, which automatically flags it for review. \n\nPosts involving admissions are treated with particular care on this subreddit due to the high potential for misinformation during high-stress times of counseling, seat allotment and critical decision-making periods.\n\nUnfortunately, we've seen how easily inaccurate or speculative advice spreads in such environments. Users frequently make major decisions about their future based on what they read online, often from fellow aspirants who may not have access to accurate information. This leads to confusion, false expectations, and in many cases, regret. Since this is the first year PES is using JEE and CET for admissions, the risk of misinformation is even greater and there simply isn't enough reliable historical data for anyone to make trustworthy predictions or statements.\n\nFor these reasons, all posts that fall under the category of admissions must go through moderator review and fact-checking before they are visible to the community. This is not meant to restrict discussion but to ensure that the advice shared here is grounded in verified knowledge and does not unintentionally mislead other students. Posts that speculate on admission procedures, branch allocation, share personal rank-based predictions, or solicit counseling advice from the crowd will generally not be approved, unless they clearly offer helpful, factual insights without creating confusion.\n\nIf you're looking for real data, refer to this post: [Which branch can I get? (PESSAT 2022 cutoffs)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/1ct5ujc/which_branch_can_i_get_at_no_dont_make_such_posts/)\n\nWe appreciate your understanding and cooperation. These policies are designed to protect not just you, but the entire community, from the harm that misinformation can cause during such a critical time. Please respect the rules and seek guidance from trusted sources. Attempts to bypass this filter may result in a 30-day ban or longer for repeat offenders.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Everything that you have asked for - campus life, clubs, freedom and pros/cons - all of them have either been discussed multiple times in various posts, or have a dedicated FAQ for it. Please use these resources before posting duplicate questions.\n└── I apologize I am very new into using reddit and finding my way here can be really confusing. It would be really helpful if you could attached the post links of the above mentioned answers which are already available. Furthermore I will try my best into using these resources to its best without being a bother. Once again sorry\n    └── Nobody is going to spoon feed you, you're old enough to figure this out. Visit the home page of the subreddit - r/PESU. You will find links there for various resources, including the FAQs (difficult to miss it since it's the first thing you see). The same page also has a search bar which you can use to query with relevant keywords and get your answers."

You haven't even entered college yet. It's fine if you want to think that you want to do masters in the future, but are you don't seem to have mentioned any research aspirations anywhere so I doubt its for that\n└── Your question is valid. Actually I have an elder sister who is already doing Mtech from IITK and has given me contacts of CSE seniors, who have given me the sources and guide for preparing from first year. So far it's going well. I didn't mention any research interest because it was not really the topic for which I was looking for suggestions, because that would be too far fetched for now.\n    └── No, I'm just curious as to why you want a MTech so much that you have started preparing for GATE so early. Especially considering GATE syllabus is based on what you learn in BTech/BE, where I'd assume actual engineering classrooms or assignments to be more useful in learning for whatever branch, than some coaching center-like material\n        └── It's practically in our culture to turn everything into a rat race\n            └── ![gif](giphy|PMxnYeZ3q2ZUBcRip9)"
