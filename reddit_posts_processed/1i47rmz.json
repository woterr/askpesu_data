  "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve registered for PES admissions through their official website, paid around ₹1200 as the application fee, and received my application form and confirmation email with all my student details.This isn’t for a management seat.\nWhile logging in, they asked me to select whether I’ll write KCET, JEE, or both and further process will be done after the results as per the website... \nEverything seems legitimate—I’ve got my details and confirmation via email. But I want to double-check with you all: is this normal for PES admissions? Or should I be concerned about whether it’s fake?",

If you still are worried, drop a screenshot of your confirmation on the dashboard.   \nIf that still doesn't help, call up the office once!\n└── Glad to know I am not the only one\nThank God!!\n    └── relax\n        └── Yep :)"

      "body": "Why do they need u to register thru their site for kcet admission, afaik its directly thru kcet counselling.\n└── Yeah, I was confused about that too at first. But I think the registration on their site is just to create a student profile and link it to KCET or JEE later. The actual admission through KCET will still happen via the counseling process???\nAnyways I've already applied and paid the amount too..Even if it's of no use..I can't do anything 🥲\n    └── >But I think the registration on their site is just to create a student profile and link it to KCET or JEE later.\n\nNo its some different quota where u pay around 5lpa/year as academic fees. The cutoff for kcet in this case would be higher in number.\n\n>The actual admission through KCET will still happen via the counseling process??? \n\nYeah basically the entire thing.\n\nI'd suggest dont apply explicitly for any other k'taka state clg (which are under kcet counselling)\n        └── Got it...\n            └── Another thing:\n\nIn the coming months u will see many irrelevant people offering paid counselling guidance, dont register anywhere. Ask the subs, or any senior. They can guide far better than them for free."
