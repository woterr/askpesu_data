If I'm not wrong, your grade will be entirely dependent on that exam and previous assignment marks or isa marks won't count. (Someone pls crct me if I'm wrong) , so please talk to your mentor/faculty advisor and make an informed decision.\n                └── I thought of doing but now I decided to not"

They're normal courses too.\n│       └── So if we drop a special topic we won't get a backlog right ,for example this semester we have 22+2 , (2)being the special topic if we drop this special topic will it be 22/22 or 22/24\n├── Will it be f grade?\n│   └── If you withdraw, it shows a W grade, not F.\n│       └── What about drop\n│           └── won't show up as a course at all, i think. I've only withdrawn a subject, I've never dropped so I'm not really sure\n│               ├── so, when you can write the withdrawn course?\n│               ├── so, when you can write the withdrawn course?\n│               ├── so, when you can write the withdrawn course?\n│               └── so, when you can write the withdrawn course?\n└── Bruh will there be any problem later if we withdraw?I mean will that be considered as backlog??\n    ├── No problem, but yes you'll have to write it later as a backlog and also pay Rs250/- per credit.\n    │   └── And how will that affect the gpa?(ps:dont mind me i am absolutely new to all these..and none of my friends have a clue abt this)\n    │       └── Cgpa will be lesser of course, because you haven't written a certain number of credits. Once you write the paper at a later time, gpa increases according to the grade you've scored.\n    └── Not a backlog, but you'll need to clear it before you can get your degree. Ideally before 6th sem or so because that's when companies start visiting for summer internship too"
