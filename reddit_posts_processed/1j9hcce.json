If it's a physical health related issue, (something extreme like cancer) there's a good chance they will allow you to take time off of college. Although you will still pass out in 2028 like the rest of us, it's a relaxation on classes, ISAs and assignments.\n└── >Although you will still pass out in 2028 like the rest of us, it's a relaxation on classes, ISAs and assignments.\n\nDo you have any proof to support this?\n    └── yea ik a few people who've dealt with severe fractures and have gotten a relaxation on attendance... and any exam(s) which they couldn't attend, the weightage was added to ESAs."
