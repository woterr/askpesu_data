They   were ruled out by default xd as I wouldn't match cutoffs. I could get VIT VIIT SPIT  etc but those institutes feel L for me. Same goes in comedk too Had got bmsce alloted in Round 2 but wanted msrit cse core so I rejected that seat .\n        â””â”€â”€ Which is better coep ,vjti or rv,pes\n            â””â”€â”€ Depends totally , COEP and PES are on same level. When it comes to RV and VJTI it's a tough competition mate , coz VJTI surpassed RVs placements stats for on going Placement season afaik. So it's like VJTI > RV > PES = COEP ( placements wise , campus life wise PES is better )\n                â””â”€â”€ Oh nice thought coep was the best mmhtcet college\n                    â””â”€â”€ Not at all defaming coep , it's a great college ."
