      "body": "You can write backlog exams any number of times, but remember that it is not free. You need to clear all backlogs by the time 8th semester ends to get your degree. Note that if you have any active backlog during your 7th or 8th semester you will also not be eligible to sit for placements, so ideally you would want to clear all by the time 6th semester ends.\n├── Thank you for clearing! Does it affect the overall grades , putting aside there's a backlog. I mean like negative marking.\n│   └── Nope. Once you clear a backlog there is no sign of it. Your marksheet will contain the same information as someone who did not have one.\n│       ├── Thank you!\n│       └── Not entirely true, they put in year/sem of clearing the backlog. If you take multiple stabs at it, the year changes. No one really looks that deep into it, but yeah not exactly the same. I had 5 which took me a few to complete.\n└── How much we have to pay to clear one subject backlog\n    └── You can't pay and clear a backlog, if that's what you're question is. You however still need to pay an exam fee (1000 per credit or something) and give the exam as well"
