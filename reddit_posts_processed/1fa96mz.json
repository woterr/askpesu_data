Ec cs does have a slight edge tho\n└── I've heard now aiml is basically 95% core, so u thought it won't be an issue\n    └── It's 100% core. Only differenc is electives and the degree has aiml in it. It's a very small difference and if u save more than 30 minutes a day going to rr, I'd pick rr\n        └── I'd save more than an hour lol, I might have to take hostel for ec\n            └── I'd definitely recommend rr then\n                └── it won't affect masters if aiml itself right\n                    └── In most colleges, should not. Very few might care . They usually just look at coursework which isn't a problem here"
