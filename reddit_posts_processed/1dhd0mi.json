You can also try for branch change to any CS branch. If you get any CS branch at EC or RR, then it will be a win in every way.\nâ””â”€â”€ I like BT cause it's my passion I don't want to work in a corporate from 9 to 5.                                                                            \n(My rank is 5k+)\n    â””â”€â”€ Oh, I was just playing into the bit.
