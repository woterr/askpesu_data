It has 60 videos.\n\nThey also cancelled crypto later and made those students take blockchain. Other DIS also were too hard. ",

Dist systems has 20 videos and 1.5 hours each whereas blockchain has 57 videos with 30 mins each. \n\nHowever, I don't know if it's lengthier than the crypto course. Either ways, they've given such less options this time ;-;\n\nI feel ya"
