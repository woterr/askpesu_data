Don't leave it up to a single poll to decide where you would go.\n├── I don't mind an academic focus college , I don't care about fests either \nbut I do want some time for myself to learn some other things that's all\nDoes pes give you free time?\n\nThanks Mr cuminabag :(\n│   └── From what I have heard from other seniors you have a lot of projects to do during your \"free time\" but these are relevant and something that highly improve your value to a company\n└── Yeah the same question, does pes give free time, or the competition is too overwhelming?\n    └── Free time isn't related to competition though. Competition is high here. As for free time, not too much. Throughout the semester you are occupied with work.\n        └── What i meant to say is , if there is a lot of competition then the cgpa that can be called as good cgpa  increases , so you would need to invest more time to secure that cgpa"
