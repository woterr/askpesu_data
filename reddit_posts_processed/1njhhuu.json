I faced the same issue in ibm. Passed all the best cases still couldn't get shortlisted.\n    â””â”€â”€ Did better means : \n1) quicker \n2) changed code to avoid ai checkers if ai checkers were used\n        â””â”€â”€ Quicker isn't criteria afaik. Coz I know few people who couldn't even pass some test cases and got shortlisted\n            â””â”€â”€ Some companies use ai checkers heavily eliminating most, so in those cases that could happen\n                â””â”€â”€ Yeah makes sense"

Atleast that's what I noticed among the people I know. \n\nIf you're shit you won't get shit. I know a guy who cheats in God knows what way, but he got like 6+ interviews or so. Somehow messed up everything\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Know who you are talking about ðŸ‘€ðŸ˜­\nâ”œâ”€â”€ I know who you are talking aboutt!!!\nâ””â”€â”€ Isnt this an ec campus guyðŸ˜­"
