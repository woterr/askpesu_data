The teacher quality has become much worse compared to pre covid times. We are just paying for placements\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ I'd say it's worth it if you're from CET though. Pretty affordable and you get great placement opportunities.\nâ””â”€â”€ Alright"

You can definitely get CSE for 96%ile. But keep in mind that the fees is more if you go through mains, it's 5L per annum excluding hostel fees i believe."
