  "content": "I have joined PES RR this year, the internet captive portal only lets us login once (sometimes 2-3 times if we r lucky) in a day.\n\n  \nSO everytime I close my laptop or move to a different block it disconnects and asks for login. When I login it says that \"Max login limit reached'\n\n  \nWhat is the solution for this?",
