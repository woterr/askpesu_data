  "title": "Interview guidance needed for Salesforce AMTS Intern (Class of 2027) – Looking for serious preparation advice",
  "content": "I’m a 2nd-year B.Tech Computer Science student, graduating in 2027, and I’ve recently been considered for the Salesforce AMTS (Associate Member of Technical Staff) Software Engineering Intern role in Hyderabad/Bangalore.\n\nI’m reaching out here to get serious and structured advice from anyone who has gone through this interview process or is familiar with it. I would really appreciate your guidance on the following points:\n\t•\tWhat does the interview process usually involve? (Online test, technical rounds, behavioral interview, etc.)\n\t•\tWhat kind of DSA questions should I expect? If you recall any topics or examples (e.g., arrays, graphs, trees, dynamic programming, sliding window, etc.), please do share.\n\t•\tAre there questions on core CS subjects like OOP, DBMS, OS, and networking?\n\t•\tHow much weight do they give to projects or past work (even if academic)?\n\t•\tDo they ask anything related to Salesforce products, platforms, or company values? Should I go through their CRM, Trailhead, etc.?\n\t•\tWhich coding platform do they typically use for assessments (HackerRank, Codility, etc.)?\n\t•\tI have around a week to prepare — how should I best structure my time?\n\nIf anyone has recently gone through the AMTS intern process or knows what to expect, your insights would really help. I’m taking this very seriously and want to prepare as effectively as possible.\n\nThanks in advance for any help or advice!",
