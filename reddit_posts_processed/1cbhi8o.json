      "body": "1. Yes. Once you get an internship (on or off campus) and if you want to claim credits, then firstly it has to be paid and secondly it can only happen either in the summer before 7th sem or in 8th sem. \n2. If your internship satisfies these conditions, you'll need to fill out a form, create a report, fill in your manager details and submit it at the end of the internship. PES will contact your manager and ask them to rate you on several parameters, which is then converted into your internship grade. \n3. So your current internship won't actually give you credits because you don't satisfy any of the conditions in (1).\n└── This seems like outdated information, people who did internship after 4th sem were able to claim credits. (Batch of 25)\n    └── Ah okay. Does this apply for unpaid as well?\n        ├── No no only paid afaik\n        │   └── I heard that people got credits for unpaid internships if its in a reputed company like Cisco, or any big tech. is it true?\n        ├── Unpaid only if it's from some reputed institution like IISc afaik\n        └── Credits can be claimed from Unpaid internship, only if its from a reputed research organization like DRDO, ISRO etc"
