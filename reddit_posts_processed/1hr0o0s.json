I don't see what's wrong in that. Sure, you're at that age where doing things like this seen fun, but also have the balls to accept what you did was wrong after all the fun y'all had from throwing a bed.\n\nTo all the people who are saying things like \"it ain't that deep\", know that you guys are promoting and defending public vandalism. This is exactly what the vandals who break damage buses and cars during strikes say.\n\nY'all asking Rowlet to grow up, blud y'all the ones who've to grow up. What do you even mean by \"this was common in my parents time, I don't see what's wrong\". Oh you don't wanna get me started on what else was common in your parents' time :D\n\nIf you guys feel so right about it, then maybe you should have done it at your home, with your own bed. Hypocrites \n\nThe next post is gonna be about how the hostel & PES rules are strict as fuck lmfao. No shit sherlock. Y'all are the exact reason why we can never have fun things",

Boys hostels have been doing messed up things since generations, at least ragging is a lot less in the newer batches.   \nI think its not just this generation but most of us Indians have zero respect for property that does not belong to us, u can see it in all age groups.   \nBut yes rowlet's points stand.\n├── \nLike you’ve concluded your comment, he didn’t say anything wrong.
