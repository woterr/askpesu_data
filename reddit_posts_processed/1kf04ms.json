  "content": "Could you tell me about the ECE department at PESâ€”regarding the teaching, placement opportunities, and long-term scope of the field? I've been hearing that ECE-related jobs are expected to grow significantly in the coming years due to government support and expanding tech industries. Also, considering that the job market for CS engineers is becoming more saturated and competitive, especially with the rise of AI, would choosing ECE over CS be a better decision in the next 2 years?",
