Maybe someone who expected around 35-40 range and expected a backlog ended up passing could answer. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(If we get proper answers then this post could also go in the FAQs page for others.)",

It will only be clear once people get their grade sheet and the passing grade's marks are mentioned on the back. The usual passing marks is 40, so assume it to be that for now. Stop posting repeated questions, you're adding to the redundancy you are complaining about. Any more posts on passing marks will be deleted by the mods."
