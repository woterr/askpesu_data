The formula for SGPA (weighted average of grades where the weights are credits) never changes. You need to do well in your overall score for a course to get a good grade for that course, which means you also need to do well in all the components for that course. \n\nAlthough, doing well in most of the components gives you a *little* room to screw up the remaining component. You can either do really well in ISAs and then afford to not do that well in ESA and still get an A grade for the course. Regardless, try to maximise marks in the lab/assignment/project components. These are direct marks and are scoring areas for any course."
