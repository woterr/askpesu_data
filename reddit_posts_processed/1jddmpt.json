Javahar actually laughed during an orientation addressing this. \nIf you meant the management course then idk.\n├── Wait, can you explain me more about Jawahar laughing it off?\n│   └── One of the suicides in campus was due to some 'love problem'. Man dismissed all the other suicides with  making fun of this one.\n│       └── That's messed up, but after hearing about the recent news, I almost wonder if what happened was an act of karma...\n│           └── Don't think that man. God know he's become more deranged now that he owns the university in name as well\n└── What about faculty"
