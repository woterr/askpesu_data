Second i think mostly yes\nâ””â”€â”€ is it better to directly go for round 2 i have 35xx rank\n    â”œâ”€â”€ Last year I heard they pulled a scam where they moved pessat seats to management after round 1\n\nSo there were abnormally few and even negative seats left for round 2. \n\nDon't take the risk. You have a good chance as getting cs or aiml at ec campus\n    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ oh okay thanks and what is the refund policy can i withdraw my seat afterwards ?\n    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ You will be charged 10k and the rest will be refunded if you cancel.\n    â”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ okay thanks\n    â”‚           â””â”€â”€ How much time does It take for the refund to be reflected in my account, I mean do they do it as soon as I withdraw the seat or when the whole counselling process is done\n    â”‚               â””â”€â”€ It will take a little bit of time, I am not sure how long it took.\n    â”œâ”€â”€ Go and Speak to PESU asking Why they Scam Seats In Round 2 Bro.\n    â””â”€â”€ go round 1  \nyou cann pay and refund if you dont want to do in pes\n        â””â”€â”€ T\n            â””â”€â”€ cfbr"
