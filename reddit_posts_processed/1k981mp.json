      "body": "I did this \"internship\" in the summer after my 4th sem, they expect you to show up literally 9 to 5 for like 6 weeks from I think second week to June. \n\nIt's not bad if you have a good teammate and a decent mentor who can guide you through your project and writing research paper, if not it'll be the worst experience ever. \n\nOne good thing that came out of this for me, is that they added the 2 internship credits (S grade) to my sem 5 sgpa which helped me out a lot."
