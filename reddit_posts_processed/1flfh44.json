Just a handful of decent teachers for a batch of 700+. \n\nCan't comment on ECE teachers since I'm in CS but I've heard the ECE teachers at EC campus are better than the ECE teachers at RR campus.\nâ””â”€â”€ what about RR vs EC Cse profs\n    â””â”€â”€ Rr will be better but honestly not by a lot. Very soon ull realise that teachers don't matter and ull have to study most things on ur own.\n        â””â”€â”€ Okie"
