Cons exist for literally every college, atleast for PES you have support groups :P\n├── >peer group of PES is better\n\nDoesnt BMSCE has a much better peer group than the electronic City campus??\n\n>PES has really good CSE placements\n\nDoesn't BMSCE have the same thing?\n│   ├── As far as I am aware in placements rv>=pes>bms>msr\n│   └── Pes placements are better but bmsce>>>pes e city. Ig its easier to get placed at bms than at ecity coz of second branch+ crowd although placements take place together.\n│       └── What makes you say that placements at bms is better than pes ec campus? As far as I know placements in both campuses are similar.\n│           └── Some senior from pes gave me a range of expected/average(sumn i dont rem) package in pes ec and pes rr . The ec campus was like 2 lpa lower(he seems legit).\n│               ├── What does CSE average package look like in ec campus?\n│               │   ├── I dont remember that guy apparently has some yt channel where he shoots videos for colleges\n│               │   │   └── Mate xD\n\nBelieve us, we have been there 😂\n│               │   │       └── Ofcourse you know better . Im only saying what I've heard.\nI have no backing.\n│               │   └── Placements are pooled, it doesn't matter what the average at EC campus is because there is no way to find out that information. Companies don't know which campus you're from during placements\n│               └── This isn't accurate though, cause placements are pooled. Recruiters from companies aren't made aware of which campus the students are from. There is no difference made from the company's end. I've explained this on the subreddit before mathematically.\n│                   └── Fairs but revrecords on yt said me that\n│                       └── Correlation doesn't imply causation. There is a statistical reason behind why the trend exists, and it's not because companies identify you as an ECC kid. To explain at a surface level: more kids in RR than ECC -> less kids from ECC get the higher packages -> average decreases for ECC.\n├── Brother thank you \nWhich year are you brother\n│   └── I have graduated my brother\n└── As the designated Rowley Anna, I confirm with this xD"
