The management changed 2-3 years ago and that's when all the good teachers started leaving the college. Plus the huge intake of students will affect your placements as you'll have more competition. PES could very well turn into VIT in some time. If I were you, I'd try for colleges like RVCE and BMSCE instead. \n\nThis is just my opinion but I'd highly suggest you do your own research. There are many similar posts answering your question on this subreddit.\nGood luck.\n├── Even in BMS Many Good teachers left I have friends there and Intake Is Increased in BMS and RV also But Not as Much as PES. For Your Kind Information. Every One have a Time to retire everyone can't work forever they have to retire and that's the reason why some of the teachers left it's not because of management change For your Kind Information.\n│   └── Whether you like it or not, as your senior, I've certainly seen more of this college than you (for your kind information). And I've also seen teachers well below their retirement age leaving this college (not for your kind information this time cuz why should I be kind to you?)\n│       ├── No I will be going to college this year so I just asked to clear out my confusion 😭\n│       │   └── Everyone will have a different opinion about the colleges, people say pes is bad but i have also seen ppl say pes is good, it is completely upto u which one to listen and yea, its not like pes is the only college which has problems, u will find problems in any college, not all colleges r perfect, its upto u on to decide, make ur decision wisely, thats all i would say\n│       └── Adding to this: most of the profs who have left have gone back to join the industry, not retire and live out their golden years. \n\nu/ContactBeginning6119, If you don't even know who has left, then why bother to comment about why they left?\n└── Bro people with money can stay anywhere. Not necessary wrt the quality of teaching or others"

It's not all good, like any other college it has its pros and cons. Everyone can sugarcoat it but knowing the reality is why I assume you're on this sub.

They were acknowledged the day the incidents happened and were out on the news the very same day. They handled it poorly, but they never covered it.\n│   ├── They tried to cover the suicide up. Know your facts.

Unlike a lot of people on this sub, I ensure to keep my comments neutral and objective. Just because PES gets a lot of shit wrong doesn't mean it deserves comments which are untrue.

Teachers anyway hardly matter as at the end majority of the people study on their own no matter how good the teacher is, u will adapt to this once u reach college it's not like jee or cet where u have someone to spoonfeed u.
