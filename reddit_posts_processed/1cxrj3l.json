Not incoming.\n        ├── What’s the approximate ratio in cs? (Asking as a girl who wants to make friends)\n        │   └── The 2022 outgoing batch had about 60 kids per section on average, with about 15-20 girls and remaining 40-45 boys in each.\n        │       └── Are these sections ranked based on performance or is it just randomly sorted?  \nI'm getting CS so curious.\n        │           ├── Based on Alphabetical order and Branch\n        │           │   ├── Arrigato senpai\n        │           │   │   └── mondainai kun/chan\n        │           │   └── Can i dm\n        │           │       └── Me?\n        │           │           └── Nah\n        │           └── So say there are two sections. When you join, everybody is ranked. \nRank 1 goes to section A, rank 2 goes to B, and so on. That's how they didn't for 2022 outgoing. CET students are put after PESU students, then comes diploma students in the second year.\n        │               └── Oh okay, that makes sense. What about those who get in through mains? Any idea? cuz I don't think that option was there when the batch of 22 joined.\n        │                   └── Yes, I'm not so sure about that. It would probably be a similar order\n        │                       └── Thanks\n        └── Oh then the ratio must've improved now?\n            └── Usually doesn't change by much\n                └── Thanks"
