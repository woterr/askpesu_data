Then yes they will be competing with core CS and their own branch (along with ECE and other branches that are allowed to sit). \n\nScholarships? No, Scholarships are always intra-department. \n\nPESU trauma? That hits everyone here :')\n└── thanks:) I was just wondering about the GPA, though; would the student's GPA be wrt their aiml batchmates (some 300 of them) or wrt cs+ cs(aiml) (some 1k+ students) in a particular campus?\n    └── GPA is not relative, it's absolute. So it's irrelevant. There's an FAQ post on this sub that explains the calculation of GPA if you're interested.\n        └── Ah okay, sorry, my bad... will check it out. Thank you"
