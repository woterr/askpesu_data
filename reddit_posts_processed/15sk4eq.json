But my parents want me to join cs in pes ec campus.\nâ””â”€â”€ \\+1 same rank bruv parents insist on me taking pure cs.. ecity appears to be the only available college at that rank (uvce and jss are unpreferred, by family)\n    â”œâ”€â”€ I think you should prefer PES ecity because both campus have placements together\n    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Yup..\n    â””â”€â”€ Exactly. I got uvce in mock. But my parents don't want me to join it.."

      "body": "If placements is your only goal go for PES .\nIf you want balanced college and academic life I would suggest BMSCE . BMSCE too has good placements but not upto the mark of PES yet but it is catching up.\nMy friends in bmsce say companies which come for hiring allow both cse and ise students. Syllabus wise there is a difference of few subjects and electives but the core remains the same. Overall I would suggest BMSCE(don't know whether you'll get it at 2700 rank in kcet)\nâ””â”€â”€ Placement bro,college life,not interested at least now,let me repent later lol\n    â””â”€â”€ You're probably gonna regret that after 4 yrs\n        â””â”€â”€ i knowðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­"
