We had to write the code on the answer booklet and execute and show it on the system. It's a very easy exam dw about it too much. U can sneak your phone inside if you're feeling brave, a lot of us did it.\n└── They have us giving it like an isa....\nFrom seating to batches\n    └── Then ig u just write the code and submit it. Good luck!"
