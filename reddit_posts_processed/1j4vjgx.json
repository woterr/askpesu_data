I mean, I know when other colleges gave holidays and PES didn't, ppl said they wouldn't give a holiday even if Doreswamy died, and while that's acceptable, guys, he actually passed away now. Making jokes or  treating it like this, asking about holidays or mrd scholarship and what not, is in such poor taste. A little respect please 🙏\n├── Wait well who made a joke now?\n└── Respect? Do you think he cared when one of us died? Do you think it concerns him when someone in PES commits suicide? Why should we be concered then? Respect goes both ways,stop idealizing the rich.\n    ├── Bro just read what you said. Really questionable morale\n    ├── i’m usually the last person to say anything positive about this college, but come on man you're talking as if he was a fucking war criminal or something. get a grip\n    ├── Death needs to be respected irrespective of class. Think next time before you type.\n    ├── Do you really think the management has a personal vendetta against you all? Don't be a fucking clown.\n    ├── Maybe they don't care about pes suicides, maybe they do. End of the day, do you know any other college that gives as many scholarships as PES does? They're clearly trying to motivate us. \nAnd we all willingly joined PES right? They did warn us that it'll be hectic. Maybe in some cases, the student didn't have a choice as their parents or family forced them, but that's definitely not on PES. \nThis is not the time or the place for this argument. You wanna talk about idealizing the rich, do it when someone hasn't just passed away. To his family, he's still the person they love and THAT is something we should respect.\n    ├── You should be barred from scholarships and use of any facility offered by the college. Maybe stop wearing tinted glasses which only see the bad. Don't try take the moral high ground either we all know you also don't give a flying shit about any suicide its just another leeway for you to shit on the college. The founder of one of the if not the best college in Banglore has just passed away and you are making this about idealizing the rich? get a fucking life\n    └── Bruh are you mentally retarded by any chance."

The first time, my grandfather asked me to touch his feet, since my education (and therefore, my future) was in part due to his vision and ideas. He said that MRD's blessings were something I shouldn't miss.\n\nI've voted 4 times in my life, and coincidentally, I've met him and received his blessings every time. I've done well since, and even though I'm not a very religious or \"sanskari\" person, I am very thankful for him. Not just for myself, but also for the fact that he had a major role in the education of tens of thousands (maybe even lakhs) of students in Karnataka and beyond.\n\nMay he rest in peace.\n├── That's a really touching story, I'm sure there are many others (me included) who thank him just the same. RIP\n└── Can students too go and pay respect to him, at his cremation place tomorrow??"
