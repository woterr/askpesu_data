      "body": "It depends which u get 1st , generally people say chem cycle is easier , but I had chem in 2nd sem they didn't do relative for certain subjects hence the grade went down\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Is it easier to score gpa in physics 2nd Sem or vice versa\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ It depends if u like / know C from before the only subject u need to put more effort is in phy rest all u can do it . And mechanical u need to mug so much stuff\nâ””â”€â”€ What exactly do they do in relative grading?\nI've heard seniors say that relative is not exactly relative in pes\n    â”œâ”€â”€ They increase everyones marks by certain number I guess , so that every1 gets better marks if the whole batch does bas in a subject\n    â””â”€â”€ The marks needed to get a particular grade is reduced. Suppose to an S grade you needed 90+, the number would be slightly lowered. So say 85+ would give an S.\n        â””â”€â”€ How frequently do they do this?\n            â””â”€â”€ Generally they do more in odd sems , but 2 subjects u can think off , in 1st year maths will be one and others will be c/phy etc"
