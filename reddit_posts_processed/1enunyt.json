  "content": "So I was joining pes only for the sole purpose of placement since the placement stats (excel sheet )were pretty convincing.\n\nBut I saw that the CSE intake is 1200(cs +aiml).\nAnd for 1200 students tier 1 placement has just 70 entries.\n\nAnd that is very low % of tier 1 placement ig.\n\nI wanna know if this is the complete tier 1 placements or there are other tier 1 students who haven't made entry here.\n\nAnd 1200 students is a lot BMS itself is 1500 and it is being shat on.\n\nThe competition here must also be crazy considering the student strength or the 1200 students do not even Get filled ?",

Which has seat matrix of 4k+ in cse & specializations only.. Intense competition but only 10-20% make out for tier 1 placements rest in medium or WITCHA mass recruitment\n\nNote : 500-600 including ( super dream, dream companies, WITCHA, starts up visit there)\n\nFirst CGPA screening so 9+ are 1k this year so they will be allow to seat in super dream / dream companies first... In that too screening above 9.4 allowed as par CGPA\n\nSo it open srcret Tnp and companies coming in campus do screening in large pool of tech batch Otherwise its not possible\n        â””â”€â”€ u/rowlet-owl\nThoughts on this?\n            â””â”€â”€ Happens at PES already, Many companies shortlist only those with 9+ CGPA or allow those with 8+ CGPA to even write the test. As the intake increases, these cutoffs will also increase.\n                â””â”€â”€ DamnðŸ¥²"
