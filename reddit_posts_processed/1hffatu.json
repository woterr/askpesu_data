Anyway if there's relative grading it will reduce\n        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Passing is 35.\nYou can find that In SGPA/CGPA calculator in FAQ section\n        â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Ahh OK mb\n        â””â”€â”€ I don't know if the passing mark is 35 or 40 but since that passing mark = isa1+isa2+assignment+esa whatever the passing mark is it should remain the same\n            â””â”€â”€ Finally, I'm going to pass .\nAppreciate it man"
