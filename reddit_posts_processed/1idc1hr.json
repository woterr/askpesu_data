That's what everyone does.\n│   │       └── Do we have to go and select the questions for re-eval like ISA or will they re-eval the entire paper??\n│   ├── Nope its 1000 for all of them now apparently a junior paid 3k for dbms,se and big data and as far as I remember dbms is a 5 cred course\n│   └── I don't think it's like that now, 4 and 5 credits all need 1000rs only for reval\n│       └── Hmm that's interesting. Thanks for the update.\n└── Is 1st sem ESA reval paid ?\n    ├── Yessir this is PES everything has a price. Even paper viewing costs 100 per paper\n    └── Yessir this is PES everything has a price.
