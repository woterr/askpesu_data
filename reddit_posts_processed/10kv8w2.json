      "body": "Usually if the difference between the required attendance and what you have is less they let it slide, or at most call you for makeup classes a week before your ESA (depending on if you can get close to the threshold with makeup classes - if your attendance is too low for even makeup classes to help, only then is action taken). If the threshold is 85% for you, just attend classes until it crosses 80% for that one course. Then the chances of you getting called for makeup classes will also not be there."
