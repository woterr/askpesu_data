Takes a lot more than a Bachelor's degree to get MLE roles.\n└── Other than masters does good enough experience help secure those ai/ml roles in the industry?\n    └── Pure ML/Scientist roles will always need a Master's (sometimes even a PhD). Any other kind of Applied AI/MLE roles might open up after a few years of industry experience, but even those need relevant ML engineering experience."

      "body": "Prepare for the \"SDE\" role, most of the companies come for SDE positions only. Few come for data science and AI/ML but the expectations are just too high for a final year student. SDE includes large scale real time projects, cloud hands-on experience, backend technologies, kafka or some type of load balancing, docker, jenkins, kubernetes, basically technologies that are actually used in the industry. So prepare accordingly"
