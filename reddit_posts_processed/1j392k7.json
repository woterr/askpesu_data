I’ve also built some really impressive projects.\n\nI’ve been actively looking for internships outside of college but haven’t had much success.\n\nAt this point, I’m wondering if campus placements could still land me a job because I’m exhausted from searching externally and the shitty CGPA of mine.\n\n\n\n",

But still sometimes they shortlist for test too, so tough luck there. \n\nBut dont lose hope and keep trying off and on campus both. And no, 7th and 8th gpa is not really considered in placements, maybe few companies that come in 8th sem might consider ur 7th sem GPA too\n        ├── Thanks..\nDo you know like how many companies keep the shortlisting below 6.5 itself.\nLike any rough estimate if you know.\n        └── Thanks for giving me some hope, lol.\n\nBy the way, do you know if there are any companies that set their shortlisting criteria below 6.5, or is it really rare?\n            ├── It's rare. The lowest I've seen is a 7.\n            │   ├── Ah okay 🥲\nI'm just fully cooked\n            │   │   └── Should've focused on your CGPA man. It's something we tell every batch when they join.\n            │   └── not rare, I doubt if there are any tbh.\n            └── Phonepe came with 6 cgpa. Buy i guess second round they filtered from higher gpa s .not sure"

Check the last year stats most of companies(90%) put a cut off of 7gpa or more. This doesnt mean you won't get placed, it means you will get less number of opportunities compared to others so for example if your friends are getting shortlisted for 5-6 interviews you on the other hand will get shortlisted for 1 or max 2 interview . So make sure you get your basics super clear and try to Crack those interviews. Atb"

I got an internship(off-campus) in a startup  at 7th sem, did not join as 7th sem college dont allow to claim credits + capstone headache.\nAsked them again in 8th sem for 6months. Currently doing the internship, fte based on performance.\n\n\nJust keep applying off campus. You might get somewhere. Search for referrals from friends and family.\n\nDont give up all the best👍\n└── Thanks"
