      "body": "Starts at 8 sharp in the morning. Classes go upto 3:15 in the noon. You usually get one half day with wednesday every week which is upto 1 pm. You get off on saturdays and sundays. There is an online class on saturday mornings. Usually 1.5-3 hours.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ It seems that in sem2.. classes start at 8:45 am (even sem)\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Wait what fr?\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ Yes, for btech odd sem starts at 8:00 and even sem at 8:45\nâ”‚           â””â”€â”€ And ending?\nâ”‚               â””â”€â”€ Few days 1:45, few 3:15, few 4:00, few 4:45. Just depends on your timetable. But 2 days half day applies for all semesters\nâ”‚                   â””â”€â”€ 4:45? Bro ðŸ’€ \nI'm hoping college bus timings also changes accordingly\nâ”œâ”€â”€ >You usually get two half days\n\nYo brother where is the 2nd half-day?\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Ours were on wednesday and friday as we had our classes till 4 pm on thursday\nâ”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Now this is the full comment but this type of timetable is for fewer sections\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ it depends on ur class, for example my class got another half on Tuesday.\nâ””â”€â”€ Same for sem 2?"
