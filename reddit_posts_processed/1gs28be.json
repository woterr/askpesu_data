  "content": "I'm really worried because my performance in isa 1 was abysmal, and I don't want this subject bringing down my cgpa. The syllabus is too vast for a single semester, and quite frankly difficult (At least for me since I don't have prior experience with web dev). And if someone can tell me important topics or something that come in exams often that would be great.",
