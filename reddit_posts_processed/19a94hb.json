      "body": "From my experience (and the one-time limited experience of viewing my paper), corrections are standard. You usually end up scoring as much as your answers deserve. They're not lenient, but they're not strict by any means either. They won't actively try to fail or pass you. If you write 3/4 points for an answer you usually end up with 3/4th marks. \n\nThat's not to say that mistakes in correction cannot occur. They do happen and are occasional. Evaluators have missed answers and sometimes even missed pages (this was back when my ESAs were pen-paper only, so if you didn't bubble a question number you practically didn't answer a question). But these are the usual mistakes, and not deliberate attempts to fail you. \n\nSo yeah, my experience has been pretty standard and normal if you could say. I think that goes for most people as well."
