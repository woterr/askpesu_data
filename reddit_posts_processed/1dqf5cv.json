Its worth 2 credits. There are other options you can choose from as well such as R, UNIX, etc. Most people choose C++ since its the most beneficial from a placements point of view. You can go through this subreddit - people have discussed special topics over the last few days. \n\nIf you want more details on special topics: [https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/1dnbx90/comment/la60k08/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/1dnbx90/comment/la60k08/)"
