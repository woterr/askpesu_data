If you donâ€™t want ur CGPA to get fkd then never ever dare to take DA. I would suggest BD is okay but DA is not. But still BD assignments are hard AF"

      "body": "As someone who has taken both, understand one thing. Both subjects are extremely hard. The concepts in DA itself are extremely hard to grasp and understand in a way that u can prepare for exams. Coming to BD, it is comparatively easier, but that is not by a lot.. the assignments and the final project in BD are quite hard, and even tho everyone is given the same questions, there is a plagiarism check done on the answers(which is quite stupid cause by and large the code doesn't change). The issue is in today's IT world both are quite important, and if u do take both, understand that ur CGPA will drop, and ur on campus placements will not be as good as others.. what I have personally done is, not sit for on campus placements, and instead applied directly to companies, and like that I have gotten around 3 offers, which I have taken an ML role in a mid size company. So if ur confident in ur skills, and during an interview answer the questions \"why is ur CGPA so low?\" Then tbh I would highly suggest taking both, but again that's only if u have a back up plan. Also the benefit of taking both is u get the ML certification or some specialisation right.. so there are pros and cons, talk to some professors and seniors (like me) and try to decide.. I think ull be fine tbh, cause y'all don't have 5 isas, 5 expt, 5 assignments and 1 MP per subject"
