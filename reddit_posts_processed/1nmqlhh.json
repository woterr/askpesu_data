No. Does not matter if the difference is substantial or not.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ This there has been no mention of dream tier for any company actually\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ That means none of the companies so far have been deemed to be dream companies by the placement cell. It's PES who decides if they are eligible to be in that tier.\nâ”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ Could you please let me know what the placement cell considers as the â€˜dream tierâ€™ cutoff?\nâ”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ It differs from batch to batch and depends on the CTC offered. I think it was >50L the last time I read about it.\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ Apple is dream tier, but it wasnâ€™t mentioned anywhere in any mail. So, many people who got placed thought they couldnâ€™t even sit for Apple, but apparently, they could.\nâ””â”€â”€ Is Confluent considered/was considered dream tier in the past? They are offering 33 Lakhs as base (not CTC)\n    â””â”€â”€ No, it wasn't considered."
