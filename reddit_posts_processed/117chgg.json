      "body": "Make notes. Will save u a big headache. Mech and physics are largely theory so focus on those from isa 1. Slides were enough for me to get 45+ in everything.\n└── should we focus on slides more or notes\n    └── Depends on the subject. For physics and math make hardcore notes in class and refer to slides for understanding gaps in your knowledge. Mech and electrical are largely learning byheart so i didn't bother making any notes and read only slides"
