  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm trying to decide between pursuing Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) at SJCE Mysore and PES University’s Electronic City campus. Both seem to have their pros and cons, but I'm having a tough time making a final decision.\n\nFor those who have experience or knowledge about these institutions, could you provide some insights on.\n\n- Quality of education and faculty\n- Placement opportunities\n- Campus life and extracurriculars\n- Overall reputation in the industry\n\nYour input would be really helpful in making an informed choice. Thanks in advance!",
