      "body": "Student of msrit here, let me share with you my story, my placements happened during the year 2020 which was the year of COVID, hence most companies weren't hiring as aggressively as they would. So companies that usually go to the top 4 colleges of bluru (rv, pes, bmsce msrit) only went to rv and pes that year. Hence the number of very high packages reduced quite a bit when compared to last year. Bottomline is I think brand matters, if you are really interested in the field that you would like to study in then PES is great despite the price. Also the pes brand afaik is also pretty popular abroad if you want to do masters.\n└── What is the average of MSRIT 2023 /2024 FOR CSE any idea on that ? I couldn't find the stats (branch wise)"

      "body": "It is worth it. The PES tag opens up way more opportunities in terms of jobs or applying abroad for masters compared to any other college in Bangalore. If you're in CSE or to some extent ECE. Not for other branches. If you have a 9+ CGPA (which is genuinely not hard to maintain, idk why everyone keeps crying about the stress and workload), you'll pretty comfortably secure a 20+ LPA package on graduating. So ROI is very good.\n\nPeople cry coz they want to cry. Is the college run by a tyrant and management is hopeless? Yes. Is the workload somewhat heavy and requires you to study more than just the day before the exam? Yes. But it's very much manageable and you'll also have a very good social life don't worry about it."
