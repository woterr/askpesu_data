But it just ends up being a lot of work. \nThe thing is that they expect a research paper to come out of your project. And doing a good project, enough to have a presentable paper, in the six weeks is tough. \nBut it's nothing too bad. This year it was 9-4 4 days a week. If you put all your efforts during that time right from the beginning you'll be good to go.\n        └── Oh okay got it thanks.  \nSadly I'd rather not be a part of it then considering I don't have much interest in research."
