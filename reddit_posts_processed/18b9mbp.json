Image Processing and Computer Vision\n4. NLP\n5. Digital Twin and xtended reality\n\nE4:\n1. Heterogeneous Parallelism\n2. Topics in Deep Learning\n3. Database Technologies\n4. Meta Learning for Graph Abstraction\n5. Information Security \n\nSo I also want to know if database technologies is a good course even for those who've taken Big Data for E2..how much more do we get to learn.",

And is DBT not worth it?\n    └── dbt doesn’t add much value, unless you badly need the gpa boost. hp not many took it but ig its for distsys enthusiasts\n        └── Hmhm also is IPCV good? Any opinions?\nJust trying to gather general perception..\nAnd like during 6th sem how much of our time gets occupied with capstone...\nAnd any general advice for us, where to spend time and stuff..\nCore subjects projects too..\n            └── core subjects semester projects are good, cloud computing hands-on was fun, ooad project could be resume worthy as you’re free to do anything, compiler design felt like a continuation of afll. Capstone you can manage, you don’t have to do it the whole sem, they expect some output by the end of 6th sem not the whole project\n\nTry getting a summer internship, helps if the company you intern at handout PPOs later. Some do, some don’t but if you get an opportunity in a company that gives out ppos to summer interns, you’re kinda sorted in 7th sem as well\n                └── Okok thanks"

Nlp has a good chance of converting your project into a paper.. otherwise ipcv is also a good choice.. jus do what u like don't worry abt marks and shi\n└── Ok but is tdl really worth it with respect to course quality? Because like MI doesn't seem soo nice because of the number of algorithms stuffed into one unit. \n Also MI faculty...very few of them really knew the math. I don't want it to be another \"learn how to use calculator fast\" course.\n\nBut ya electives we can at least choose our faculty. \nAny opinions on HP/ DBT?\n    ├── Aaa.. so basically for me atleast the thing came out that I liked ml and all those algorithms.. and yes it's a Lil heavy on the math side of things.. I mean internals are pretty chill in tdl.. but I heard dbt is easy so my thing is go for whatever you like or want to pursue.. hp o genuinely have no clue\n    │   └── Ok..and how are the labs and hands-on things? Good problem statements?\n    │       └── Yep.. they challenge you quite a bit.. so Lil bit u will need to think.. as for assignments and all we had only 2.. one hands on and 1 hackathon . Both were pretty good and fun to work on.. just manage your time with capstone and all you should be chilling\n    │           └── Thank you 👍\n    │               └── Np.. I personally took dl cause Im planning on pursuing a master's degree on it.. take what aligns with your goals\n    └── O and also any ml dl course is a lot of self study so if u do take it be prepared for that"
