  "content": "So I was at IISC fashion event ELEGANTE and I was one of the organisers for the event and I saw both panache and meraki’s performances \nThey had the same theme cyberpunk\nAfter panache’s performance the club head came and talked about the theme and complimented the  designers and makeup artists. \nAnd after meraki’s performance the club head came and told the same exact thing word to word. How’s that even possible . Like geez be original.\n\nAnyways I think panache had a way better performance choreography outfits everything included ",
