Is it really that much??\n                â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ig its 1.5k, 3k bohot hogya rightðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­\n                â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Lmao 720 cs core students in each pes campus\n                â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ so what should I choose?\n                â”‚   â”‚           â””â”€â”€ You'll prolly be at the top in ec campus if you take pes ec cs so that'll help deffo as You'll get a better cgpa as its mostly relative grading in most cycles so placements will be sorted\n                â”‚   â”‚               â””â”€â”€ And if you have financial constraints , kcet seat is a no Brainer as you'll be save up for masters /mba\n                â”‚   â”‚                   â””â”€â”€ oh it'd noy like I can't afford mit, but like the saved money will surely help\n                â”‚   â””â”€â”€ not a 100% sure, but this year i think its around 360 students per campus for cs through pessat\n                â””â”€â”€ In the seat matrix it's around 2k students, I think\n                    â””â”€â”€ You got to count in both the campuses, CSE + AIML, theyâ€™ll be management quota diploma entry students later.\n                        â””â”€â”€ Seat Matrix is like\n\nRR campus:-\n\nCSE- 720\nAIML- 480\n\nEC campus:-\n\nCSE- 720\nAIML- 240\n\nTotal- 2160\n\nI think this is the right one ðŸ™‚\n                            â”œâ”€â”€ It was 720 for CSE in RR campus for 20-24 batch, excluding management and diploma students \nNo fking way itâ€™s still the same\n                            â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ its the same bro\n                            â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Hmmmm but I think the total seats through the PESSAT in both campuses and both branches are \n360+360+264+132 = 1,116\n                            â”‚       â””â”€â”€ It is actually 288 + 288 + 192 + 96 = 864. They took in 360 + 360 + 264 + 132 during round 1 counselling coz they knew a lot of students would be surrendering their seats as the other counsellings began. The following is the seat matrix.\n\n[https://pes.edu/intake-of-courses/](https://pes.edu/intake-of-courses/)\n                            â””â”€â”€ then it'd pretty similar to manipal"
