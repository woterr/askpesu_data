Your campus/branch don't matter\n└── >If I remember correctly, changes from EC CSE to RR CSE are given more priority than complete branch changes. This will again put you at a disadvantage.\n\nThis is from the faqs.\n    └── It's wrong\n        ├── So can a student change from ec campus to rr campus or not?\n        │   └── Yes. The source is me. This is exactly what I did. \n\nBefore the second year starts some random number of people leave for whatever reason. \n\nAnd in the beginning of second year, they have a seat allotment and instead of rank it's based on your cgpa. \n\nIf a biotech guy has 10, he's the first rank essentially.\n        │       └── Thank you bro, I might get pes ec cse. I’ll try to change to pes rr cse if I can.\n        │           └── Arguably, PES EC CS is currently a better option if you are solely interested in tech.\n        │               └── I see. I have read ec campus has better tech related clubs and is more tech oriented. It’s just the distance, ec campus is 33km from where I live but rr campus is just 7 km.\n        │                   └── Ah thats a fair decision\n        └── Yeah, sorry about that. It used to be that way but things have changed. I will update this in the FAQs/"
