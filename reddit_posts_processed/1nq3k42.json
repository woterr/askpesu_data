  "content": "Today during the isa, i left the last bubble(and also didnt write in the box) of the course code empty as it was short of 2 more fields (it was an elective). I had asked the invigilator and he said to wait and he'll lmk but he nvr came and I also forgot about it. I wrote a mail to the coe and also submitted a letter, will it be corrected or not? If smth similar happened to someone you know please lmk what happened.",

Many people I know have written wrong SRNs n still got their paper evaluated. Also mailing the COE was a smart move, you're sorted in all ways tbh.\n\nBut how do you have this doubt now in 3rd year, when all ESAs it's the same case with insufficient boxes.\n└── I just had to leave out the A or B till now and that is kinda meaningless as there can oly be 1 sem going, but now its AA1 and AB1 so do i fill 1 or A, i still dk\n    └── Oh, my invigilators have always told me to write the missing letters outside the box. But yeah I get your POV. Atb"
