      "body": "ECE has the most number of professors with a doctorate degree so the pedagogy is really good. Course might go a bit tough in second year but you can work on many interesting projects with the professors out here. Placements are pretty decent. Quite a few make into the core companies while most IT companies open their doors fully for ECE students as well. So there's ample opportunities out here. You can also consider doing a minor degree in CSE to ace IT interviews peacefully."
