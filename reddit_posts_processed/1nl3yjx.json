      "body": "In WebTech, they’ll ask a few coding questions for 4 marks\n\nAs for DDCO… Unit 1 should be fine, but Unit 2 is BAD. Last time there was some question on registers or counters that no one could solve, and the infamous snail question (check the PYQs you’ll know). Read the textbook if you have time.\n\nHonestly just study as much as you can, then pray and show up. These subjects are absolute torture\n└── Thanks! What about DSA and AFLL? Do you remember any questions from ISA?\n    └── Yeah DSA 4 markers were all coding questions, directly from the slides. I remember them asking to code a circular linked list and an optimized bubble sort\n\nAFL was also everything from the slides. Just focus on that NFA DFA and minimization stuff. I don’t really remember the details\n        └── thank u"
