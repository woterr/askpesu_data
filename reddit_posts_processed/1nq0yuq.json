  "content": "Guys I lost my water bottle at around 12:30 PM today at the GJBC Library bag keeping area. I think someone may have accidentally taken it. It's a PES branded blue bottle. The paint is slightly faded. It has water in it. If anyone has any idea about it please do let me know. Also what official routes can I take to get it back?",
