It'll be during your ESAs\n└── So we'll get results too during ESA , I wanna know how bad I did in ISA2 so that I can do accordingly in ESA  but now I can't 🙂\n    └── That's a poor way to plan your efforts. \n\nYou should always give your 100% in every course. This includes the ISAs, assignments, project and ESA. It's the only guaranteed way to get a high GPA here. \n\nAlways aim high and put your best foot forward. The results will follow.\n        └── Yes Sir !!😊"
