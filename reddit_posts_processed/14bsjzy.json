Mine is 37xx but i didnt go to this round of counseling, just wanted to know if i can get cse(aiml) in ec campus or not.(in round 2 of counseling)\n├── Probably yes the last i saw it no one had taken AIML at EC rank is 16××\n└── Heard from person of 3.7k rank that aiml ec got over around 3.5k rank. So there is a real high chance for 2nd round as many will leave with kcet and comedk. Cse also is quite possible but depends on how many leave (cse ec got over 3.1k)"
