Things start to seem clear when you handle it one step at a time. \n\nEveryone needs time for themselves, and I suggest you dedicate quite some time to no one but yourself.\n\nP.S. even I was burnt out after 5th sem and pretty much just spent most of the sem break in some game or the other. Luckily, results were good and I feel like I've gathered myself enough to handle 6th sem. Stay strong, you'll pull through."
