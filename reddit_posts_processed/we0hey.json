It didn't have any attached documents or anything though.\n    └── That alone should be enough. You should mostly be having a week of activities for the bootstrap. So you'll be getting mails about that too. Sign up to PesuAcademy. When classes start you'll get info about your cycles and sections too.\n        └── So a printed screenshot is enough? Btw this is in regard to the documents to submit to the college.\n\nhttps://pes.edu/documents-to-submit/\n            └── Hmm I don't recall this. Must be a new add on. Sorry don't know about the admission order\n                └── K thanks anyway."
