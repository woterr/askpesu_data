      "body": "Usually Graph theory is supposed to be easier , but an anchor can make a huge difference in it . Big data by far was one of the interesting courses I took , but it's assignments and project take up a lot of time which we didn't have due to 5 isa's . Also the end semester paper for Big data for us was too hard (2024 batch) but was a breeze for the previous batches so you never know."

Big Data on the other hand might be medium difficulty, but I can assure you that it's one of the most interesting, practical and hands on courses you'll find. It's by far the most favourite course I took up and I'm super grateful I did because I still do use those concepts at my day to day job."
