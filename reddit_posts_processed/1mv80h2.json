A lot can happen in first year.  \nand branch change will be based on available seats + how your batch performs.\nâ””â”€â”€ So wait in 1st year people from different disciplines will be in the same classroom or will ece students will be grouped together?\n    â””â”€â”€ yes all branches in engineering will study in either phy/chem cycle for first year. third sem onwards you ll get  classes assigned according to your branch.\n        â””â”€â”€ How hard is branch change though If I may ask?"
