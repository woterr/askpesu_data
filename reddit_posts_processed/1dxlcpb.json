That's scam. Banda afford karne keliye scholly leta hai and they charge extra for getting scholly? \n\n\nDo they return back 10k after you are eligible for scholarship?\n│   │       └── Nope, they do not return the 10k if you are eligible. And neither do you get it back if you do not get the scholarship.
