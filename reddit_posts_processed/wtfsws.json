The amount is based on the tution fee paid for management quota\n└── Thats is pessat equivalent fee\n    └── I'm not sure of the fees now, but basically any scholarship amount is always calculated on the amount of tuition fees you paid. So it's different for CET/PESSAT/management quota kids\n        └── On the demand draft it says the tuition fee is 9.5 lakhs so will i get scholarship on that or the pessat equivalent which is 4.1??\n            └── Boss, its on the tuition fee that **you** pay. If you paid 9.5 as tuition fee then it is on 9.5 and so on."
