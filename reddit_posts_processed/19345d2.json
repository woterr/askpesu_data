What are the topics generally offered in summer?\n2. Is it compulsory to do either of the two (ST or smer course) for a given year?\n\n3.open to personal suggetions(the reason why I'm dropping is so that I can get time to work on DSA and other online courses,I suck at MERN and development in general, as a reason I don't really wish to take up GO/RUST/Java rather take up some other topic in the summer\n(Sry for the long post)",

Last time they provided mainly oop with C++ , IoT and many more. So it's best if you do two summer courses so you get 4 credits\n└── Oh thank u!!\n\n\n>either the option of doing atleast 2 summer courses\nJust wanna know if I can just opt one summer course and make up the 4th sem ST creds, bcz I already have 2 creds from 3rd sem special topics"
