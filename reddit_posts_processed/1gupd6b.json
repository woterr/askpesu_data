  "content": "After paying the fee during the cet counselling there was still a small amount needed to be paid to pes directly. So they sent an email with a pdf document that contained info about the amount needed to be paid. They also told that the payment needed to be done on the pesuacademy website in the \"online payments\" tab, but when i open it theres no prompt or anything that i can use to pay the amount. I tried contacting the accounts department but they never pick up the phone.\n\n  \nIt says \"paid\" in the screenshot but thats just the original fee that i paid during the cet counselling.\n\n  \nDoes anyone know how i can pay the remaining amount?\n\n",
