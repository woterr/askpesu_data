      "body": "Not a lot of people give pessat and it's shift based. Depending on the difficulty of your paper the marks may drop really low or really high. So just prepare well , answer as much as you can , and this year fee has been increased so ig the cutoff will drop. \nPessat cutoff for rr cse was 1.2k and ec was 3.3k (2nd round)\n└── are you sure its percentile and normalization process like JEE, rather than just marks vs rank like KCET??\n    └── Yes,  if you're in doubt , mail them.\nIt *has* to be a percentile system because pessat has a lot of shifts with different papers. If you're REALLY lucky you might clear the exam with minimal prep.\n\nMy friend last year who had a rank of 90k~ cleared pessat and got a branch in EC (I think AIML).\n        ├── Thanks man, really eased off some of my pressure.\n        │   └── When's your shift man?

They told me \"my rank in kcet was my question paper barcode number, but I cleared pessat and got a seat in EC campus\" \nAnd now they're telling me not to come to pes even if I clear the exam lmao\n                ├── praying for that kind of luck tomorrow man, thanks\n                │   └── Best of luck!!\n                │       └── thanks bro\n                └── can you ask why not to join??\n                    ├── Have you not read the posts here lmao , it's kind of a torturous place and all the good profs have left.
