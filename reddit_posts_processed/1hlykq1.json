  "content": "I like this girl , from 1st sem , weâ€™ve made eye contact so many times and in second sem I fortunately met her and befriended her but then I never told her that I liked her , in fact I acted as if Iâ€™m not at all interested in her.. \ncoz Iâ€™m scared that itâ€™ll fuck up our friendship . Things were like that , 3rd sem nothing actually happened we didnt even talk properly and Now Iâ€™m going to 4th sem . Itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m obsessed with her but idk sometimes I think that maybe i shouldâ€™ve done somethingâ€¦\n",
