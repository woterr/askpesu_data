      "body": "Yes, a 5 credit course would have more weightage in your SGPA than a 3 credit course. Your SGPA is calculated as sum(grade points obtained * credits for subject) / sum(credits). Therefore, you must put more effort studying courses with more credits as they contribute more towards your SGPA. With that being said, subjects with lesser credits are generally easy, and doing well in those subjects can compensate for poor performance in subjects with more credits.\n└── Thanks a lot"
