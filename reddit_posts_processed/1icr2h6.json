You will be able to retake those subjects whenever the backlight exams are held so take them up and do well in them. Try to clear your backlogs as soon as possible. One positive thing about backlogs are that, they don't consider your ISA marks or your internals, you will be graded out of the 100 marks you write the backlog exams for. If you manage to score S or A grades in them your gpa will increase. You can't change what has happened in the past you can only change your actions in the future, so be accountable and do not repeat what you've done so far. All the best!"

I think you already know the answer to whether the situation is bad. \n\nI've discussed this in an old comment of mine (go and search for it) but you need to really put in more hard work from next semester. Things are only going to get harder because first year is arguably the easiest and lightest year. So if you're struggling now, it's going to rain down trouble from 3rd sem. Figure out why you aren't scoring well and see if there are other contributing issues. \n\nYou need to introspect and reflect on why you performed terribly. You can definitely turn things around but you won't be able to do it unless you identify the mistakes you've made and why you've made them."

And in some of the harder subjects, I actually got a better grade than my friends because backlog papers are usually easier than ESA. In the end, me and my frnds ended up aith similar cgpa. Chill, don't stress too much. Think of backlogs as your second chance and don't fuck it up. You'll be fine. Cheer up!\n└── If I failed all my subjects in the first semester of a B.Tech program , will I be allowed to continue to the next semester?\n    └── Nope. They implemented a new vertical mobility system in my final year. If you have more than 24 credits back, you can't go forward until you clear them, so you'll probably have to write it with your juniors. Not the end of the world tho, ik 2 ppl who joined with me who are one year behind. They're chilling\n        └── \"Student Eligibility for Promotion to next higher semester (Vertical Mobility)\":\n\nA student will be promoted to next higher semester, if he/she has less than or equal to 24 pending credits (including F grade & W grade) from the previous semester/s. Any student having more than 24 pending credits (including F grade & W grade) from all previous/lower semesters will have to clear the subjects in the examinations whenever conducted next by the University. Once the student becomes eligible, he/she should enroll and continue in the next eligible semester as per academic calendar of the university.\nBro they had sent this"
