This year there have very less companies that have come, even those who came prefer B.Tech more \n\nAnd if you have less than 6 CGPA in 10th and 12th\nThen, it's a big problem for you\n\nIt's not like we aren't focused or don't care\nEven if you are well versed with Full Stack, can solve 100s of problems\nThey'd still remove you based on your 10th and 12th marks\n\nOverall, for placement I'd recommend getting referred by someone you know or try off campus since we've lost all hope on this college\n\n\n\nI hope I haven't scared you away\nIt's a good college but the pressure is high the moment you come, you gotta be competitive\n\nAll the best"
