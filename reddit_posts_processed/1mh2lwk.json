  "content": "Hi, I wanted to know if you're allowed to turn down the FTE part of a role when the job description is FTE + Internship? I've heard that some companies offer you FTE roles based on your internship performance, and some of them sign you on full-time from the get-go. How do you know which is which, and what do you do when you're interested in the internship, but you're not sure if you want to work there full-time? ",

Thank you for the response! "
