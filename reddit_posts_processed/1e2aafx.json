If people want to find a specific person on LinkedIn, it's as easy as searching for us on the site. If people want to generally search for alumni on LinkedIn, all they need to do is search for PESU and it'll load everyone.\n    ├── Yes, I agree, this will hinder privacy of seniors\n    └── Got it\n\nMakes sense \nPlan cancelled"
