Also relax, DSA is arguably the easiest course in CS.\n└── easy?☠️  \ni see pyq's and think why did i choose this branch\n    ├── Pyq before COVID are hella tough\n    │   └── What's pyq?\n    │       └── the full form? Previous year question?\n    └── Then you're going to have to put in more effort. DSA lays the foundation for not only future courses like DAA, Advanced Algo, etc but it's also fundamental for placements and clearing assessments and interviews, the latter of which require a higher-level problem solving ability that builds on the basics in this course."
