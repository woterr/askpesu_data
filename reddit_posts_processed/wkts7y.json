  "content": "so, i paid the amount required to get admission under management quota on 18th of July which is 22 days ago. I was told that i will get the confirmation within 10-15 days but I did'nt, so I went to pesu rr and they told me.... if your selected or not you will get an email by the end of this week and also mentioned that few students were not qualified so they had their money returned so i was nervous and in the end I didnt receive any further instructions from them. at this point I just want to know if i'm selected or not so I have the time to apply in other colleges as well. so far I only have a receipt of the payment which says \"provisionally confirmed\". if there is anybody else just like me waiting for them to get confirm or is accepted please let me know, atleast that gotta ease me up a little. thank you :))",
