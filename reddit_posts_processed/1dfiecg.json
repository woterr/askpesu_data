This is the only solution for stupid fuckers killing themselves."

Will bring my camera and capture the specimen in a few months.\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ Can't wait :))\nâ”‚           â””â”€â”€ On the bright side, you can finally see your friends where they truly belong - the snakes den /s\nâ””â”€â”€ Some of us animals are still struggling with this exhibit called ESA, you can come witness the magic if you wish to\n    â”œâ”€â”€ I seen them when cage was being made, I think they (cage building fellas) had some contract do before ESA results come. They were chilling on their laptop.\n    â””â”€â”€ Will put in leave at work just for this. Which exhibit will I find you in? Bird cage in MRD or the aquatic exhibit near the lake\n        â””â”€â”€ 8.30 - 11.30, Mech block, animal torture exhibit, aka the exam halls. That place is literally a mental torture facility at this point given how bad my ESAs have gone. \nAfter that, the MRD Bird Cage is my preferred choice of... Uhh, cage ? \n\nPS: You've heard of Pick Your Poison. Now get ready for Pick Your Prison. Proudly brought to you by PES EC."

There was already close to 0 campus life, now its a jail. Like what ????\n\nStupid ppl in management.\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ Is the situation the same now, are these grills removed? Got allotted ec campus cse in mock, what should I do?\nâ”‚           â””â”€â”€ Try for RR Campus, BMS CSE, MSRIT CSE   \nDon't think RV CE is even a question rn. \n\nif you don't get any of those clgs then PES EC isn't terrible either, sure the grills would suck but atleast you prolly won't be unemployed with choices like Dyanand sagar etc. \n\nAnyways there was never that much of \"college life\" to begin with and lots of times we just go out of campus to spend time. \n\nMoreover I think decent amount of people will forget about the grills in time but ya its certainly not better than not having grills\nâ””â”€â”€ PESU's hold on the mainstream media is insane. Good luck to the clueless future juniors :')"
