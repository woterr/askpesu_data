Else, PES.\n└── Yes the curriculum is almost similar except a few changes in each year\n    └── Mind sharing what these differences are?"

Overall maintaining your GPA isn't a easy task.\n\nAdvanced level evaluation and stuff is scam.. results are scam most of the time here. Evaluators know your name and other details, if you are really close to the faculty, higher chances u have of getting a much better grade. \n\nFaculty sucks.. no matter what you say most faculties in many engineering colleges suck.. they barely have knowledge in what they are working on. Take feedback from students before deciding a certain department or college.\n│       └── I'll consider all this, thanks!\n└── \"this college\" refers to rv or pes?\n    └── Pes obviously but in this college you won't be in your comfort zone which is a good point for me in my opinion"
