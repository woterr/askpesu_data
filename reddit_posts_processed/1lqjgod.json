She only said She's from PES University and asked if I am available to come to college on 4th for the above mentioned matter. \n\nAre all the students receiving the call or only a selected few?",

Do i need to wear ethnic formals or western formals? Since u got the call i believe u r wearing smtg tooo\n                └── They mentioned only formals. They didn't specify which. Why don't you wear western formal and also carry an ethnic wear? You can always keep ur bag aside while they take pics/ videos. \nOr just take the risk n wear western formals.\n                    └── Sent u a dm check it out pls"
