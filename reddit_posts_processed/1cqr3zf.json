Besides, I don't think you need the actual admit card since you will get your rank card once results are out.\n├── nah it does say you have to keep it till admissions complete since it has the signature of the invigilator.\n└── In the admit card it is mentioned that you need one signed by the invigilator, for further counseling\n    ├── Call admissions, they'll help you out.\n    └── bro don't worry just take a printout of admit card and go , if you still are not satisfied call office people and confirm what to do"
