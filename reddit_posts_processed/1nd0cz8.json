It's hardly a fair comparison if you include it. Its like saying r/bangalore is also r/PESU.\n    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Tbh the manipal town is almost nothing if u exclude manipal college.\n    â””â”€â”€ How is pesu sub not active, there is a post like every hour.\nPretty much everyone comes here to get their kcet doubts answered too.\nI think u keep looking at srm posts so u get more of those."
