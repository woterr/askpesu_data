  "content": "Since many were asking how was PESSAT, I'll put the details here\n\nEnglish - 10 MCQs Comprehension + 10 MCQs for Antonyms and Synonyms\n\nMaths\n - Integration, Relations, Functions & Sets had more weightage than other chapters\n - it was moderate paper, 10-15 difficult questions, 20-25 Easy, 20-25 Intermediate Questions were asked - there were also Integer Type Questions (Around 10 i believe I don't remember that properly)\n\nPhysics\n- Magnetism, NLM, Motions (1D, 2D, Rotational, Circular) and Modern Physics had more weightage than other chapters\n - My preparation for Physics was bad, so I can't comment on the difficulty - it also had 1-2 questions which wasn't there for PU Board namely Radioactivity\n\nChemistry\n- I don't remember much about it (but I'll update asking my other friends who were also writing in the same slot\n\nThis is only based on April 20, Slot 1 - the weightage and difficulty may or may not vary for other dates and slots",
