Hostel and pg have their own pros and cons. \nHostel pros:\n- A lot of friends\n- You can make a lot of memories\nHostel cons: \n- No freedom. They have a lot of rules and time restrictions\n- Food can be an issue sometimes.\nPg pros:\n- More freedom. Not a lot of rules and curfew time is usually 10 for girls and I think it's either same for guys and few pgs are such that guys go whenever they want to.\nPg cons: \n- Don't think you can do as much masti as in hostel\n3. I've seen people staying in the library till 9pm.\n4. Not really ig.\n5. They do provide food. But if you are opting for room/flat, there are a few eateries around, like BS home food."
