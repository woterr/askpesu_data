The rest 60%'s split between JEE Mains, KCET (through PES counselling; this is what you see on the website) and management.\n└── But the fees through KCET counselling and kcet through pes counselling will be the same ?\n    ├── Nah 5 lakhs through pes councelling \n    └── Through PES its 5 lakhs so cutoff rank will be less other wise its 1.2l thru KEA counselling"
