I get the point of fun, but it shouldn't be to that extent where people are going out of ways getting involved in this, just for the sake of temporary \"who knows for what\" happiness .\n└── You must be fun at parties\n    └── Don't get me wrong, my objection was only for \"repost this in fellow colleges subreddit\". But yeah u r free to do whatever u want. I was just trying to convey my take which can be entirely/somewhat wrong.\n\nAt last have no doubts, I am damn fun at parties (never been to one)"

But come on guys you could do better than this tbh.\n└── Umm dude, you do realise that a lot of people who have jobs are being part of this right!\n\nLike, once you start working, you can still be involved in silly things!!!\n\nHave fun in your life dude"
