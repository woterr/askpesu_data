Do you think CSE in RR is possible? I’m off by almost 200 from their second closing rank. EC campus is like my only safety net for CSE at this point looking at the result of my other entrances.\n    └── CSE in RR is possible but I guess it’s going to be very luck dependent because of the borderline rank however ranks do fluctuate and 200 isn’t that far off. I can’t say I’m sure but if luck favours you it’s a very good chance you can get RR.\n        └── im 10xx can the rank cutoff be higher than that?"
