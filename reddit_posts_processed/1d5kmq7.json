It's totally dependent on the performance of the overall batch. \nBut for our batch we had mildly relative grading for physics and Math-2. Mechanical and Electrical are fairly scoring in the ESAs so absolute.\nIf the ESA papers are very tough there is a higher chance of relative grading, you can judge it for yourself"
