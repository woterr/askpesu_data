      "body": "For the first 2 sems, you'll need to be in the top 5% of your cycle (physics/chem). 3rd sem onwards, you'll need to be in the top 5% of your course/department.\n\n  \nYou'll need a Union Bank account to get the scholarships, but you'll only need to worry about that after the first sem exams.\n\n  \nDifficulty of getting the scholarships depends on the amount of effort you put in, there's no way to generally say if it's easy or hard.\n└── Is it based on semesters or year??\n\n I mean for the 1st year there are 2 sems so if someone is in the top 5% they will get the scholarship and again for the 2nd semester top 5% doesn't that mean they completely recovered the tuition fee???\n    └── You get 50% of the semester fees as scholarship. So if you're in the top 5% in both sems, you'll get back half your annual fees.\n        └── Oh ok i calculated it wrong??\n            └── Let's say you pay 5L for first year, and you get scholarship in 1st sem (5%) one, you will get 1.25L in your bank account, if you get again in 2nd sem, you'll get 1.25L more, totally making your scholarship amount 2.5L, half of what you paid for 1st year"
