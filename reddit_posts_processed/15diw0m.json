      "body": "everything gets rounded up generally, cgpa, final marks etc etc\n├── Ok, thanks!\n├── By how much, like if someone gets 7.97, is it rounded off to 8 ?\n└── False info\n    └── back up your claim?\n        └── Going through placements now, nothing is rounded off, especially GPA. A company rejected students with less than 85% in 10th grade. I saw a student with 84.8% highlighted and rejected.\n            └── The question and my answer were both about university marking, not about external companies. On your marks cards the gpa mentioned is definitely rounded up by 2 decimal places. Same thing happens with final ISA marks as well.\n                └── OP has specifically asked if the two decimal places are considered. Answer is yes. No where is it rounded off. \n\nExample: 8.88 is NOT rounded off to 9. Be it on the PESU portal, marks card or placement sheet."

Don’t believe the false comments. \n\nI myself got 7.98 GPA in a sem which set me back and because of that I won’t be able to apply for certain companies during placements (currently experiencing it)\n└── But 3 decimals gets rounded up right?Say if one has 7.9995 it gets rounded upto 8 right?Sure 7.99 wont get rounded up to 8\n    └── As far as I know, it doesn’t work that way. Because I’ve seen a case where the 7.995 remained as 7.99. \n\nI’m not sure what may happen with a 7.999 case. Hopefully you get the upgrade. Atb!"
