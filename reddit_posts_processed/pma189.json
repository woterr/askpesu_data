You can find cutoffs for previous years in the archives of the KEA website.\n└── And whats the cutoff through jee mains?\n    └── I don't think they take admissions through JEE Mains. AFAIK, it's only through KCET, PESSAT and management quota. No COMEDK as well.\n        └── In their seat matrix they had provided the no. of seats for jee mains quota as well\n            ├── Well then I might be wrong. When I took admission in 2019, KCET, PESSAT and management quota were the only options. I'm afraid I might not be able to help you with that.\n            └── the JEE mains quota is over. I got EEE with a percentile of 96"
