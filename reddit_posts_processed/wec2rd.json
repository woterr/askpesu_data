I've started doing CP on codechef already with all the knowledge I have in CPP and Python. Participated in their contest today and did fairly decent in accordance to my level. Next I'll do DSA after learning pointers and stuff. Thanks for your advice though, my brother's case is similar to yours!\n            â””â”€â”€ I started in 4th sem and continue todo even now though I have got placed.\n\nATB!\n                â””â”€â”€ Yea thanks for helping out. I've started my DSA prep too.\nI have a follow up question, the DSA they teach in uni will be the same or different? Like did they teach all the topics of DSA or basics only.\n                    â””â”€â”€ In 3rd sem, they teach Data structures completely but NOT algorithms.\n\nIn 4th sem, they teach all algos like DP,greedy, divide and conquer,sorting, graphs etc.\n\nThis serves as a wafer thin foundation but you have to solve(mediums and hard)  leetcode topic wise(lc has filters for each topic) to get grip over the topics taught.\n                        â””â”€â”€ So if they're already teaching DSA topics and considering I'll be practicing questions on leetcode from the topics taught too, how will that be different from doing a course in the first year itself+practicing."
