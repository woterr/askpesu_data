There is no point of absolute grading when everybody is shitting their exams.\n    ├── Waw fr?\n    ├── Ohh then its impossible there will be some legend who will ace todays test\n    ├── That's not happening, I know one person who we definitely score above 95\n    └── bruh who told u this, when math had reletive last year ppl did cross 95. Reletive grading happens when a lot of people fail.\n        └── 95 overall? As in esa+issa? \nNo chance. Btw I am a 3rd year student.  We had a subject called software engineering in 5th sem which was the easiest subject till date in this college. People got A grade for 71 marks including me. Adding to this only 5 ppl failed in this subject.\n            └── But is there a rule like that? A rule that if anyone gets 95+ no relative grading, that sound so random.\n                └── In the meet Jawahar told that 95 is the threshold and is nobody scores 95 the difference between the guy's marks and 95 will be added to everybody.\n                    └── jawu is full of shit if i am not wrong."
