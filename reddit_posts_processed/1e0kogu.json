I am not so sure about this point because a typical fresher like me won't understand these buzz words, still why PES would make a curriculum which would miss out some of the fundamentals, I suppose this course would be structured on the basis of years discussions, tests, and other projects isn't it, even AICTE approves it .......  \n\n\n3. I am targeting for master's in abroad (particularly USA), and this point is the one which is making me regret about my decisions of taking CSE (AI-ML) over CSE.  \n  \n Can you brief this point more ?  \n And how can I deal with this problem if I had to do my master's abroad ?\n\n4.

What do you think will the placement stats be for CSE(AI-ML) according to you or any other fellas there in this branch ?\n\n2. Why do cutoffs for CSE (AI-ML) for RR usually go high compared to CSE at EC, are those people less aware or brain washed ?\n\n3.

      "body": "There are hardly any openings for freshers in ML roles. \n\nCutoffs are higher because deep down everyone ignorantly has some sort of perception that RR campus is the \"main\" campus and you are missing out on something if you come to EC campus\n\nMy own brother wrote Kcet this year and was in the exact same situation as you he was getting rr aiml and ec campus cse , I guided him to take Ec campus cse, Aiml is a very math heavy, you won't have any idea as a fresher what ur getting your self into. I wanted my brother to have the liberty to pick which ever domain he wants to get into after exploring it first as the course progresses , He will have the choice to get into cybersecurity or systems or Aiml later on when he reaches 3rd year or a mix of any these subjects based on his interests. Unlike my brother you will be forced down your throat with Aiml whether you like it or not. \n\n  \nfrom what I've read the profs don't like specialization in uh cuz they skip the fundamentals which impacts admits in mscs programs\n└── Referring to your last statement.. The professors from where don’t like specialisations in UG? USA?\n    ├── Yup USA\n    │   └── Thanks, just replied as you commented lol.\n    └── Admission committees abroad (which comprises of profs). The general idea is that UG is for fundamentals and MS is for specialisation. A specialisation degree like CS-AIML makes no sense in undergrad when you haven't even covered the fundamentals in CS. That is why I did not even submit the MIDS (Machine Intelligence and Data Science) specialisation certificate during my MS applications, even though I took up ML related courses as electives and cleared the specialisation requirement. Note that pursuing these courses as electives is ok, but it is not ok when they replace core parts of your CS degree.\n        └── it really does not replace things you need though\n\nin third sem ddco and mpca is combined into one. some parts of the syllabus from both is deleted, but it's not a lot. either way, this is a subject nobody cares about. if you ask any related questions a year later, i think a cs and an aiml student would give a similar high level answer.\n\nin 4th sem LA is replaced by math for machine learning. again, it has everything LA has except for a few stuff. but it includes a lot more.\n\nin 5th sem, the ML course is replaced by something similar but again, a bit more.\n\nthe only huge difference is in 6th sem, where OOP is replaced by some Deep learning course. this is the only course which aiml people will miss and have something completely different. \n\nas for electives, the ML related electives by the aiml department are alright. and you can also choose any of the cybersecurity electives from cs. most people take either of these anyways, so it's mostly similar here too.\n\n  \nthe only thing that cs people have over aiml is the OOP course and a couple more elective choices. \n\nit's really not as bad as you make it out to be. i actually liked that they rushed through the boring theory subjects like MPCA and that we could learn big data as a core course\n            ├── >either way, this is a subject nobody cares about.\n\nYeah see that is the problem. (1)You are assuming nobody cares about it - not everyone is interested in AIML. Whether you care about it or not is a different matter. (2) What matters is if it is deemed sufficient from a Masters admission requirement point of view. You would probably be surprised to know that a lot of MSCS programs have mandatory courses which are advanced level graduate versions of undergrad courses, and some of them do have courses like OS and architecture. How will you justify it being a good reason to be skipped then? Its not for you to decide whether a certain part of the syllabus is not needed (and neither am I the one deciding).\n\nLA, ML etc weren't an issue any day so not going to address them.\n\n>the only huge difference is in 6th sem, where OOP is replaced by some Deep learning course\n\nAnd do you think this is a sensible decision for a \"CS\" degree?\n\nAgain for electives, my problem wasn't with that, so not addressing it.\n\n>i actually liked that they rushed through the boring theory subjects like MPCA and that we could learn big data as a core course\n\nUnderstandable if you are looking for a specialised degree but not justifiable from a \"fundamental CS degree\" point of view. And repeating what I said earlier - not everyone cares about AIML. Whether you think it is boring is not at all relevant.\n            └── Hey can u just give the subjects for 5th and 6th sem AIML"

Remind me after 8 pm if I don't respond.\n├── >Why are premier institutes like IITs and BITS Pilani (MnC only) introducing so many specialisations be it data science, AI-ML, or MnC ?\n\nPretty much the same reason as T2/3 colleges - to increase student intake. There is no other reason. If you think of colleges as anything apart from businesses then you are deluded.\n\n>I am not so sure about this point because a typical fresher like me won't understand these buzz words, still why PES would make a curriculum which would miss out some of the fundamentals, I suppose this course would be structured on the basis of years discussions, tests, and other projects isn't it, even AICTE approves it .......\n\nThere are a fixed number of courses you can have per semester. The only way to fit in AIML related stuff is by replacing some of these courses. Note that none of us would have had an issue if they *added* content, not replaced. You are forgetting that PES (and other autonomous colleges )has power over its syllabus and they can structure it as per their need. For example, the syllabus at Manipal replaces compiler design and automata while keeping in computer architecture while PES has made a mess out of architecture and we do not know what has happened to the compiler course (syllabus isn't out yet). It is not based on \"years\" of discussions - the first AIML batch is yet to enter 3rd year and the syllabus for it is still not out.\n\n>I am targeting for master's in abroad (particularly USA), and this point is the one which is making me regret about my decisions of taking CSE (AI-ML) over CSE.\n\n>I'm someone who went through the MS application process, have friends who went through it and in touch with faculty and industry folks who know about it too. Specialised degrees are not recognised too well because of the simple fact that undergrad is meant for fundamentals (something I stressed about in my last comment as well). Does that mean your doors are closed? Nope. But it honestly does not make you look good. More than that, it will cause issues if you do not have minimum admission course requirements as explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/1d66gzl/comment/l6v07vi/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). As for how to deal with this problem - if you do not have the courses there is simply nothing that can be done.\n\n>Ain't your 3rd and 5th point contradicting each other \n\nNot sure how. I am explaining that the field itself is a high knowledge requiring field, which means you need at least a MS or PhD for actual ML roles in the industry. More details [in this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/1drdt4h/comment/lauveid/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). While on the other hand to pursue a specialised MS in AI or even CS, you will need to ensure that you meet the basic requirements set. These points are not related. I am not saying you do not need an MS or anything else.\n│   └── >What are the electives for CSE (AI-ML) students ?\n\nYou can find it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/1dz8fo9/what_to_expect_from_these_courses/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Additional thing to note - I know a lot of AIML students not picking from the courses here but rather picking electives from core CS. Second note - many of these courses are rebranded versions of existing core CS electives (social networking is graph theory, info retrieval is AIWIR, etc) which CS kids will take up. Being in core CS, you can also pick electives from any branch, including AIML, upon department approval.\n\n>What do you think will the placement stats be for CSE(AI-ML) according to you or any other fellas there in this branch ?\n\nExactly same or similar to core CS since there aren't really ML jobs for freshers - all of them will sit for the same companies that visit for core CS. The actual way to measure a difference is to see how many from the AIML branch secure AIML jobs. If they end up securing SWE roles then it is effectively useless in comparison. If PES does actually filter and see how many get actual ML roles, you will notice at best, not more than a fraction of what is advertised. Hence, as I said, pick it only if you care about having similar placements.\n\n>Why do cutoffs for CSE (AI-ML) for RR usually go high compared to CSE at EC, are those people less aware or brain washed ?\n\nTwo reasons - (1) Some people still think RR is better than EC and do not know that they are equivalent. There used to be a difference only until 2018 incoming batch, but most websites and blogs are outdated. This is more about people being unaware of changes. (2) People are going by hype, just like you. \n\n>If I want to change my college from RR to EC how to do it, is it possible to change my branch from RR itself, from CSE (AI-ML) to CSE ?\n\nYou can do it during second round of counseling as long as there are available seats in EC CS. Or the next time to do it is during branch change after 1st year, based on CGPA.\n│       └── u/Interstellar777077\n\nI've addressed everything in this thread.
