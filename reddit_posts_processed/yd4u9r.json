We have inter department and inter college matches all the time so you can look forward for that too.\n└── ahh ok thanks buddy, so the only reason to join this college is pooled placement with rr branch, any other point to be noted?\n    └── Kinda yes. We've got a good crowd too. Decent activities and rather chilled out campus."
