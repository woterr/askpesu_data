Won't the best crowd come there for cse.. Don't they study there?\nâ”‚           â””â”€â”€ depends from person to person. I know a person who got into IIT Guwahati but passed out a year or 2 later than his batchmates, some. people dont study that much after getting into college, drugs also play a role.. many things tbh. Just cause you score a good rank anoll doesnt mean youll do extremely well in college\nâ”‚               â””â”€â”€ >know a person who got into IIT Guwahati but passed out a year or 2 later than his batchmates\n\nAyo, can u elaborate? \n\n>Just cause you score a good rank anoll doesnt mean youll do extremely well in college\n\nðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ I'm scared..\nâ”‚                   â””â”€â”€ well, he got into weed and other drugs. He didnt have a good friend group basically, all that shit caused him to fall behind.\n\nDw bro, just work hard in college. I dont have much knowledge abt this but afaik, youll learn as you progress in college\nâ”‚                       â””â”€â”€ Ahh, tqsm man..\nâ””â”€â”€ XD, I mean is the course structured in that way, or the crowd isn't really interested in doing it ?"
