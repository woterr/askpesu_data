So it's mostly the same thing with extra stuff\n│       └── like will it be an issue if I go for masters?\n│           └── Ultimately, the best choice depends on your long-term goals and interests. If you're certain about pursuing a career or further studies in AI/ML, the CSE (AIML) specialization could be beneficial. However, if you prefer to keep your options open or are interested in exploring various fields within computer science, a Core CSE degree might be a better fit.\n\n\n\nSome Master's programs may prefer or require a broader background in computer science, which a Core CSE degree might better provide.\n\n\n\nBut then specialized programs in AI/ML may find your CSE (AIML) background particularly appealing as well. \n\nI'm not too sure about MTech prerequisites cuz I'm joining PES this year too and idrk ,  but I  hope the above makes sense\n│               └── yes thank you\n└── Thank you so much. Is there a generic PESU drive where they store this. Somehow I could not find this in PESU academy.
