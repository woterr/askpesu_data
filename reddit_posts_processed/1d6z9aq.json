You've to write a letter to your summer courses coordinator mentioning the course and slot you'd like to enroll for.\n└── do I have to pay for the credits too ?\n    ├── According to recent credit distribution, you have to earn 6 credits through special topic courses taken either during regular semesters or summer. You do not have to pay to complete those 6 credits. You have to pay if you are doing course beyond 6 credits. They charge Rs.2500/- per credit\n    │   └── appreciate the help\n    └── Its 2.5k per credit."
