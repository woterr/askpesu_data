Try other colleges if you badly want ECE. \n\nPES Is known for CSE and CSE-AIML.

      "body": "If you are truly interested in ECE, it's decent in PES.\n It's gonna be academically intensive but if you're up for a good challenge, yes it's good. \nThe ECE syllabus in PES is infact better than colleges under VTU.\n└── while I am interested in ece, I keep hearing how there are little to no internships and that ece students have to sit for IT companies for placements too, I am worried that even after learning electronics, if I end up in somewhere like tcs what would be the point\n    └── Yes that kinda is the sad reality but if you're really interested in the subject, i don't think you'd want to worry much about placements, getting an ece core job is very difficult indeed but you'll get there eventually. \nOne key tip: Don't ever compare yourself to your CSE peers. \nCareer graph for an ECE major who sticks to core electronics is a gradual one, so don't be in a rush"
