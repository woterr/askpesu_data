      "body": "PES - for anyone who has plan to pursue masters, doing Btech in same branch will make a big difference\n└── Does aiml in pes count as same branch as cs\n    └── yes and no - 90+% sylabus overlap is there, so yes. However there are some universities especially in Europe which are particular about CSE and don't accept AIML as same.\n        └── Even if coursework is same ? Pes has literally 100% same syllabus except electives. Also how many unis we talking abt? Anything that will make a significant difference in the future ? I gotta pick between rr aiml and ec cs. Rr has a shorter travel time for me\n            ├── I would say weigh your options independent of MS eligibility and decide (as that is not so big a concern to choose between CS and CS AIML). \n\nBTW, what is your KCET rank, if you are ok to share? Did you give PESSAT as well?\n            └── The syllabus is exactly the same.Timings are far better in rr and overall flexibility and crowd is too."
