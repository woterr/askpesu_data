Is it 40/100 in esa or 40/100 overall\n│   └── Overall\n└── its less than 40 if relatively graded\n    └── Don't assume relative by default.\n        └── Yeah thats my problem cause i dont understand how can anyone get 10 in a course if its absolute.. even if someone gets 35 in both isas, 90 in esa, 10 in assignment he barely manages to get 10.\n            └── I've gotten, and so have many others. And there will be many in your batch who get it too. 90+ is S grade or 10 GP. You effectively need to maximise marks in everything as you said, leaving room for error only in ISA/ESA. It's difficult but definitely possible. It's all about how well you've prepared for the course."
