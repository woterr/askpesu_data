  "content": "TLDR; I got PES ECE seat through 1st round of counseling which happened on 17th June. Is it worth surrendering this seat(I have time till 12th July to take a call) for RV/MSRIT in the 3rd round of COMEDK counseling\n\nP.S: I am not concerned about placemnets. Ofc ik that RV is better than PES in terms of placements\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy rank in PESSAT was 16XX and I got in PES RR campus ECE. Before 12th July I have the chance to surrender this seat but by then I won't be able to get any college either from CET or COMEDK. My COMEDK rank is 38XX. According to last years cut off I can get RVCE in third round of COMEDK counselling which will happen maybe in August. By then PES second round counselling would also hsve been completed. They are planning to start from Aug 7/14. My question: Is it a good idea to leave this PES seat and wait for which college i get in third round of COMEDK counselling(RV or MSRIT or some other)?",

If that is true u might have chance to get rvce b4 pes 2nd round but ull end up with a penalty to surrender.\n└── I don't think so because the first round counselling schedule says that the seat allotment of first round will happen on 18th July\n    └── Oh I see.. well rv is the better choice but ya u need to be sure u will get it ig. Good Luck ! Hope you get what u choose :)"

I was pretty happy with my 1.7k in COMEDK\n            └── You prolly got a good rank in pessat no so its fine"
