We have to wait till the counseling happens, that would be around 4-July. But the fees for this category will be 5L 😂\n        ├── oh you were talking about the kcet seats. thank god, cus i thought the jee seats were not confirmed 😭 i got cse aiml in rr thru jee counselling so i was worried i might lose my seat\n        └── Oh is it 5L through pesu kcet counselling too i thought its only for mains it will be somewhat lesser. Anyways can u tell how u got to know did u ask in campus?\n            └── Yes it’s 5L fees for this (PESU KCET). Actual KCET counseling is yet to be announced in that fees should be around 1L.\n                └── Thanks"

The 45% jee mains/kcet quota uses the pes ranks for seats. I heard the kcet quota in that 45% is very low but not sure about the details.\n    ├── Its 15% management\n45% jee \n40%kcet\nDw worry and dont make others worry\n    └── I think op is gonna join through kea itself not state reservation in jee main quota\n        └── I believe 2.3k pes rank is around 15k rank in kcet so it's impossible to get pes through kea. And if you go as per the 45% jee mains/kcet quota there are no reservations there.Let's hope there are more seats in jee mains/kcet quota for the op"
