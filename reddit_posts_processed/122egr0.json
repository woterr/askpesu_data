      "body": "As u/rowlet-owl pointed out, you must be referring to the 2 credit special topics. They are a double edged sword because unless you score well in them, they will bring down your gpa. And yes, as far as i know you can take up special topics from other departments. You can speak with your faculty advisor regarding the same and they will direct you. There's no way to know which one is easier. That will depend on your interest and capabilities."
