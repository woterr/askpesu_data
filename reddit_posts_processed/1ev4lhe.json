Thank you\n            â””â”€â”€ It is applicable when you are a government employee ward\n                â””â”€â”€ why so many downvotes ðŸ’€\n                    â””â”€â”€ ðŸ˜‚ these people from karnataka are just as always being rude to North indians just ignore them"

If it is CSE or IS or ECE its mostly north indians or malayalis or Gujaratis. If it is mechanical or civil or mechanical or aerospace then its mostly Kannadigas.\n    â””â”€â”€ whole thread is getting downvotes for some reason ðŸ’€"

I'm pretty sure you'll find enough North Indian people in the campus. Make friends with south indian people too :))\nâ””â”€â”€ I sure will! I was just concerned about the language barriers bro\n    â””â”€â”€ Bro just say \"kannada gothilla\" It means I don't know kannada and they will start communicating in English\n        â”œâ”€â”€ Okay! Thanks\n        â””â”€â”€ No offense.. But a slight change in the way u approach would be greatly appreciated.. Instead of saying 'kannada gotilla which implies u don't know the lang.. U can say ' kannada kalitha idini' instead which means ur learning the language.. Those small efforts would make a whole lot of difference.. \nNonetheless, be chill, just like others hv already told, majority of us, would be welcoming and embrace u n ur lang, culture, just like hw bengaluru has always been\n            â””â”€â”€ Thanks for helping ðŸ™ƒ"
