      "body": "Most notes get outdated pretty quickly here because PESU updates the syllabus a little every year. So after 3-4 years, the syllabus becomes extremely different and it isn't advisable to use them anymore. \n\nThus as someone commented - make your own notes or find someone in your batch or immediate seniors who writes."
