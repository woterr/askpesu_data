I want CSE or specialisation in RR campus. Is there any seats left for round 2? (My HS is Delhi btw)\n    └── try for cse first in rr or ecc, i would say apply, why not?\n        └── Brother will get because there is no past year cutoffs based on jm. Still I will surely do. \nI wanted to know that placement % is 85% so it is like they allow every student (around 1400) to sit or like other clg they eliminate by cgpa and attendance criteria and allow only 1/2 or 2/3 of the batch size?\n\nP.S-Don't mind me asking because in Delhi all these top Pvt clg hype there placement and I don't know the condition of BLR.PES will be costly for me (around 25-27L) so I'm little concerned.\n            └── PES cse placements are very good tbh, the gpa cutoff is 6.75 ( 90% cross it, its very easy to cross this tbh) so most of the batch does sit for placements.   \nThe JEE quota is pure merit ( 50% seats i think), KCET quota is government control so it has reservation."
