  "content": "Iâ€™ve been feeling unmotivated and uninterested in things I used to enjoy. Even on breaks, I donâ€™t feel rested. I wake up feeling like I should be productive but end up doing nothing and feeling guilty. Activities like video editing, anime, or even things that used to excite me donâ€™t feel the same. Even when I try something refreshing, like going for a walk, the feeling doesnâ€™t last. I donâ€™t know if this is burnout or something else, but I want to understand why I feel this way and what I can do about it.\n\n\nI also feel the last time I was completely free (without any actual tensions) was in my 9th.\nI constantly long for holidays but end up doing nothing , and feel sad for going to clg the next Monday.\nHow do resolve this problem asap, I wanna do quite some thing and if it's my  current self then I definitely can't do those \"things\"",

As you watch animes I think you join their respective sub reddits and have a discussion about the anime you prefer during your free time \n\nFinally try dancing  to some desi songs while you are bathing I think it might help you feel motivated ðŸ˜º \n\nAnyway stay motivated and be happy that atleast you are not indulged in some wrong activities\nâ”œâ”€â”€ \"Dancing to desi songs\" so cute ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ yeah dancing to soni de nakhre reallyyy helps bruv trust me on this one\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ Will try tmrw for sureðŸ¥°\nâ””â”€â”€ Dancing or vibing is an instant cure, trust me... I do it regularly. Be careful if u r doing it in bathroom.. ðŸ˜…"

I struggle with a lack of confidence, overthinking simple things, and experiencing a lot of stress due to confusion .like If I take an exam, I keep thinking afterwardâ€”Did I choose the correct answers? Did I fill out the OMR sheet correctly? These thoughts keep looping in my mind, and I still havenâ€™t found a way to stop them. (I feel like this will stay with me for life.)\n\n(Even i am in 4th sem) \n\nNote: My grammar is bad, so I corrected it using gpt.\nâ””â”€â”€ Lmao"
