  "content": "Hi, I have a question for the freshers in the B.tech program(CSE). How are classes going on, and how much are you guys enjoying it, and the campus environment? \n\nIs it good, are you feeling a bit overwhelmed? How's the college life since PESU is committing to a 3 ISA system? Is it a bit lenient or is it as strict as before? \n\nI wish some seniors would comment on it, and share their experiences and opinions on their college life, so that the freshers may get an idea on how they will be spending 4 years in EC Campus. \n\nThank you.",

Attendance is fking me up.\n├── Could you elaborate on how the examination system works? I am finding it a bit hard to understand it since most posts about PES are more than a year old.\n│   └── There are 2 In-Semester Assessments(ISA) and 1 End Semester Assessment (ESA) for each semester\nISA's are for 40 marks each which will be converted to 20\nESA'S are for 100 marks which will be converted to 50\nAnd then some kind of assignments which carries 10 marks\nSo totally , ISA1(20) + ISA2(20) + ESA(50) + Assignment(10) = 100\nWhich ig is converted into cgpa on a 10 point scale\n│       ├── So u do stay awake during classes\n│       └── So would you say this is creates a more lenient environment for one to take up extracurricular activities and hobbies compared to the earlier system, considering less number of exams are being conducted?\n│           └── Maybe , but you'll still be busy... also I've heard it gets harder as the years progress.\n└── >Overall, I feel great and don't regret joining pes.\n\nWait till you come to 2nd year 😂💀👍🏻\n    └── Wait bro wdym ? Same campus same level of torture what could be worse ?\n        └── Breh every thing \nIt's kinda overwhelming in 3rd semester\nSome courses are poorly designed (eg web tech ) .\nAnd the pressure is just too much in 3rd sem .\nSo enjoy while you can in 1st year\n            ├── Damn 😩\n            └── True.. Specially for DDCO! It's course material and what they're asking in ISA is very different.\n                └── personally , none of the courses are half as overwhelming as web tech ,  its just messed up\n                    └── Web Tech's syllabus for ISA 1 was fu\\*king enormous man.."
