      "body": "* Almost all reviews you'll find online are outdated because the EC campus became autonomous only in 2018. The first batch that graduated was in 2022, before that it was under VTU and was to be completely honest, very poor. However, the last almost 5 years have seen a drastic change in EC campus making both campuses nearly identical now (and I say this as an RR campus kid, so no bias here). \n\n* Head to the PESU FAQs: https://bit.ly/pesu-faq. You'll find that one of the questions is a comparison between RR and EC campus. I believe that should answer all your queries regarding EC campus for CSE.\n└── Thank you so much <3"
