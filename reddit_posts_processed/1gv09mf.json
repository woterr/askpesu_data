      "body": "HP is S tier. Fairly easy to get A(like half got A or S). Very good and updated syllabus and content(maybe the best in PESU CS). The assignments are world class(not joking, it’s the kinda useful assignments you see in foreign unis. The load is heavy but it will actually teach you something that helps your career). Overall if you’re even remotely interested in a career in systems or related then 100% take this. Worth checking out even if not because some concepts are universal for a software engineer.\n└── Are there any computational requirements(like GPUs )for HP?  \nfor assignment/projects?\n    └── No, there was a CUDA assignment but you can use google colab for that. I used colab."

Twin and Extended reality is also very surface level and quite easy from what I heard.\n\nElective 4- Database Technologies is considered easy."
