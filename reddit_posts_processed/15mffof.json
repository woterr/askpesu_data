You cannot expect a laptop with a Nvidia graphics card\n\nDell and HP aren't recommended because they don't have that competitive specifications comapred to lenovo or asus and even if they do the price is very expensive\n└── Bro I wanted to know whether a Mac would suffice for the coding we do in clg ?\n    └── I don't know.
