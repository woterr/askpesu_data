Till this year, only 5 percent of seats were reserved for jee mains quota, from next year 35 percent of seats will be filled thru jee mains..

      "body": "I secured 97.51%tile in JEE Mains 2024 in the April Attempt. I applied in PES through JEE Mains quota and was offered all the courses in RR and EC campus except for CSE and AIML. So I would say 98%tile+ would be the cutoff for CSE. I took up B.Tech ECE in RR campus. I wish they had scrapped PESSAT right from 2024. I would have benefited from that. Now since that there is not PESSAT and only JEE Mains, KCET and Mgmt, the cutoff would probably decrease for all branches including CSE. So anywhere above 96-97 would put you on a safer side. For CSE try to keep atleast above 97.5%tile.\n├── Whats the fee for you?\nIs it similar to the pessat kids \n│   └── The fees is the same as that of PESSAT. Paid 4.3Lakh per year for ECE. It varies with branches. For mech it’s about 3.9Lakh. For CSE it’s 4.9Lakh.\n│       └── Should have gone to thapar cs dude...\nPes ece ain't worth the fees you're paying\n│           └── what was the cutoff for ec campus CS?\n│               └── Idk man.\n\nBut closed at 98.5\n│                   └── ohh rr and ec campus cs had same cutoff percentile for jee this yr?\n│                       └── Respective cutoffs aren't released..\n└── what was the cutoff for ec campus CS?"
