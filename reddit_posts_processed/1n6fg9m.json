  "content": "So just got in ECE and in 1st year and I'm a type of guy who doesn't much like to sit in class I prefer studying alone or learn skills but 75% attendance I will try to keep it 75 but i just want to know is there gonna be fine or meet someone like HOD if it's not 75 and I assume they won't let u sit in exams so what would be the process if in case and they told you cant lv the college in between without informing bcz i was thinking of bunking some class and sit in library.
