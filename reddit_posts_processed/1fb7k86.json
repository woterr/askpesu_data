Even those who score in the 99.96 percentile may not receive interview calls from the top IIMs.\n            └── Not all candidates. Plus if you get 99.96 you'll definitely get calls from IIM Calcutta. Also it your not an engineer and a bcom graduate like the op , you get diversity points. Also there are colleges like fms , sp jain , xlri ,which are at the top"
