If I don't attend ESA will it be considered a backlog and I would have to clear it ?\n\nAlso it is better to drop the course if it reduces my CGPA or is it worth keeping it for the credits?\n\nAnd if I get more credits than the required amount by 8th sem, can I then drop 1 or 2 credit courses where I got less grades?",
