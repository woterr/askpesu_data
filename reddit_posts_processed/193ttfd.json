  "content": "I'm a first sem chem cycle student and I have scored dismally low in a certain ISA 2 paper, although it was my best exam among all subjects. It looks like only my mcqs were autocorrected and my 4 markers weren't even looked at.  Is there any chance of error in paper correction? I would be aware if I fucked up the paper but that was not the case. I've also considered that I may have marked my SRN incorrectly or made a mistake while bubbling, but that seems improbable because I always cross check. I'm just reallly worried right now.",

Wherever there's room for errors, there's always a chance, however small, of some mistake during evaluation.\nâ””â”€â”€ I see. Some of my friends had their ISA 1 scores increased by a few marks, so im just hoping for the best."

I'm not entirely sure about it but an invigilator did mention it several times.\n    â””â”€â”€ Ohhhh Nothing like this was told to us :/  \nOn another note- what if the teacher looks at the page first, sees it as empty withut checking the typed part and proceeds to check the next question? ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…\n        â””â”€â”€ AFAIK each teacher is assigned to correct one particular answer across all students' papers, so I believe it's unlikely. Let's just wait for review and hope for the best in this hellhole of a college :')\n            â””â”€â”€ Haha yeah fair enough!  \ngl to your re-eval too"
