      "body": "usually T1 companies come in the first few months only. Most of the companies will come and go by December. Plus, the last 2 sems don't have many credits and at this point, it will barely affect your cgpa tbh\nâ””â”€â”€ So what's the gpa distribution like ? I always thought it's 25% of total for every year :/\n    â””â”€â”€ Nah, you'll have just 10 credits for last 2 sems excluding capstone. Most of the credits will be done by sem 6. You'll have 160 credits total. Do the math"

If you like take the companies details so that you'd at least have their info for reference.\n    â””â”€â”€ Probability of companies coming for placement in the last month's of 8th semester vit for 2025 batch?\n        â””â”€â”€ They come year round. You need to keep an eye out and apply once they do. You'll get added to the placement email...so you'd know"
