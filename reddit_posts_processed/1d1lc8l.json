During the summer after the third year, you can claim only 2 credits via summer internship and 4 credits via summer courses. Whatever remaining credit shortage you have needs to be covered using special topics spread across the 7th and 8th semesters.\n└── Can I do 5th sem's special topic during the holidays after second year?\n    └── You can take up summer courses, which will add the required credits."
