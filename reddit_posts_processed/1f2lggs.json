  "content": "Hi, Im joining pes university through management quota (cse), yes my father paid almost 48 lakhs for just a mere btech degree, but I promised him that I would return all the money after I start earning.\n\nI wanted to ask that will I be treated ill if I disclose in college that I am a mqt student or should I just lie. Also I got 91 percentile in jee mains, so would I be able to survive in this college ?",
