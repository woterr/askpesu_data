      "body": "Hey\n\nYes my friends told it is harder than KCET but easier than JEE Mains .\n\nI gave that EduGorilla mock test for pessat as it was the only one I could find. Can't talk about how relevant it was as I have not given PESSAT yet.\nâ””â”€â”€ thanks. do you know if there's any specific syllabus for it? it's not on their website\n    â”œâ”€â”€ Well they have mentioned that 11th and 12th CBSE syllabus is there on their site so im studying some 11th chapters and mostly 12th chapters\n    â””â”€â”€ I mailed them. Full syllabus 11th 12th. Best of luck"

There is no reason for them to conduct 40 freaking shifts.\n        â”œâ”€â”€ true. thx for all the info\n        â””â”€â”€ heyy again, I forgot to ask something. what makes you say that the rankings are random?\n            â””â”€â”€ There is no normalisation,  extreme lack of transparency, and 40 shifts. \n\nWith approximately 500 students a shift, u _cannot_ apply percentile based normalisation.\n\nIf u feel rankings will not be random after knowing all this... then idk.\n\nI had a rank of ~600 in kcet, met, 99%ile in mains,  and 1300 in pessat ðŸ¤¡"
