  "title": "[Placements] Epsilon (Data Analyst) Online Test + PPT Round at PES",
  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI have an upcoming **Epsilon on-campus drive at PES University, Bangalore** for the **Data Analyst role**. I was told the process will have:\n\n1. An **online/coding test** (aptitude, technical, coding, etc.)\n2. A **presentation/PPT round** (not sure if itâ€™s on the same day)\n\nIâ€™ve heard mixed things and donâ€™t have clear details, so I wanted to ask:\n\n* Whatâ€™s the **structure of the online test**? (sections, time duration, coding vs. MCQs, difficulty level)\n* What kind of **topics** are usually tested? (SQL, Python, statistics, aptitude, reasoning, etc.)\n* For the **presentation round**, what is expected? (Is it about our projects, case studies, or do they give a topic on the spot?)\n* Do both rounds usually happen on the **same day**?",
