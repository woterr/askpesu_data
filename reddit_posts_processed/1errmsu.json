  "content": "I have secured a good rank in kcet and ll get both pes(rr) and bmsce colleges in ec branch. I have a personal interest in pes(rr) college but I have been seeing some comments saying that pes is good in placement wise but the 4 years of btech is going be a boring life and it is very strict, it's too hectic in pes. So what exactly strict means in pes.? All the colleges will have certain rules and regulations and may be PES has some extra rules. Will the fees in pes(rr) the same as mentioned by kea or is there also extra expenses? Also will the 4 years be a memorable and a worth one. Please help me with a clear explanation so that I can get to know about it.",
