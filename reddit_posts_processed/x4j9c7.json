So my question is are the hostels really that strict? Or is it a 1-2 month starting hostel phase of strictness and then its ok-ish types afterwards? And yo what about the maggi situation? Can’t even make them in the room? They also said we can’t movies on laptop?like wtf. Pls clarify.",

Electric cooker is not allowed cause they think you'll burn the place.   \n\n\nNobody cares what you do on your laptop. Throw away the rulebook, it's trash. Only strict rules are:\n\nYou have to be back in hostel by 9 pm.\n\nYou can't wear shorts.   \nYou can't bring day scholar friends into the hostel (unless you sneak them in).\n\nYou can go to your roommate's rooms. But after 10 pm they want you back in your own room, so occasionally they come after 10 to check. That's all.   \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can go out whenever you want, but if you want to spend the night at another house, you have to submit a form, call your parents, and then you'll be allowed to go.\n└── > Shorts are not allowed in places where the hostel authority can see (basically hostel office)\n> As mentioned above, whatever he said are the important points\n> DW points and all are trash, i would have got all the DW points xD"
