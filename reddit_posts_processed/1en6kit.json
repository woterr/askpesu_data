Run a couple of Python/C programs\n\nYou can use it in first year.\nâ””â”€â”€ what about 2nd year? ðŸ˜…  \nmy laptop is 3 years old and falls under the gaming category rn(battery life is shi.....)  \nshould i consider a new one for 2nd year?\n    â””â”€â”€ Think about it after you reach 2nd year. Most gaming laptops have the specs to last all 4 years, the only issue will be battery backup.\n        â””â”€â”€ Are there plugs in classrooms to charge laptop if needed\n            â””â”€â”€ Yes. There isn't one socket for each student, but there are many."
