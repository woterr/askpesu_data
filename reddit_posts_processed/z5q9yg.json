A few in the other fields such as cloud computing, etc. Product based don't need to have a research/novel angle to them (to be honest even research based projects don't need anything novel because this college values quantity over quality but that's a rant for another time).\n\nEvery branch at some point or the other is sent out a spreadsheet containing the list of projects that year. Maybe someone else here can send it across. I deleted all my PESU emails after graduation lolz"
