Had tried a few years back\n    â””â”€â”€ What's \"too hard\" about VS Code? For C/C++, just use it as an editor and use the terminal to compile manually. Ofc there's the options to set up compilation configs but you're better off doing it manually to learn how to compile and the steps in compiling files rather than automating a 2 second task, atleast when you're starting off with the language.\n        â””â”€â”€ not hard, but if setting up for first time, it takes some time. So, sublime text is much simpler i feel"
