      "body": "I'd recommend taking core CS. There is a detailed answer in the FAQs: https://bit.ly/pesu-faq\n\nTo summarise, although AIML is the boom right now, it's not for everyone. It's a lot of math and calculus. Secondly, undergrad is for fundamental knowledge building, not specialisation. It's not a good idea to restrict your options now and get stuck with a course you may not like.  Third, choosing core CS gives you the room to explore but also choose ML related coursework as electives in case you do happen to like ML. Fourth, it's an untested branch and college is taking bad decisions related to course planning."
