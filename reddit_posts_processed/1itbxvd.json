  "content": "I took one extra ST like an idiot since 2 STs were interesting, (we only had to take 1) is there any way I can withdraw it, since I didn't know that we have to PAY FOR THE EXTRA CREDITS... XO\n\nISA 1 will happen sometime in March, so technically it should be possible right? Can someone please help me figure out, or if someone was in a similar situation can you tell what to do?\n\nWhat will happen if I withdraw it when we get an option before ESA, since usually it gets transferred to next sem, so will it put my degree to hold?",
