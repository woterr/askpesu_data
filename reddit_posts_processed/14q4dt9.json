On joining the company it turns out he had only frontend related work.\n\nA decent number of ECE students do opt for higher studies, yes.\n\nGraduating from ECE, 8-8.5 is a pretty good CGPA, you should have nothing to worry about.\n└── oh alright   \ncould you give  rough range if possible?\n\nand do people generally go for MBA or MS"

It could be own venture,/entrepreneurship/work in a firm\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe actual work experience would open up perspectives which an individual had not thought of ..
