  "content": "I have been selected for an internship program in college where they said they will give 2 credits on successful completion. I want to know when do we get these credits. Do we get it after 5th sem or is it given after seeing our credits in final year ? My gpa isn't very good so can I claim these credits right after my internship completion to better my gpa ? ",
