      "body": "Bro switched to a different language for the second question so I'll try to answer the first one. The questions in gate will be based on what you study in clg. You'll have to study some extra stuff and solve a lot of questions but most of the concepts will be whatever you studied in clg itself. You'll have no classes in 7th and 8th semester so if you're serious about gate you'll have almost 10 months to prepare"
