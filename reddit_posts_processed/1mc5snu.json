The thing is I dont have a crazy GPA so I would like to know all options\n└── Also I've heard a few people say that DA isn't a good combo to handle along with BD unless you get gowri ma'am, how true is that? Should I look to switch from DA to something else during the first week in case I don't get her for DA?\n    └── yep gowri is super good, and it's not too easy to manage da without her. da is a useful course though, so it's your call. don't drop bd though it's one of the most useful subjects ever.\n        └── Yup I'm definitely taking BD, the toss up will be between AA and DA for me.  \nThanks a lot!"
