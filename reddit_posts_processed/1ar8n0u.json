      "body": "Your previous scores won't be affected at all. The subject will get added to your current semester. For example if your current sem has 24 credits, if you write the backlog and clear it, your sem report card will now show results for 28 credits and ypur sgpa will be affected accordingly. Getting a lower grade will reduce your sgpa even though it's not part of your semester and if you gey a good grade like A or S your sgpa will increase. Cgpa wise it makes no difference. Your previous report card where you failed will still show an F\n├── Oh okk\n└── Will your final report card have any indication that you failed something\n    └── No"
