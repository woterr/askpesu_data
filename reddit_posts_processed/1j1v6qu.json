Plus, they'll definitely know that the people on the other end will at least try to understand.\n            â””â”€â”€ Itâ€™s always the same few people talking on Discord, at least from the few times Iâ€™ve opened it. A lot of people here probably feel too awkward to join in, even with anonymity.\n                â””â”€â”€ Yeah, I can understand that feeling.  \nIt often feels like interrupting a group of friends and asking them to let you in.   \n  \nThe new server isn't perfect. but this thing is actually the least we can do.  \nbut we can make it work as a community.\n                    â””â”€â”€ Agreed"
