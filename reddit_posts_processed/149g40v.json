      "body": "Enc in rr closed at 3.7k in 2nd round last year. You might get aiml in EC campus , it's opening this year\n└── What campus is better rr or ec for me ec campus is too far which campus do you recommend to go to\n    └── Check out the campus videos on YouTube. And prefer branch over campus, if you don't like enc don't take it.\n        └── Thank you but if i get only ece in rr or ec campus what are my chances to change my branch to cse. I understand that i need to cross a min cgpa of 9.5 is it feasible to change branch if i get ece or eee.\n            └── From what seniors have told here , branch change is almost impossible and only 2-3 kids switch branches"
