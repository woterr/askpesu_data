So COE reduced his grade to A. But subjects i am applying for all have B or A\n        â””â”€â”€ Why tf did he apply when he got S grade?\n            â”œâ”€â”€ To reduce his grade duh..\n            â”‚   â””â”€â”€ The batches keep getting dumber and hornier.\n            â””â”€â”€ bruh I think ive heard of this story before \n\nSome guys father applied review for S grade thinking its the worst grade. Then it got reduced.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't buy it tho."
