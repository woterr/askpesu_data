But I'm not sure as of what extent of features are allowed to be used (databases, integration with other languages etc)\n\nEdit: And yeah, this question was asked previously.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/yxn3yg/first_year_python_mini_projects/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button\n└── Oh okay... As pygame is not included in the syllabus, is it advisable to do a GUI based project or should I continue with a simple DBMS project (just asking, I am really confused) \n\nAnd yes i saw the link, thank you for sharing that! :)\n    ├── I think yes, you could do a GUI based project or a DBMS, coz I had a peek at a list of possible topics and found that the standard of questions is really high. So just go all-out!\n    └── You can use pygame, but your marks come from using concepts in your syllabus. Making a fancy thing is nice but ensure to cover most aspects of your syllabus as well\n        └── Okay \nThank you so much for informing this!!"
