  "content": "Hello. \nAsking a high school teacher from Gujarat. Is TAMS worth the experience ? The Amateur Manager and Scientist festival sounds really exciting but the Uni has surprisingly no images or videos of past TAMS events. \nWe already give our students a lot of hands-on activities to initiate learning.\n\n Here's some information about our school : We are an IB school. No textbooks and no exams till grade 9. Only project work needed and all of the classes are linked to projects. \n\nGiven this, can you tell us if this feat would be a worthwhile experience in general or not ? \n\n\nThanks ",

You may/may not know him (iykyk)"

It’s all about real-world thinking, team challenges, and creative problem-solving. Since your school already focuses on project-based learning, your students would definitely vibe with it.\n\nYou mentioned there weren’t many pics/videos online — we recently put everything up on our official website, including all the event details and a full gallery from past editions! You can check it out here:  \n🌐 [https://tams.pes.edu](https://tams.pes.edu)\n\nHope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions, I’d be happy to share more.\n\nWarm regards,  \nTAMS Team"
