Bro deserves to be beaten for shit like that .\n├── I've seen random old outsider uncles strolling and jogging around campus in just a banyan and chaddi early in the morning. And the bouncers are busy harassing kids without ID cards.\n│   ├──  Bruh ec campus they don’t even check ID I only wear them for my exams\n│   │   └── Bouncers caught me in pixel for not wearing an ID card\n│   └── Inside the the main building they will catch you if you dont wear ids, near cricket ground and all they dont care. Mostly it is some sort truce between the locals and the clg to allow ppl to come near the ground and get out as soon as students start coming.\n└── how old is this?"
