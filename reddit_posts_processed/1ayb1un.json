      "body": "Civil/ Chem as a subject will be completely useless unless you care about it. So in that regard PES would be better. \n\n\nHowever, the exposure and opportunities that NIT Surathkal can offer you is leagues and leagues ahead of anything PES can offer. PES is a school. This isn't a \"University\". It's a school that has some clubs on the side. That can be a good thing or a bad thing. That's up to you. \n\n\nPES is a lot more upto date with respect to syllabus. That is one thing I can honestly praise PES about. They are always trying to update the syllabus and change stuff up for the better. That's something NIT Surathkal can't even compete with. \n\n\nTL;DR: NITK gives better opportunities and exposure. PES has better syllabus, upto date subjects and is constantly changing( slightly for the better)\n└── Thank you bro..."

      "body": "I think i can answer this. I got Chemical in NIT Surathkal and i paid the fees and booked that seat. But when i got CSE in PESU i switched here , just because of branch. And i can 100% say that this was the best decision of my life.  The branch matters a lot , everyday i see on the linkedin , Job openings for BTech in CSE , but you will never find a opening like that for other branches.\n\n  \nI am in 3rd year, And i have already completed a internship in US company. Also through campus placements i got a PPO offer + summer internship 2024 in a big US company ( stipend 1lakh+). So i would say if you really work hard in PES, you can get lots of good things from them. The clubs are great (I have gone to IIT Bombay for a competition through my club). Sports facility is great, boys hostel is really fun ( Really costly tho). But the best thing about PES is its located in bangalore, the IT hub of india. You will get lots and lost of opportunity here, i have friend in iit kharagpur, who are still searching for internships. So it really depends on you. I also know people in NIT surathkal CSE who are really struggling to find a opportunity. I would say till now easily 20+ really good companies have come to PES for summer internships ( Which is not happening in Top NITs). \n\n  \nThe seniors are great in PES, i know many seniors doing Masters in US (in top colleges like CMU), they are supportive and helpful. That said this is only my experience in PES, I know people in my class which really hates pes. But it depends on you 100%.\n\n  \nBecause i left the seat after the last round , i lost around 80k Rs but i feel it was worth it. Civil/Chem has no value in the market right now. Go for CSE , or worst case electrical branch. Location of the college also matters a lot.\n├── Thank you for saying all this bro.. This was really needed.. Thanks for your help...\n├── What's the hostel fees??\n│   └── its like 1lakh+ every year, but the food and rooms are really good. 3rd year you can get solo rooms with attached washroom , its really good.\n│       └── how much for solo rooms  per year ?\n└── Mtlb kucch bhi \nBro don't compare any IIT/NIT with a prvt college\n    └── Not comparing, IIT/NIT much better. But yeah branch also matters, but the most important thing is how much you put effort. If you work hard , college/branch all secondary things. \n        └── Still i would say if u get an IIT or NIT \nOne must not leave it"

And I also talked with seniors of iiits they said to consider iiits as a 2nd option..\n    └── If your income is below 15Lpa and you get 7+ cgpa your fees will be lesser than bits. If it's above 8.5 cgpa then you get 80% scholarship on fees essentially making it very affordable. \n\nSource: me, I study with 80% scholarship here"
