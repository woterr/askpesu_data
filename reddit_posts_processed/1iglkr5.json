The gist is this is just another useless form. But they'll ensure you give the assessment and bother you if you haven't, so give it sooner or later. \n\nAs far as I know, there's no visible outcome to this. They just force you to fill it and then keep your data. I remember one kid in my batch filled up everything pointing to he was borderline depressed and PES did nothing anyway lmao.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Oh f it's just for formalitiesðŸ˜±\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Pretty much, yes. Unless there are subsequent actions I'm unaware of.\nâ””â”€â”€ Random question - can we give the test from anywhere or do we have to sit in the exam section like ISA and ESA ?"
