  "content": "im done with all my competitive exams, now I have around 4 months of free time in hand. regardless of what college I get into (say i get into PES itself), taking a mental break -relaxing during holidays apart. what should I be doing during these 4 months. anything specific that will come in handy as soon as college starts, maybe certain skills?(like communication skills etc, or even technical skills) \nI'm just a workoholic and I don't want to waste 4 months doing nothing but play video games and end up regretting later. so if someone can suggest me helpful activities id be really greatful.",

Once college starts you won't get time to breathe!\nâ””â”€â”€ come on now, it's bad but it's not that bad. can you tell me with a straight face that you studied something until a week before every isa?ðŸ˜‚\n    â””â”€â”€ Yes I do study on a regular basis, I don't believe in \"last moment\" shit\n        â””â”€â”€ Yeah don't listen to them, consistency is key. Habits carry over, and a few years later \"last moment\" work will not cut it in the industry.

And once you are out of college, you don't really have a summer break anymore. I'd suggest to relax, do whatever you would like to do and give your mind and body a break. College is a whole new chapter and a pretty big step up in life. It is not going to be like school. Its best to just relax for now and tick things off your bucket list lol. \n\nYou don't need any prep or study to start college, just an open mind ready for the new experience.\n\nHowever if you absolute *want* to do something and you are looking at CS/ECE branches, I would highly recommend doing [MIT's missing semester course](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/).\nâ””â”€â”€ rightt . . . thanks"
