I mean it has to be mentioned somewhere that they are studying in rr branch right??\n    └── Bro even if its happening it would take 5 yrs min"

      "body": "Hypothetically speaking, if that happens then, how would the entire kcet thing work?? I mean ec has diff cutoff and rr has diff cutoff, so if ec students are shifted to rr then I dont think it'd be quite right for rr students... Also if that happens can we now consider the shifted ec students as equivalent to rr students???? Anyone please solve my doubt"
