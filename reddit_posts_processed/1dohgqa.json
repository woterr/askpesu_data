      "body": "The subjects taught in first year(sem 1 and sem 2) are basic subjects related to each branch of engineering. \nYou will also be having physics and chemistry ( either one  in a semester) and mathematics in both semesters. These are usually an extension of what is studied in 11th and 12th grades. \nFor CS related subjects, Python and C are taught in first year. You can start learning them or brush up your skills if you wish. The teaching will be from beginner level so do not worry. \nFirst year is common across all branches."
