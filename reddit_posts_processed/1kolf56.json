If your getting ece in RR then easily you will get CSE in EC Campus....so it would be worth joining there.....as the placements of both the Campus are almost same only.....\nâ”‚   â”‚           â””â”€â”€ I was speaking about rr campus, i heard ec campus is not that good, if not do u have any placements stats about ec campus\nâ”‚   â”‚               â””â”€â”€ Lmaof....no....lol....I have seniors over there...and also...regarding the placements.....they tend to be equal to RR Campus....as every recruiters in rr visit ec also....so it's worth it....if you get ece in rr and cse in ec....one should definitely go to cse in ec....this is what each and every seniors, mates and me say....\nâ”‚   â”‚                   â””â”€â”€ Ohk thanksÂ \nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Atleast they have tried to maintain equality in term of fees ðŸ˜…\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ It's not equality lmaooo....it's business.....they don't give a f about equality....\nâ””â”€â”€ You can get some % of the fee refunded if you belong to sc/st and have an income certificate as a scholarship. You still have to pay fee and only your tuition fee can be refunded."
