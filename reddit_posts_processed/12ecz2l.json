Our class teacher told us to make union bank accounts for scholarship and people eligible for any of the three scholarships had to submit their front page of passbook.\n    └── It was supposed to be sarcastic, anyhoo you'll get in a few weeks usually before the consecutive sem ends.\n        └── how on earth is that supposed to be read as sarcastic lol."
