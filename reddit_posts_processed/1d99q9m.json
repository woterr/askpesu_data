  "content": "Hi guys.I have gotten a seat in PES through PESSAT first round counseling (AIML). This issue is, with my KCET rank (2.5k), I won't be getting  seat in AIML in the first round KCET counseling itself, but there is a high chance in second round. The doubt is, do I have to give up my PESSAT seat in order to attend 2nd round KCET counseling/ is it not possible for me to attend 2nd round KCET counseling once I submit all original documents by June 30th? Can a senior or anybody please guide me through this?  \n",

But if u join any other college, then the fee would be deducted\n├── so we can attend cet counseling without giving up the pessat seat?\n│   ├── Yes\n│   └── Definitely\n└── but the second round cet counselling results would be declared around September and classes would have already started wouldnt it?\n    ├── Yes. KCET students will join late and have a separate section/batch for the first semester. From the 2nd sem, its the same for all students regardless of how you were admitted.\n    │   └── so can I still go for kcet counselling when the college has already started for pessat students? thanks in advance\n    │       └── Yeah you can\n    └── Yes u can, as long as ure continuing in PES, they don't mind, whenever u get a seat through kcet, ur fee structure would be changed. I confirmed this by going to the campus and talking to them about a week ago\n        └── alrighttt tysm"
