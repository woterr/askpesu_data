There are way too many people, and if youâ€™re not willing to put in the work to be at the top, a good placement isn't gonna fall into your lap\n        â””â”€â”€ thanks bro this motivated me bro thanks so can i still expect to land a job if i work hard even if i have ended up in a bad college?\n            â””â”€â”€ Pes students only struggling for job,what u think u will get in some shitty college\n                â””â”€â”€ Bro dont scare meðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­\n                    â””â”€â”€ You should be, seeing your situation"

The volunteers are treating people who paid 1k+ like dogs and are making them stand in the sun for hours not even providing water. On the study side the college is better but just know that this college is like a school so make your choice very carefully.\nâ””â”€â”€ Bro wat bout placement package and czn i hope to land job if i work hard even if i am in shitty clg\n    â”œâ”€â”€ Job placements you will get. Pes is better than other tier 2 tier 3 colleges in that comparison.\n    â””â”€â”€ In shitty college well you will get max infosys, capegemini and cognizant giving you upto r.5 lakh jobs. Once in a while 10 lakh. Nothing greater than that\n        â””â”€â”€ Am done with my lifeðŸ˜­\n            â””â”€â”€ you can always grow from there. At the end of the day college gives you 2 year boost at max paycheck wise. its chill"
