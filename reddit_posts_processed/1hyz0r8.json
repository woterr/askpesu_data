You're scum and nothing more. \n\nPeople like you are the reason that academic institutions abroad and academia look down upon the research that comes out of India. Any kind of research output from our country is, seen with sceptical eyes, doubted and not taken seriously because of the number of predatory conferences that are out there and the shit that gets published in the name of research in them. It's people like you who created a bad name for genuine researchers who actually care about doing some good work and publishing good research."
