      "body": "Take an actual interest in the topics, explore topics and then slides. Helps you remember much better and makes it bearable and maybe even fun\n└── Second this, physics is that one subject that you can’t treat the same as others, my advice would be to attain a deep understanding of all the topics covered, don’t just read the slides, but go see videos and just learn more abt it. Doing this was the only reason I got an A in it, even without any relative grading"

      "body": "I got an A (almost S) because I paid attention in class—physics is easier if you follow along with the teacher and then revise at home. Unit 2 is the key: most concepts from Units 3 and 4 are just extensions of it. If you’re solid on things like tunnels, V>V0, V < V0, INFINITE, FINITE WELLS ​, you’ll sail through the subject.\n\nScoring is easier in the ISA than the ESA, so aim for around 30 marks in the ISA to secure an A. A tip that really helped me: I made my own 60–75 page physics notes, even though slides and PESU notes were available. They were a lifesaver during ESA revision."
