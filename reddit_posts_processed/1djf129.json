Add those to your post and I will update my comment.\n└── hey thanks for your reply \nwe can't edit image posts so I'll list out the courses here \nElective 1:\n\nAdvanced Algorithms\nData Analytics \nInternet of Things \nApplied Cryptography\nVirtual and Augmented Reality \nHuman Computer Interaction \n\nElective 2:\nEnterprise Business Systems \nBig Data\nGraph Theory and it's Applications\nBio-inspired Computing \nAdvanced Computer Networks \nComputer Network Security\nRobotics with ROS\n    └── Useful electives: Adv. Algo, Data Analytics, Big Data\n\nScoring electives (this is subjective, and the syllabus changes every year so its not possible to predict): Data Analytics, IoT, HCI, ERP, Graph Theory\n        ├── Is data analytics scoring for someone who is weak in maths\n        │   └── The course is basically a math course. It depends on what kind of math you do not like. There isn't any calculus, its mainly stats and probability and a bit of algebra. I would suggest going through the syllabus to figure it out.\n        │       └── Is applied cryptography scoring?\n        └── Even applied cryptography was a pretty scoring elective last year.\n            └── Ah, it wasnt really scoring 1-2 years ago. \n\nAs I said, scoring is pretty subjective. HCI and a bunch of other courses alternate between being easy and difficult."
