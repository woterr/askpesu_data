So keep an eye on that.\n└── do all clubs give out links on the app? or just the bigger clubs... I'm interested the photography club at the EC campus hence the question\n    └── Yes almost all the clubs do give out forms on pesuacademy itself, u can checkout the discord server as well.\n        └── i don't think every club has a discord server so.. idk how to contact them\n            └── The main discord page has announcements where it is often mentioned which clubs are recruiting and the google form will also be available, so check that out. Pes27, pes19 all have\n                └── okay thanks"
