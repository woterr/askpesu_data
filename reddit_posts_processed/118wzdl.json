      "body": "Firstly, placements are held together for both campuses so campus is irrelevant. Secondly I'm going to assume CSE and answer because you haven't mentioned branch. \n\n1. Most companies keep it above 8, a few at 8.5 and a handful at 9. Although do note that there is a big difference between being eligible to sit for placements and your CGPA being competitive enough to get selected for interviews.\n\n2. Most if not all companies have the same CGPA cutoffs on or off campus. Remember that off campus is always the harder route to getting placed, you're competing across the country for the role."
