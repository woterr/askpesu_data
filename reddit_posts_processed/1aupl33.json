It is a bit hard after 3rd sem in ECE due to there being so many numericals where you can make mistakes but 9.5+ is definitely achievable. Highest I've seen after 3rd sem is a 9.92 in sem 5. But there's someone in RR campus ECE with a 9.8 cgpa so that person probably got 10 in a few sems\n└── Ohh tq"
