I too joined PES because I was left with no better options but I'm just being realistic here. The 4.5 lakh fee is not worth it at all unless you join as a kcet student, the management sucks ass, the student intake is too high, and the academic pressure is a lot worse if you compare it with other colleges in blore. I could go on.\n\nAnyway I'm just saying that people should look at both sides before joining the college.\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ How do you say Management Sucks ??\nâ”‚           â””â”€â”€ my guy, your entire comment history is just you being extremely defensive about a college that doesn't give a shit about you. go touch some grass\nâ””â”€â”€ The Capacity in RVCE is 1500 The Capacity in BMSCE is 1800 The Capacity in PES(Main Campus) is 1620 The Capacity in PES(EC Campus) is 1080 Just the Thing is PES is Computer Science Centered College"
