I worked for cave labs(AR/VR) during my summer internship (the summer between my 4th and 5th sem) and there it was like this arrangement with a particular company that did AR/VR stuffs for other companies. We had this contest, the person whose product was the best would get a first prize and so on. There were 3 prizes like this, highest being 7500 for the team (of 3) and the 3rd prize was around 2500 for the team. The rest of the teams got about 1000 bucks. But none of us were aware of this being a thing until after we joined so none of us joined for the money, but yeah we got some"
