Could you be more specific?\n├── As in what tools can I use to make pictures.\nLike in my thing I have to use 3d cnn so like i can't just copy paste from other papers or internet that's what our sir said .\nHe said to make own pics and own visualisation for the review paper.\nReview paper will be published now and the main paper later on in 8th sem\n│   └── You can use draw.io\n│       ├── Draw.io I have used that to make all those diagrams swimlane sequence entity diagram etc.\nI need something to make images of the model\n\nWell now ya we have to write 2 papers one review paper and one for the main project we build.\n│       │   └── You can make all those diagrams using draw.io itself. I've used it to create diagrams for my papers. There isn't any automated tool as far as I'm aware that makes these diagrams. A lot of researchers also use powerpoint to make the figures and then export them.\n│       ├── [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nHmTpgdgCgxuHdYcATvDss6cQBnaS5cn34eSUu779B4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nHmTpgdgCgxuHdYcATvDss6cQBnaS5cn34eSUu779B4/edit?usp=sharing)  \ngo to the survey paper section i need help w that\n│       └── Bro, not every team **has to publish 2 papers**.
