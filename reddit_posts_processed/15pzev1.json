No difference at all.\n└── Ok , thanks for ur advice,I'll consider it\n    └── Hey bro , I am attending my counselling this year and I have the same doubt . As you are senior can you suggest me which is better , jss or pes (ec) . Please\n        └── Pes EC is better, some of my friends in jss say that it's not good ,pes is far better than that bro in terms of curriculum and placements,but you should be ready to study consistently that's it ,I'd recommended PES\n            └── Thanks a lot . And is there any difference in placements for ec campus students compared to rr campus or is it conducted commonly for both campuses ?"
