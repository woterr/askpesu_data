If u are coming to PESU, take CSE. \n\nI am 6th sem ECE, I can guarantee tat ECE is hard as fuck, dont join it and its not worth it\n├── how about  eee and mech? I just don't like  cse\n│   ├── Donno bro, all are hard in their own ways. Nothing is easy from now on\n│   ├── I'm from eee 4th sem prolly the toughest sem for eee\nBut eee in general is tough ngl\n│   └── 2023 mechanical grad here, unless you are “extremely” passionate about mechanical engineering (automotive / aerospace) and physics in general, I would suggest you not to take up Mech at PES. Our batch probably had the last remaining good professors. There are handful remaining good ones and the others are straight up BAD. Some subjects are meant to be difficult and with sub par teaching, it becomes even more difficult.\n│       └── Is prof chandrashekara still there? I believe he i one of the few good ones left in the clg right? 2020 batch.\n\n we published a paper along with him and presented it in NIT Amritsar and Germany, some of the best memories in this clg are in 3rd and 4th year.\n│           └── Yeah Dr. CVC was there when I left college. I believe he’s still there but is going to retire in a year or two. Probably one of the passionate teachers in the Mech department. Simply loved to attend his DOME and MV lectures !\n│               └── He is been telling this since I was there, His daughter was also part of our group when we did that research paper.  However, I got really busy and lost contact with him.\n└── Na man, don't listen to anyone. Not only ECE, every engeneering is hard in one aspect or other.
