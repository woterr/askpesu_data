  "content": "\n  \nits been 6 months since i came on campus and my roommate is addicted to brainrot. seriously, I enter the room and am greeted by a cacophony of \"ohio skibidi\" reels or the 439th variant of \"I just lost my dog\". first it was \"bill collecter\" memes, which I used to find funny too, but now its just straight up gibberish with a \"goofy ahh\" soundtrack in the background and thats all it takes for my roommate to fucking lose his shit. As i write this post hes telling me about some fucking \"hawk tuah and spit on that tang\".   \n  \nwhy does it bother me so much? i think that now in an effort to be \"edgy\" or \"skibidi\", people like to throw in some vague illustrious brainrot reference which is supposed to make people laugh. I tried venting to my roommate and at the end of my rant he says :\"you hawk gyat tuah be kidding me\" and i swear to god i almost fucking lost it. I swear to god if i hear another fanum ohio rizzler reference or some BULLSHIT im going to throw hands. (My roommate just encountered a new variant of \"I just lost my canine companion\" and is giggling again). idek what to say at this point except that we're fucking deteriorating as a species and its only a matter of time before we de-evolve back to supine protoplasmic invertebrate jellies, or as my roommate so eloquently phrases it, \"return to monke\".",
