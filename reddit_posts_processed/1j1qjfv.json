So nobody knows in detail about the admission process right now and there are definitely many knowledge gaps and missing information about the end-to-end process. I'd highly recommend you to reach out to them directly instead of asking around on reddit.\n└── Yea I figured so gonna call them and ask tdy or drop by pes for a couple mins"
