  "content": "Yeah, as the title, I'm aware that some colleges allow you to change your branch as in subjects, if your cgpa has met the requirements, but I've been seeing a lotta people claim that students studying in ec branch can change to rr branch if their cgpa is greater than 9.7 or so(for cse) and 9.0 for any other branches , given that rr branch has vacancy for them , I just wanna know how legit is this information???",
