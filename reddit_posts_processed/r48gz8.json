  "content": "Hello folks of PES!\nI just recently finished my Diploma course and I have paid the 3.4L fees at PES (RR Campus). I have been told that Maths is particularly difficult for Diploma students. What are some things I should know in PES particularly? What are the difficulties and tips I should know about the college before joining? I have started to come across a lot of red flags on the internet that the course is particularly challenging for diploma students? If so, what should be my approach to be able to handle the difficulties (eg: tuitions, extra courses, etc)\n\nAdditionally, I would like to know how safe PES is for LGBTQ+ students.",
