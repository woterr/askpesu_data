And that random guy who can't stop saying \"so on and so forth\". The way they act like a bachelor's at pes is some world renowned feat. And the fact that there's literal bouncers everywhere. \n\nBro makes it look like a politician's backyard\n│       └── Dude confidently implied that PES is on par with IITs when he was addressing 2nd and 3rd year students a few weeks ago.\n│           └── Don't you know? By 2069 pes will overtake iitb. Not only that it will compete with universities across the globe. \n\nYou might not see it now, but the updated syllabus is leaps and bounds ahead of the competition. Students are taught quantum physics in the first year, imagine what they'll be able to do in 4\n│               ├── Dude fr mentioned in the orientation (2nd year's) that in some years pesu is gonna be the most technically advanced university globally\n│               ├── You jest, but this is something I can definitely imagine Jawahar saying.\n│               └── Kind of far fetched claims. In karnataka itself they have tough competition to catch up with like iiitb who also have updated syllabus and dream packages.\n│                   └── Call me when those people are leaving advanced quantum physics in their first year\n└── Jawahar told that in orientation today"
