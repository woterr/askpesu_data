Getting in, is all on the students and their performance in placement tests and interviews\n└── >No one can really answer the is it better than BMS/MSRIT\n\nI mean wrt to companies that come on campus\n    └── Ig you can ask on a BMS or MSRIT subreddit, they may give a list of all companies... For PES, the orginal post has the PDF! (Link already shared)\n        └── wait there;s no pdf on that link\n            └── Here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/17zEt7xdUs2cVWytO770XDjkSuvO7xO9O/view\n                └── Thanks"
