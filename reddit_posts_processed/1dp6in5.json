Idk abt u,can't comment,but yeah u have to be a genius if u want to balance everything\n    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Update us on how his BITSAT goes. Because if their BITSAT is screwed up too then dude would have effectively fucked up both PES CGPA as well as partial drop\n        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ I'll try to get in contact with him.It takes time though,I'll reply here itself if I manage to do it.\n            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Sure, thanks."

But basically some of the clubs here tend to plan events last moment and don't exactly respect time and efforts from the side of the club members. The club heads are insanely out of touch with the rest of the team and after a point, even if you joined just for fun you stop enjoying and it just adds to your never ending pile of work\n        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ yes they arent mandatory but yk, if i join might as well have decent clubs(i thought id join like 4 different ones and theyd be awesome cuz pes)"

I had spoken to BITS seniors, the director or some guy of pes was placing before me the most medicore of stats and some old as satellite with Modi's tweet n shit. They told electives and I was like \"huh that's all?\" (In context BITS has 40+ electives of CS alone and we can do any course of any other department as well if we're interested)\n\nSo I told my parents to withdraw their money (10k gone). Either I go BITS else I take a drop and try for some other good college. \nThankfully I didn't have to take a drop and got BITS. So yay."
