  "content": "So I got EC CSE thru pessat,my main goal is to become a pilot but my dad says it's better to pursue aerospace engineering at RVCE(will get it thru COMEDK) since it's inline with my interest but my view is that holding a cs degree from a reputed college like PES will serve as a backup since it's hard to get a job in any airline due to huge competition for few opportunities.\n\nAlso Im ready to do either of them and have equal interest on both branches but just wanted the best option..\n\nPs:how hard is it to get the 40% scholarship in PES?,cuz pilot training is expensive and would like to reassure my parents that pes might be a reasonable choice and not burden them with 5L a year, cuz my dad also pointed out that most of the 40% scholarship might be eaten by the students coming through kcet/jee.\n\nwould love to get some opinions and advice on this🤓🙏🗿",

      "body": "You doing a degree in aerospace engineering will not make you a pilot and honestly, you have to put the same amount of effort as an aerospace engineer to become a pilot as compared to any other engineering stream...\n\nIf you are dead serious about becoming a pilot; prefer a course that's easy to complete (a course you like) and then dedicate time in getting a licence and stuff\n\nI have friends who have chosen BSc for the same reasons, they'll get time to prepare\n└── Yeahh that makes sense i assumed they would prefer aerospace engineers since they would have a better idea of the aircraft than a regular candidate, thankyou!\n    └── Yup, a lot of people assume this, but, the difference is negligible because BTech Aerospace Engineering teaches you thermodynamics, aero and fluid dynamics in great depths \n\nA pilot need not know all this! The basics of a plane, I guess the pilot school will also teach"

Trying to be a pilot is very risky financially, don't take another rust by taking aerospace engineering as well.\n\nAlso, anyone with a reasonable interest in college can easily get the scholarships.\n└── I see, thanks for the info!!"
