So if you're in first year there's a lot of time for that, lot of things might change\n\nBut if you're interested, they range from cybersecurity topics, systems, and ones in ML. Since there are many courses and if you're interested, you can ask anyone for the latest course information on the discord server. It has the listed electives.\n├── Hi! I’m currently in my second year(fourth semester). But yeah, I forgot about the electives being listed out on the discord server. Thanks for the help! :)\n└── \"systems\"\n    └── That's what the specialisation was called for us if I remember correctly, I could be wrong though :)\n        └── Lol I just meant that there aren't too many systems courses being offered anymore, especially since HP got axed"
