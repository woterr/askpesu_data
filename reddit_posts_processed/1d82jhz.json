They take into account the overall score.\n└── companies keep over 90 isn't the max they usually go for 75?\n    └── Very few, probably a handful, have the 90% requirement.\n        ├── What's the minimum criteria for majority of companies ?and is it aggregate in all five subject or just pcm ?\n        ├── 90% in both 10,12 or the avergae of them should be 90??\n        └── even for 10th? why do they go so far back. i got like 75% in 10th, but above 90 in 12th. will it haunt me forever lmao"
