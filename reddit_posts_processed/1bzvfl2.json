There's no aiml in third year, and there's more than double aiml in first year. But let's average 240 aiml for all three years\n\nThat totals to about 1700*3. That's 5100\n\nSeeing how many people are talking about it and sharing the form and stuff, i wouldn't be surprised if 1 in 4 or 5 people applied conservatively I'll say there's probably 1000 applications. \n\nNow you'd make the mistake of thinking that if you're generally in the top 5% (50/1000) you might get it. But what you're missing is that it's probably the smarter more achieving people that are applying to this. So i would think you're going to have to be like the top 2-3 percent of your batch. \n\nTLDR PES is the vit of Bangalore, you're probably not going to get the internship by a long shot\n├── yeah you’re right, i have a few back-up options as well but there’s no harm in being prepared\n│   └── Yeah I was just injecting some reality lol. \n\nYou mind sharing the other ones you were talking about. No harm in adding one more competitor right\n│       └── yes sure here are a few other ones, and i love some healthy competition:))\n\n1) Summer Project with IEEE CS PESU\n\n2) Summer Project with IEEE RAS PESU\n\n3) Research paper / Project with your favorite Professor\n\n4) PES Innovation Lab Summer Internship\n\n5) ISFCR Summer Internship\n\n6) IOT Summer Internship \n\n7)  CDSAML (Center for Data Science and Advanced Machine Learning)  Summer Internship\n\n8) CCBD (Center for Cloud Computing and Big Data)  Summer Internship\n\n9)   CIE SUMMER WORKSHOP\n\n10) Sit at home and learn. Do competitive coding and open source.\n│           ├── hey, how did you apply for 1,2 or 5?? (just curious)\n│           │   └── it usually comes on the app eventually\n│           └── Is the CDSAML form out, this year yet??, if not when could it be out\n│               └── not sure when it’ll be out yet\n├── At least let him try bud, people crack jee with way tougher odds.\n└── Good set of stats i see, thank you for doing the math, caring about the data is step one :)\n\nWrite the test. Don't let pessimistic thoughts hold you back - the lab is a place worth contesting these odds for. Just prep yourself on general problem solving and mental ability, and you should be good to go.\n    └── You're a member or something aren't you?\n\nPlease tell me the number of applications. I honestly want to know how close I am\n        └── Confidential :)\nYou are not too far away from it ever though, thinking about it statistically is a good sign\n            └── Haha put in a good word for Annie reaction"

Having taken these interviews and tests before, I would say don’t worry. They don’t usually judge you on your technical performance alone (esp for first years). For interviews Have a project to talk about. Know in depth about it. If you don’t get through don’t worry there are other labs."
