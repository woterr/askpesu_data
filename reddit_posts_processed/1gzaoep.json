      "body": "Many people will tell you that the textbook is a must for DDCO, MPCA and OS courses. They are some of the best books for these concepts. Read the book - you will see that they explain way better than the slides possibly can. Besides, questions in the ESA will require you to understand the concept very thoroughly and apply them, without knowing them properly, you will eventually screw up. The questions in the book help you develop that understanding.\n\nIf you don't want to believe me, go through all the comments about DDCO here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/1gx7ar0/which\\_is\\_the\\_toughest\\_cse\\_paper\\_in\\_3rd\\_sem\\_esa/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/1gx7ar0/which_is_the_toughest_cse_paper_in_3rd_sem_esa/)"
