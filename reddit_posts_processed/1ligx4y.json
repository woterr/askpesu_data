If you're academic orientated then pes is good but if you're looking for a rly good clg life Mit Manipal and Vit Vellore id definitely what you should go for.\n└── Vit vellore college life🤡\n    └── clg life is better there anyday\n        └── Yes, 7pm hostel curfew with mandatory attendance,  pda officers everywhere, no contact with the other gender, more cse seats than people in Tamil nadu, so much competition. Funnest jail in india, you'll really enjoy your life😃"
