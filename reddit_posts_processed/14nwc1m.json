She needs one either way\n            └── Umm\n\nCan't make these decisions for you man 😂\n\nAs an engineer, keep the tuf, it has a good Graphics Card\n\nIf you need to buy another, get a Dell or something (G series)\n                └── Thanks I was thinking to get an IdeaPad gaming 3 i5 12th gen rtx3050 one now will think about Dell G15 too .\nThanks a lot\n                    └── Get the IdeaPad. I have the older version and it's quite nice. The older version wasn't great at cooling but the newest version is significantly better. Check jarrods tech video on that. Also get the 165hz screen as well."
