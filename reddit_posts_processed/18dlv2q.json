      "body": "Hey have you received any info about the same???\nEven I have shortlisted pes for mba through pgcet\nâ””â”€â”€ What's your ranking?\n    â””â”€â”€ Mines 238\nWhat's yours\n        â””â”€â”€ Mine is 274. \nAs much as I have enquired till now. The fees may range from 1,00,000 - 1,50,000 per year depending on your category. The campus is good and placements depends upon your skills.\n            â””â”€â”€ How would you rank rvim compared to pes??\nYeah the fees is yeah around that range \nYou know pes has trimester system right?\n                â””â”€â”€ I don't know i haven't researched more about RVIM. Let me know if you have any information about that college. What is the fee structure? What else do you know?\n                    â””â”€â”€ Rvim fees comes around 1.4L per year\nThe hostel is not preferable but you'll get pgs in the area easily\nThe courses and curriculum is nice\nAnd placements obviously depends on each individual\n                        â””â”€â”€ Oh right! Do you think trimesters will be too hectic to handle?\n                            â””â”€â”€ Yeah i guess i imagine it to be very hectic honestly\nThere's also case studies and research papers and all that\n                                â””â”€â”€ Yeah right. Do you think it all will be worth it? \nI am confused too. Is it bad thing that it'll be hectic?\n                                    â”œâ”€â”€ It isn't necessarily bad cause it depends how each individual handles the academics\nI think it will be worth it honestly\nBut personally I'm unsure if i could handle the schedule so I'm hoping to get into rvim\n                                    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Yeah, you are right.\n                                    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Hey  pes is accepting pgcet scores right???\nAlso upon detailed enquiry rvim doesn't seem like a great choice\nSeniors are recommending dayanand Sagar or msr.\n                                    â”‚           â””â”€â”€ Yes. PES accepts PGCET. Today KEA released seat matrix, which also includes PES. So yeah\n                                    â”‚               â””â”€â”€ I didn't find it in the list so i enquired about it with the college and they said they do and are accepting rank under 500\n                                    â”‚                   â””â”€â”€ It is a private college, the list of private colleges is in page number 64 of the seat matrix PDF. Your rank is under 500 right? So what's the problem?\n                                    â”‚                       â””â”€â”€ Up until now I wasn't sure about pes so that was the problem \nThe holidays for pgcet students are non existent\nAnd the timing is 8 to 6 45\nSo no social life at all\n                                    â”‚                           â””â”€â”€ Oh no. 8am-7pm is crazy. I also heard that they treat grownup students like school children. I read a reddit post saying that. So i think it might be very strict.\nBut why do need to attend classes for 11 hrs. Are they teaching something special? I don't think we'll get enough personal time.\n                                    â”‚                               â””â”€â”€ Yeah we won't possibly get time for ourselves in the first 2 trimester \nAlso 80% attendance mandatory\nLooking at the timing it does look like we're going back to school\nLet's see because the other best options are msr or dayanand Sagar and i actually have no idea how they are\n                                    â”‚                                   â””â”€â”€ Right. I asked my friend who is doing MBA through PGCET. She said that as management students are ahead of the PGCET students, to matchup with them they will take extra classes.. i think that's why college timings are 8am-7pm. She said that after 2nd sem it'll be more relaxed and they'll take lesser classes. I also asked her if dayanand Sagar and MSRIM are that good? She said that everyone says they are good but quality of education at PES is better as it is autonomous college. I am very confused about everything right now\n                                    â”‚                                       â””â”€â”€ I was pretty sure about pes but looking at the dynamics has gotten me all flustered about what college to choose\nAll things considered pes is the best \nIt's like back to square one and I don't know what to do next\nI don't have any idea about msr or dsu so it's very difficult to make a decision right now\n                                    â”‚                                           â””â”€â”€ You are soo right\n                                    â”‚                                               â””â”€â”€ Have you heard about tapmi\n                                    â”‚                                                   â””â”€â”€ I am sorry, i don't know. Can you explain?\n                                    â”‚                                                       â””â”€â”€ T a pai institute of management\nIts tier 2 b school and is accepting pgcet I will enquire with the college tomorrow I don't have enough details about it right now as I came across it a while back\n                                    â”‚                                                           â””â”€â”€ I read their accepting exams on their site, I did not find PGCET. Yes please enquire and let me know. \nDid you write CAT exam this year?\n                                    â”‚                                                               â””â”€â”€ Yes but in the seat Matrix I came across this college\nYes I did but I would rather not say my score as I just gave it because i had registered for it\n                                    â”‚                                                                   â””â”€â”€ Alright. If you enquire more about that college, let me know. Oh, it's okay. However your PGCET score is very great. I have also written CAT and I got decent result of 80 percentile. Due to my category, i might get into IIM Ahmedabad or banglore. My only reason for not to go for those colleges is because the fees for those colleges are off the roof. Do you think is it worth the investment of that much fees in those colleges? What's your opinion.\n                                    â”‚                                                                       â””â”€â”€ Honestly I have zero knowledge about iims but doing an mba through iims is a great feat so if not the without the financial constraints I would prefer an iim\n                                    â”‚                                                                           â””â”€â”€ Right!
