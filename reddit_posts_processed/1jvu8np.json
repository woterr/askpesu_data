I’m trying to build some cool projects around manipulating/working with bulk videos/photos using genai techniques and this is for my startup. \nIf anyone who’s decently sound in ai/ml and basic backend tech interested in using this as a playground, you can hmu. You’ll have full freedom to use whatever stack you want as long as the project is performing.\n\nIf it matters at all, I can offer a couple thousand per month and an internship certificate alongside some other opportunities.\n\n",
