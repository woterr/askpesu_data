  "content": "I received an email from PES university today asking us to confirm whether we have written kcet or not and upload the rank accordingly. I think only kcet students will be given an extension in the last date to surrender their seat. I wrote ComedK not kcet so I guess for people like me weâ€™ll have to surrender our seat by the earlier date mentioned - July 12th which is before ComedK counselling. What do I do? Anybody facing the same problem as me? What are your thoughts on this?",
