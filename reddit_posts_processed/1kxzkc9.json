If you have any other affordable options like BMSCE/MSRIT/RVCE. Ig that will be a lot better because the fees will be around 15L lesser than PES & MIT.\n└── I'm getting 103 marks in comedk so idk what I'll get through that but I might get scholarship in manipal (kinda a full fee waiver)\n    └── is your met predicted rank under 100???"
