  "content": "I will be vacating at the end of this month, if anyone is looking for a PG DM me, it's a single sharing room semi furnished with a cupboard, study table and a chair. There is CCTV surveillance in the building for safety. Wifi connectivity available.\n\nI can send you images of the room and the contact number of the owner on DM.\n\nLocation - Right behind F-Block (Adjacent to the college towards the left)\n\nPosting this because it was a pain for me to find a single sharing room when I joined PESU, thought this might help.",
