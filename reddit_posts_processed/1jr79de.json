  "content": "Hi All\n\n  \nI am looking forward to Interns who have hands on experience with Pytorch and coding ML challenges to join my venture.. I am building a Deep Attention based solution for transforming a huge pain point in IT Operations.. specifically with Incident Management and Root Cause Analysis..   \nYou can look at my linked Profile : [https://www.linkedin.com/in/santhosh-shankar-5156264/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/santhosh-shankar-5156264/)   \nThis is in a 0-> 0.5 stage and hence bootstrapped for now.. While monetary incentives are minimal, the opportunity to learn is huge AND definitely no theoretical , research projects.\n\n\\--Santhosh Shankar  \n\\+919972107070",
