  "content": "\nI observed that most of the posts in this sub Reddit do not pertain to PESU, but regarding college selection and choices for Comedk and KCET. It’s understandable that it’s a little overwhelming right now but people searching for interesting posts regarding this sub Reddit are getting lost . Request all of you to post such queries in     r/ComedkColleges. Use this sub Reddit only for questions pertaining to the college",
