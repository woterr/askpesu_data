No online classes.\n└── So will the total credits in a semester be 24? Are they totally irrelevant like EVS and constitution or related what are subject names ?\n    └── Yes 24 credits. Our batch had C++, R and Unix shell programming as options for special topics. They are not totally irrelevant. However they are not taught to depth either."
