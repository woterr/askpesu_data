Keep living in your delusion my dude.\n                                    â””â”€â”€ My guy, you clearly donâ€™t know anything about Rowlet.\n\nJokes aside, heâ€™s one of the most helpful people in this sub. He consistently clears everyoneâ€™s doubts and goes out of his way to guide others as an alumnus, even when many ignore posts like yours.\n\nSecondly, whether he is unemployed or not (he's pursuing his master's, afaik), that doesnâ€™t justify insulting him. Thereâ€™s no reason to be disrespectful.\n\nLastly, this community values mutual respect. If you donâ€™t fit in here, youâ€™re welcome to leave.\n\nHope thatâ€™s clear to you"
