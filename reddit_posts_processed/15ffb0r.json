Most of the stuff that youâ€™ll actually use in the industry. \n\nI slacked off during my 3rd and 4th sem, and I regret it now. \n\nLearn from otherâ€™s mistakes (mine) and put all the effort you can. 5th and 6th sem are very very easy, so Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll be able to get good scores then. \n\nAll the best!\nâ”œâ”€â”€ +1 and 3rd 4th sem is also usually the toughest\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ What is the syllabus for cs 3rd sem\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ Data Structures, Statistics for DS, digital design and computer organisation, web tech, automata and formal languages\nâ”‚           â””â”€â”€ tysm I appreciate it\nâ”œâ”€â”€ 3rd sem was my lowest ever GPA :(((\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Youâ€™ll be fine my man, youâ€™ve realised what you have to do in order to improve!\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ Yeahhh\nâ””â”€â”€ My cgpa is about 7.7 at the end of first year. Will it be practically possible for me to reach 8-8.5 from here or does it all go downhill\n    â””â”€â”€ Yes going from 7.7 to 8 is very simple, just get over 8 in the next 4 semesters. 3rd and 4th sem are a little tough and take effort. 4th sem will also have AT, so a lot more distractionsâ€¦.5th and 6th semesters are very easy to score in, so thatâ€™ll be easy, a little extra effort and youâ€™ll be able to get 9s both semesters."
