If you fail that too, then you'd end up with a backlog that would have to be cleared before you graduate. Not sure if you have to attend classes, but you need to clear the exams the next time the course holds its exams (which is with the next batch).\n└── Thank you! Do you know if my CGPA will improve if I clear the subject in the summer?\n    └── It will\n\nYour new grade will replace the old one\n        └── Thanks!"
