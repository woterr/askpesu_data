They will ask u to register your details on some google form , but they don't ask it that often\n└── This booking can be done only if I go there and do it?and is it compulsory 1 day prior? Like I can't book on spot and play if it's empty\n    └── Yes, u have to physically write ur name, court number and SRN.\n\nOn the spot I am not sure, they insist on booking 1 day prior, i however people still book 2-4 days prior too\n        └── Is there any kind of facility for the ones who want to play regularly? Like, can we book a court for a whole week starting from Monday to Saturday on Sunday? Is that allowed?"
