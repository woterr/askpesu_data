Also what is EAC?\n                    └── No I got it this yr through session 1 mains result\nEAC means Early Afmission Commitment...basically a counseling round before the 1st round counseling\n                        └── Ohh so cse core is possible for ec campus right?\n                            └── I think it is..tho competition will be more in 1st round counseling ig..but EC campus cse should be possible at ur percentile...if not core AIML for sure\n                                └── Let's hope for the best ngl"
