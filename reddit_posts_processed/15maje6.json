The info we got says we can get 2 or 8 credits during summers. Is it better to take a special topic/minor course instead of doing an internship? (For credits I mean).",

Internship is fun if you're doing it at a right place and most managers will give you a good grade if you don't mess around much :p\n└── Thank you!!"
