I got 99.6x percentile. Please let me know\n\nThank you!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/khk7v95tgxle1.png?width=1513&format=png&auto=webp&s=a058f5b938da90aec841424527a9f76ea9f9a322\n\n",

You're probably already aware that this is the first year they've done away with PESSAT. Besides, I graduated in 2022 so no clue how these things work now. \n\nAsk a current 1st year.

Since I'm happy, but I don't want to finalize anything until all the exams are over. (97.1x %ile)\n└── You have to pay the fees upfront, for me it shows 5.1lakh, and if you cancel your seat you'll get 5lakh refunded.\n\nI'm probably not going to pay in this round, and if my Session 2 result is not good enough for NITK CSE, I'll block a seat\n    └── Ah okay, thank you! Because I really wanna give NITs, IITs, and BITS my best shot, but my parents kinda value safetyand convenience so I'm worried they'll make me settle for pes too soon.\n        └── They'll refund it, don't worry.\n            └── Bro what is this? Comedk ke exams ke se milte h na ye sab clg?\n                └── pes was never part of comedk, it always had kcet and pessat major and little mains.

Not very particular about cse branch\n├── imo if your not particular on cse... then NIT will be better as placement opportunities and NIT tag is bigger.. (even if you get PES thru KCET)\n├── If branch doesn't matter, do NITK easily.\n├── obviously why join and suffer for 4 yrs here when u can chill in a private beach........\n└── Even if you were particular about cse, you could try for iiit bangalore cse (if fees isn't an issue). but since your not particular about cse ofc your options increase. At this percentile you have much better options than pes in my opinion"
