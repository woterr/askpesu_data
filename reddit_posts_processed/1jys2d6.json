  "title": "Lack of good looking men in PESU campuses",
  "content": "As a girl at PESU college, I am genuinely appalled by the absolute drought of good-looking men on this campus. Most boys here walk around looking like rejected SoundCloud rappers and Playboi Carti blasting through their earphones like it's their whole personality. It's giving zero hygiene and zero originality.\n\n\nI know that the nearly nonexistent representation of attractive men at PESU is likely tied to a few aspects, like how PESU is infamous for it's grind culture and tech-fests (not typically places where men with social skills thrive), the constant depressing and cold atmosphere, and the overall lack of awareness about grooming or basic style here.\n\n\nI know that my fellow PESU female students are also disappointed at the lack of tolerable men—they likely just hide their pain better than I am capable of. Or perhaps I am merely looking in the wrong places. I believe without finding a single guy with a jawline and a decent sense of self-awareness, my mental health will continue to plummet, and I may also have to look into transferring to Christ or NIFT if this issue does not get resolved.",

It’s like everyone collectively decided to abandon basic fashion, skincare, and the will to smile. I’m not even asking for supermodels, just someone who doesn’t look like they’re a jackfruit problem away from collapsing.\n\nHonestly, I don't know what’s going on with my campus, but it’s like the good-looking girls got a memo and decided to skip it this semester. I swear, it feels like every time I step out, I’m greeted by a sea of faces that look like they’re auditioning for a role in a \"before\" ad for a makeover commercial, like the ones you see when you open a random TV channel at 5 am.\n\nAnyone else feeling this drought, or is it just me?\n└── As a boy in PESU, I am genuinely concerned by the alarming lack of good-looking girls on campus.
