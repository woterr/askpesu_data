      "body": "Se mug up content in slides\n\nMl also very memory based, and involves remembering procedures to solve things. \n\nDBMS is the most reasonable in 5th sem imo, least mug up required\n\nBd is meh, you have to remember a lot of things, but it's not too bad at all\n\nDa idk\n\nBut for all subjects you should be good with slides. \n\nAt pes you never go \"oh no i didn't understand this concept, or oh no it's not in slides\"\n\nIt's always \"oh no i only remember 2 points but it's a 4 marker\""
