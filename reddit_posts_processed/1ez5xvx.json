Those notes will be important from placement poverty as well\n• Textbook questions? ( I never did them but I've been told it helps )\n• Participate in hackathons and events. ( Experience sake)\n\nProjects and certifications \n• Full stack projects are prefer\n• Keep Github and LinkedIn updated \n• Certifications are a bit important. Try doing one or two( Full stack and whichever stream u r interested in)\n\nPlacements\n• start coding from now or 2nd year pakka. Doesn't have to be strict everyday but weekly? (Regret not doing this)\n• Projects, work experience are imp ig\n• increase coding yearly. U learn more concepts in 2nd year. By the time placements come around it's much easier for u to think about the logic behind solving.\n\nThat's about it. I hope this helps a bit. I've told all the things i was told to do but didn't follow and now regret it GREATLY.\nLearn from your mistakes😭\n├── Bro where were u these days in this sub? such a good input!\n│   └── Thanks😂\n├── Which YouTube lectures are you referring to?

I didn't quite understand the second part tho?\n│       └── Nvm I'll figure out\n└── hey bro or u/rowlet-owl , many people are telling that rr aiml is now exactly same as ecity cs course wise..... forget about masters but for placements the recruiters won't sit and see ur courses right, they will see the degree and it will have aiml. so wont they recruite u moree for ml jobs like data analyst? ik the placements havent started but this is what I think.\n    └── I actually dk cuz aiml started in the batch after mine. Some companies do come for specific ml related so that may give a little edge. You still need to be well versed with ur course syllabus cuz most of it they might ask in placements. \nAlso degree they'll see only after u graduate during job changes, rn courses matter more. Your knowledge about those courses matters most.\n\nSo in my opinion not much difference?"
