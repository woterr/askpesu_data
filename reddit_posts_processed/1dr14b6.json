  "content": "4th sem here. Studying to clear my LAA backlog this July (summer term exams) and I have started to solve previous years QP. The only problem being that I am not able to find solutions to many questions (based on topics like: Eigen values, Orthogonal vectors etc) from the prev QP and am not able to correct my answers after a mock paper session. Anyone know where I can find solutions to previous years QP or is it even out there for me to find? Any sort of help or advice is appreciated. Thanks :)",
