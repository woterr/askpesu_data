Why will my butt hurt if my clg is better lmao\n    └── Makes sense, just did not understand the need for the over exaggerated title. There are two PoVs, either you’re from PES and feel happy or you’re from one of the IITs, NITs, BITS making fun of the institution. That opinion is from the title btw.\n        └── I left nit Surathkal for pes.. The statements that the guy made are top good to be true, but that isn't possible right..\n            └── That’s why it’s called satire. Also, saying that you left a university for another just makes you a person that is actually uninterested in PES. \n\nYou didn’t get a branch that you wanted, that’s not leaving a college. If you got CS at NIT, then moved here for CS, that is leaving a college for another. You chose this university with all sanity. Be proud of it.\n                └── >If you got CS at NIT, then moved here for CS\n\nI could have actually got cse , but in lower nits which are shittier than pes.. And i don't actually have a problem with pes.. I'm in fact happy for getting pes thru cet where the fee is 5l for the whole four years.. \n\nAnd coming to this post, this was actually a shit post made for fun and i have nothing to demean pes (why will i even do this)"
