This platform is for reading as much as creating posts.\n├── Ikr so impatient \nLater they will be begging for holidays which they won't be getting\n│   ├── doesnt starting late also mean less holidays?\n│   └── Its not about being impatient about classes. The same question has been asked multiple times and is redundant. Someone else might have a valid question and people might miss it.\n└── Instead of giving that long ass explanation you could’ve just told him the dates yk\n    ├── No. That doesn't solve the problem. People need to know how to use reddit if they expect good answers from the people on this sub.\n    ├── Instead of asking the same question again n again blud could have searched in this sub\n    └── NO. If people cared of how to use Reddit FAQs, **SEARCH BAR**, this wouldn't be a problem"
