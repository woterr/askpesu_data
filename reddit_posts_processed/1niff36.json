I got a tier 1 offer this year with a gpa of 7.5 so as long as it's 7+ you will have opportunities come your way. DSA and SQL are what you need to clear the interviews afterwards so focus on that and also this is my personal belief but you should also focus on your communication because if you're not able to convey your methods and understanding to the recruiter it's kinda pointless even if you have 9.5"

      "body": "Iâ€™ll go so far as to say that if you are maintaining a GPA above 8.5, you are eligible for (almost) all the tier 1 companies.\n\nNow, donâ€™t sweat the placement process already. Focus on building relevant skills. Itâ€™s great that you have started practicing DSA concepts - keep doing that.\n\nTry to build a strong network. Reach out to seniors, alumni, professors for opportunities.\n\nIdeally, if you manage to land a decent internship in 3rd year, try to convert that to a full-time offer so that itâ€™s one less thing to worry about"
