On days when classes finish at 1:45 we can't even go home because the bmtc doesn't ply from 1:30 to 2:30 because of shift change.\n    └── >because some students have medical conditions which requires them to eat on time\n\nLol, you think the college cares?\n        └── pes barely bothered when a student committed su1c1de, there's no way they care"

Now it's reversed. So u can't do anything about it.\n    └── Oh right it ended at 1:45 i forgot\nWeird shit by college"
