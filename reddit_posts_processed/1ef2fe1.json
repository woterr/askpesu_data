More people get higher grades in RR so their cutoffs are a bit higher\n└── So u mean, it's easy to get scholarships in ec campus?\n    ├── Its not easy in any campus, you will still need to work hard. But cutoffs tend to be a bit lower at ECC.\n    │   └── I can get any branch in any of the campuses.. So if it's a bit easier in ecc, then should I prefer that?\n    │       └── As someone else commented, the difference will be marginal. It's upto you, but I'd choose the campus where the subjective parameters align with my interests the most.\n    │           └── Ahh okay man.. I'll be going to rr one.. Coz, it has lesser cutoff than ecc\n    └── Bhai 8.6 ka 8.5 hojayega Zadar se zada\n        └── Aap ec campus mein hoon ya rr me?\n            └── Ec\n                └── Toh vha easy hein, scholarships lene me?\n                    └── Nahi. It's like rr me 8.7 cut off j toh ec me 8.65"
