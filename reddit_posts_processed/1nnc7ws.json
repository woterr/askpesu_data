And anyone right now who were prepping for MS in the US, are y'all still set on that or are you gonna change your goals to a different country or enter/stay the job market.\n\nAlso what's your advice for anyone planning to go abroad.",

Easy to chat with people studying at different programs.\n\nI personally would advise people to explore other countries and have multiple backup plans with the current US situation being what it is. It’s a shitshow right now.\n└── Hey can you share the discord invite?

      "body": "As Nish said, this discussion is better suited for the Study Abroad server. But to summarize: \n\nIf you're studying, you're here on a student visa called the F1 visa. On the F1, you are authorized to work for upto 3 years through the OPT work authorization, which does not cost the employer anything. During the 3 years, you will need to apply for change of status from F1->H1-B, and go under the lottery. If you get picked, your company can sponsor you post the 3 years, else you'll have to pack your bags and leave. Note: There are a lot more details in these sentences, but I'm abstracting it for the average applicant right now.\n\nWe don't have a clear picture of all the details from the announcement yet. We're still waiting for more details to reveal by the end of this week. What we do know is that companies will need to cough up $100k for new H1-B applicants. Whether this applies strictly to people applying directly from outside the US, or also includes people already in the US and needing a change in status, is unknown.\n└── If you don't mind me asking, what are you going to do. I know that you've spent a considerable amount of money to study and live there over the last 2 years\n    └── As I said, the only thing that is guaranteed right now is 3 years of OPT after finishing my Master's. A lottery isn't something that is in my hands, so there's no point worrying about it. If I don't get picked in these 3 years, I'll move back to India, where I'm sure of getting a good job because I know how skilled I am and given my proven work/research experience. So I'll end up returning to India hopefully having cleared most, if not all of the loan I had taken up. \n\nThat's the plan at least for now. Since there are many variables, it's best to just live it one day at a time and maximize your chances at the opportunities that do come your way, than worry about things beyond your control. At least, that's how I like to live my life.\n        └── The last para is low key one of the BEST advices I have heard....thnx buddy always taking ur time out and guiding ur juniors🙏🙏"
