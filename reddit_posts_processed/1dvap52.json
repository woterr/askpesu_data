Here's a bit about me:\n\n* **Non Drinker**\n* **Non Smoker**\n* **Love Peaceful Environment and Silence**\n* **Pure Vegetarian**\n* **Religious**\n* **Upskill (Study) After Office Hours**\n\nI'm looking for like-minded individuals who share similar values. I'm open to either 2 or 3 sharing arrangements, with a budget of ₹10,000 per month.\n\nIf you have any leads or are also looking for a roommate, please feel free to reach out.\n\nThank you!"
