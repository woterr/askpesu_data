So you can expect the price to go lower. \nEC, i don't know.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ 52*\nâ”œâ”€â”€ What about ece? Or specialization?\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Why would u consider management quota :/\nâ”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Health issues, couldnt prepare for boards or jee:(\nâ”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Don't think of it yet, prepare for JEE,BITS session 2 (there's plenty of time). U got this ðŸ˜¼.\n\nI hope u atleast have 75+ in boards.\nâ”‚   â”‚           â””â”€â”€ Still giving boards but idk about the 75\nâ”‚   â”‚               â””â”€â”€ Ahh good luck, put some efforts\nâ”‚   â”‚                   â””â”€â”€ I'm thinking I take up civil/mech in a decent college and learn coding on the side?\nâ”‚   â”‚                       â””â”€â”€ That's hella grind, I am very much against it. \n\nSaying this as I myself left NITK civil, NSUT EE.\n\nGo for ur interests pls, It will pay in the long run.\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ ECE idk, the people I know took CSE only.\nECE should be generally 60% of CSE//\nAiml is 75% of CSE\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ Thank you!\nâ””â”€â”€ They charged approx 7 lakhs more for rr cs over ec cse this year\n    â””â”€â”€ Yeah this looks more in the range, depending on agents and connections. I have seen lots of people getting rr CSE for 40 lakh (no hostel)"
