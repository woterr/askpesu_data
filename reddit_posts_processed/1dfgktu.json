When I joined pes ec cse had a greater cutoff\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ Yep\nHow's the ec campus?\nI saw the rr campus nd it's huge\nâ”‚           â””â”€â”€ Lot fewer buildings but more open space\nâ”‚               â””â”€â”€ Ohh thanks!\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Should I choose cse aiml in pes ec or ise in dsce or cse aiml rr(Pessat)\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Choose PES over DSCE. There is no difference between the campuses so choose the cheaper mode of admission.\nâ”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ Ok thanks!\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ Asking for my friend \nMy friend got 7xx in kcet should he choose pes cs or rvce cs spec\nâ”‚           â””â”€â”€ Both are pretty comparable IMO. RV does have better placements but I don't think it's by much. Pick RVCE only if you think the difference in placements is worth skipping out on core CS.\nâ””â”€â”€ Need help, is dsce that bad? Pes is situated outside the blore right? The campus surrounding is better at dsce ig, does teaching really matter? Is there a really big difference in placement?"

PES CS is much better than these specialisations"

There are people at PES who travel 1.5 hours one-way on a daily basis.\n    â””â”€â”€ also pes through pessat and dsce through kcet"
