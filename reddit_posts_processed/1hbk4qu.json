Far cheaper and easier to get it running on an emulator. Nowadays, its easily possible to run 3DS games on your phone as well (depends on your device, but anything post 2018 runs all Pokemon games smoothly.\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ ðŸ˜‚ haven't u heard of eBay? besides nitendo stopped supporting 3ds recently and you can get it modded tho.\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ Still don't see how eBay is cheaper than running it locally for free using open source emulator software, but sure, you do you. Was just sharing information :)\nâ”‚           â””â”€â”€ ye ye no worries, but emulation doesn't give me that feeling sadly ðŸ˜­..\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Yoo i have bought a 3ds deffo worth it\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ I was gonna buy a switch too but didn't find the poke games(paid) any fun...give ur thoughts i might reconsider to buy a switch xD\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ Save for a Switch 2. But yes - try the Switch games. Some of them like PLA and ScaVio are really good.\nâ””â”€â”€ Wanna team on unite?\n    â””â”€â”€ Sure...YX6KEY9: trainer id"
