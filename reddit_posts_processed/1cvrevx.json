RR vs EC campus: [https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/14anjmd/comment/jobruzy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/14anjmd/comment/jobruzy/)\n└── Thanks bro\n    ├── Yes the placements are pooled but some recruiters give eligibility to only rr students.\n    │   ├── Really? Can u specify the recruiters that have done this\n    │   │   └── Not sure but heard of it\n    │   │       └── Pretty sure it's false\n    │   ├── That's not true. Recruiters don't even know which campus you're from. Make sure you're well informed before making such claims.\n    │   └── I think that's coz of the huge difference in the number of students at RR campus and EC campus. Like one year there were 600 students in RR campus and only 300 in EC campus. So the probability of a student getting selected from rr campus is more than that of a student from ec campus\n    └── Placements are pooled, which means that they take place together for RR and EC students. Recruiters cannot distinguish between students based on campus."
