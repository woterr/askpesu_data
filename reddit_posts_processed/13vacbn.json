I'm gonna be taking Bpharma, how's the scene (placement, faculty)  in EC campus?\n since most of the posts in this subreddit are for Btech.\n2. Does EC campus have a badminton court? \nEvery site I check online seems to say \"indoor sports\" but not mention what they are. Few sites said they have, some said they didn't, it isn't clear on PES official site also. \n3.I'll actually join uh or PES is actually as bad as y'all have been saying",

If you're a professional player, good luck with that court as it is outdoor and you're allowed to only play after 4. That being said a new facility, the MRD Student Centre is due to be opened where there are supposed to be indoor badminton courts.\n└── I see, thankyou"
