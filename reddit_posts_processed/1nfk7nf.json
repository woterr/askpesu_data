Other than that idk\nâ””â”€â”€ Is there any consequences persay\n    â”œâ”€â”€ suspended, shamed and executed by pes ðŸ˜‡, at ur own risk\n    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ nah i need someone who has done this to be realistic\n    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ dont do at first itself, wait for some time before doing this shit, dont create bad impression on teacher, they may hold grudges\n    â”‚           â””â”€â”€ so realistically the biggest issue that can occur is grudges right (in normal situations)\n    â”‚               â””â”€â”€ yes, thats a big issue, even in my pu college teachers held grudges against me cause i was prepping for jee instead of boards, but i got decent marks in exams so luckily they didnt do much\n\nbut here dont take chances yet, dont get blacklisted in teachers eye yrt\n    â””â”€â”€ varies , teachers that are a bit laid back will laugh at you and let you off with a slap on the wrist, but there are teachers who will take this seriously , take you to hod and make a big scene out of it\n        â””â”€â”€ what if my teacher is literally the principal ðŸ˜­"
