Has any senior improved their grades after revaluation or it's just a waste of money as it would cost me 3k as I would only be able to start attending 2nd sem classes after this week so they would charge 2k as fine for being late.",

And they refund 70% of the amount if there’s a change in grade (or at least, they did back then)\n└── But I have paid the ₹1000 fees and I would have to just submit an application to the coe office which can be only done after 12th as I am out of city so would they charge me extra ?\n    └── Ooh I see :/ that’s tricky then. I don’t know. If it’s outside the window of dates they’d opened for reevaluation at 1k then they might ask you pay…hope they accept your application once they see the receipt, though! It’s all up to the COE office"
