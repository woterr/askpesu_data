Its a long comment with multiple linked comments, please go through them.\n\nTLDR - pick the one that best suits what you want to pursue. Pick BITS if you only care about landing the highest-paying job out of undergrad. If you want to study what you are interested in and are passionate about CS, choose PES. The only right decision here is the one which helps you the most.\n└── Thank you man!"
