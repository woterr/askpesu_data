Always (9)\nConsidering you would be analysing them through quant methods assuming equal distance between all the 4 words you have mentioned is something that wouldn't go well if you ever present the work in a journal or conference. \n\nSeems like your variables aren't drawn from the literature but I get the pressure during the final year project.\nCan't fill it myself (not a student), but I shared it with a small group of my students. ðŸ™Œ All the best for the study and do share what you find, really a good problem statement."
