      "body": "i didn't open an account bc i thought i wasn't getting a scholarship- now i have gotten a good enough cgpa and don't know what to do. the union bank acc people at pes weren't there the last 3 to 4 days as well- so what do i do rn??\nâ””â”€â”€ Go to union bank office near college and open a new savings account\n    â””â”€â”€ Hey is opening an account free ? College was asking for 10k from me when I wanted to open\n        â”œâ”€â”€ its free,idk why they asked 10k\n        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ I'm a cet guy. In the pdf they sent for fee it was mentioned\n        â”‚       â””â”€â”€ yes, cet students have to pay 10k to be eligible to get scholarships, 10k isnt fee for opening bank acc\n        â””â”€â”€ It's not for opening the account. For kcet people you have to pay 10k to be eligible for scholarship. Distinction mrd or cnr.\nIt's a one time thing pay in the first sem then applicable for all sems. If you are confident in getting above 7.75 every sem then you can opt for it otherwise it a waste.\n            â””â”€â”€ It isn't a one time thing \nGotta pay every year\nAnd they told us once I opt in I cannot opt out\n                â””â”€â”€ Ah indeed my mistake. Had to consult with a friend. So basically hnless you have confidence of getting 8.5 don't take.\n                    â””â”€â”€ I do have. Just my dad thinks it's stupid and scummy to have to pay for it in the first place, so\n                        â”œâ”€â”€ Itâ€™s a gamble to say the least..\n                        â””â”€â”€ Yup it is stupid and scummy. They'll shame you for it as well sometimes. But don't care too much\n                            â””â”€â”€ Even if you get mrd or cnr scholarship in 1 semester the 10k every year will be recovered so itâ€™s worth going for it"
