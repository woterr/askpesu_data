      "body": "For doing an MBA abroad, the university and CGPA matter partially, but great work experience is crucial. Go to the place with the best placements if doing an MBA later on is what you’re interested in. PESU has always had great placements but I graduated many years ago so can’t really compare against the other 2 colleges today"
