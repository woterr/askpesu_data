SEP 5th or will it be postponed again??\n└── As of now it's 5th sept\n    └── It's fixed ryt or will they be any more delays?\n        └── I donno bro they might delay but 70% I think it'll start for first round batch\n            └── So only first round PPL it's starting. Why not just wait till everything is over..\n                ├── They might wait for second round ppl too who knows..But ig they'll start for first round ppl.. well that's what I feel\n                └── PES doesn't care too much about KCET because the number of PESSAT quota students is >> KCET students. They'll simply create another batch of KCET students that will join in later. Besides, PES tries to wrap up the academic session by June, delays don't help with that\n                    └── Nah dude I'm talking abt pessat 2nd round"
