      "body": "Short answer: No. Specialisations are useless. That certificate is only given to you *after* you graduate. Even then, there is no evidence that it helps. Take electives you are interested in. No company is going to look at what specialisation you have at the end of your 3rd year.\n\nLong answer: search this subreddit.\n└── Specializations dont matter even for MS right? or does it?\n    └── You do not submit it anywhere, so unless you explicitly mention it in your SOP or other materials, it won't be a part of your application. Either way, they already have your transcript, and they are aware of the courses you have taken. That extra paper is meaningless."
