Your friend will need to appear for backlog exams and clear it.\n└── What if he has final isa 40+?\n    ├── Still same, he has to write backlog\n    └── Does not matter. The guideline states that a student has to appear in the ESA to be eligible to pass the course. If they don't show up, it's an auto backlog. \n\nOnce they appear for the ESA, they can get a 0/100 too but still pass because of ISAs, but they have to show up for the exam to be eligible to pass."
