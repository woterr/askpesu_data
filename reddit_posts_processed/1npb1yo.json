  "title": "[Placements] Stop Wasting Placement Slots If You Don’t Even Want Them",
  "content": "Okay guys, placements. I know you’re all sick of hearing about it by now. The process is random as hell, shortlisting feels like dice-roll luck, and honestly it’s exhausting. It’s already September, everyone’s stressed out, and yeah, I’ve faced a couple rejections too. It sucks, but fine that’s part of it.\n\nBut here’s what annoys me: the people with high GPAs (the 8.5+ gang) who *already know* they’re aiming for fat CTCs, still showing up for T2/T1 (12LPA) tests. Like bro, you don’t even want that 10–12 LPA role, then why sit for the OA? Why get shortlisted, ace it (sometimes by copying), and then either ghost the interview or purposely screw it up? For what? You’re literally taking up a spot from someone who actually needs it.\n\nSame thing with internships. Some people just show up, then say “eh it’s just an internship, I’ll bomb the interview.” Why even waste everyone’s time?\n\nPlacements are already tough, man. People are stressed, rejections keep piling up, some of us can’t even sleep properly. The least you can do is not clog the system if you don’t even plan to go through with it.\n\nSo yeah, if you’re in final year and already sitting pretty with a crazy GPA and aiming for only the big ones  do everyone a favor and skip the T2 grind. Let people who actually want those jobs have a fair shot.\n\nDon’t block someone else’s chance just because you’re bored or treating it like practice.\n\nMany people for BT, DTCI did this.",

      "body": "I heard from an insider at a company that when they hire for slightly lower CTC roles (like \\~8 LPA), they intentionally shortlist extra students at PES. They know a good chunk won’t actually accept the offer, so they hedge by taking more people upfront.\n\nCompanies are well aware that if their package is average or below average for the college, a lot of students won’t take it. So they adjust accordingly.\n\nAt the end of the day, you can’t really blame students for writing every test. The real problem is with the placement office and the rules they put in place. Don’t hate the player, hate the game."
