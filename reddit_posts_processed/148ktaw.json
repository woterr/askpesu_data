      "body": "Yeah you can, but you run the risk of losing your seat you want (especially if your rank is near the cutoffs for a branch). Remember that in the second round you will not only have people who didn't get their desired seat in the first round, but also people who didn't get their desired seat in other colleges, people who gave PESSAT as a backup and will come to claim that backup now, and other people like you who will show up only for the second round. It's a gamble, but that's how it is."
