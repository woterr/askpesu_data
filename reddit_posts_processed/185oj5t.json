      "body": "Need a bit more context. Is this for a special topic or an elective? As a rough overview, VLSI subjects are very interconnected and if your basics are weak, you'll struggle a lot. They also have a lot of derivations and they're generally considered to be harder. Signal processing is more of a maths subject. Lots of numericals with a lot of calculus. Also, in the coming sems, if you have a specialisation,(if you choose subjects of the same domain) you might have the first pick of subjects in your domain\n├── Electives\n│   └── If it's for electives and you're not sure, why not take 1 VLSI and 1 communications elective. You'll get a rough idea of the domains and you can plan accordingly and choose whatever you like in the next sems\n└── Ohh okay ill see how fourth sem subjects are maybe it might give an idea. Thank you\n    └── No worries. Good luck!"
