That's also there every weekdays i can just cycle home.\n            └── I am a RR campus hostel kid so can't answer the first part of the question :'(\n                └── What ABT rr campus i am gonna go through kcet, so still didn't fix my college, can I get single bedrooms?\n                    └── For RR \n\nfirst year, you cannot get a single room, but from second year onwards you do get it\n\nIt's called the IH Block\n                        ├── Ohh ok thanks bro..\n                        └── What are the fees for the IH block?"
