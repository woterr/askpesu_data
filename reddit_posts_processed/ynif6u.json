(no offence) just kidding...\n            └── I got the seat in round 1 itself. I’m just kinda disappointed that the cutoffs at pes are dropping\n                └── Agreed👍, many didnt participate in rnd 2, also many chose kcet/jee/neet/vit/iiser... (well, I know many who chose other streams/clgs) this could possibly be the reason. EC campus is kinda isolated to be fair.. If PES had focused on rr as well as EC with equal imp then EC would be a hotspot for engg students.\n                    ├── When I said truly pathetic I meant truly pathetic performance by pes’s management.\n                    └── Yeah..People are still very much unaware about how ec campus actually is and how placements (most ppl's concern) works in pes university!"
