      "body": "yea i also have the same doubt but as the official marksheet isnt available yet ig we'll have to make do with the ones issued on digilocker\nâ”œâ”€â”€ yeah same i also have that only\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ yk what, in the mail it also says that it should be signed by the college authority which ig refers to our school's principal, do you anything about it?\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ summer vacations are going on school is closed ill just bring the printouts hopefully they wont create any issues ðŸ¥²\nâ”‚           â””â”€â”€ ugh ikr same my schools out as well, btw have you got a transfer certificate from your school?\nâ”‚               â”œâ”€â”€ nothing at all i just have my 10th marksheet ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ it also says that ill have to submit the original documents within some stipulated time if not now which would be hectic cause i dont live in karnataka\nâ”‚               â”‚   â””â”€â”€ bro same, can we speak on dms?\nâ”‚               â”‚       â””â”€â”€ yeah sure\nâ”‚               â””â”€â”€ any idea about character certificate? i only have that as of yet\nâ”‚                   â””â”€â”€ um not really, the email doesnt mention that but ig you should carry it\nâ””â”€â”€ It's alright. If I remember correctly they do accept digilocker ones. I remember carrying them for my counseling too. Later when they ask for originals, you can submit them when they're available.\n    â”œâ”€â”€ thank you! also is carrying a transfer certificate absolutely mandatory?\n    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ I don't remember, my counseling was 6 years ago lol. I wouldn't suggest bringing more documents than necessary. They are usually precise with the documents you need to carry.\n    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ the email regarding the counseling says to carry it if applicable but my schools out for summer vacay so theres no way i can get mine on time\n    â”‚           â””â”€â”€ It's fine, don't stress it then. Most kids don't have all the originals during counseling. Submit copies of whatever you have for now, and later submit the originals.\n    â”‚               â””â”€â”€ thank you so much!\n    â””â”€â”€ If I plan on rejecting the seat, do I have to bring the DDS and the necessary documents?\n        â””â”€â”€ I think they check for documents before letting you in\n            â””â”€â”€ Thank you, will I be allowed to attend the second round of counseling if I don't attend the first round?\n                â””â”€â”€ Yes you can. Although I would not recommend that.\n                    â””â”€â”€ Thank you. Why not?\n                        â””â”€â”€ Answered here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/1cxq14v/comment/l54ifi3/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/1cxq14v/comment/l54ifi3/)\n\nCheck the part about round 2."
