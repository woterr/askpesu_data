      "body": "Regarding which branch you can get with your rank, check the previous year cutoffs. \n\nCounseling usually takes place as follows (long comment so it can be added to FAQs): \n\n1. Everyone shows up to counseling and registers themselves at the front desk, so PES knows which ranks have shown up on that day. This removes all the ranked kids that did not show up.\n2. As counseling starts, all ranks are called out one by one. So it starts with the first rank that showed up, and then the next, and so on. \n3. There's a big screen that also shows stats like the total number of seats in a branch and the last rank that took the seat, among other metrics.\n4. If your rank is called, you head over to the system, choose a branch from any of the ones that have seats and confirm it. This also decrements the seat count for the chosen branch. The person at the system hands you a token. If you do not like any of the branches, you can choose to not take anything and leave. \n5. You take the token to the financial counters at the side and make the deposit amount for that branch (10k + first year fees) via the DDs you've carried. They take a bit of time to activate everything and once that is done they give you a bunch of receipts, maybe ask you to sign some documents and then hand you some merch like water bottles and tshirts. \n6. Once the previous step is done, you've essentially been registered into the system and your admission is complete. You should be able to access the student portal after this and complete the remaining admission related tasks. \n\nThe second round of counseling works exactly like the first round, except for a few important things: \n\n1. There are usually extremely few seats in round 2. You should not skip round 1 and directly come to round 2 unless you have an extremely good rank (<200), since there are usually at most a handful in every branch. If you don't get a seat in round 1, you will 70% not get the seat in round 2. \n2. You don't need to give up your round 1 seat before round 2. If you've chosen branch X in round 1, and then you choose another branch Y in round 2, they'll simply switch your registration details and initiate a refund or ask for more money for the difference in fees when you head to the financial counters with your token. \n3. However, if you choose a branch in round 1, and don't like any options in round 2, you cannot give up the seat you have during the second round. You'll need to initiate a refund request and you will be charged atleast 10k. \n4. The second round of counseling works exactly like the first, so there is no preference given to you if you came for the first round. They will start with the first rank that shows up on that day. So if you have a rank ~500, you'll still need to wait for all the kids with a lower rank than you to finish their selection before you get to make yours.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Man I donâ€™t know who you are but seriously all the stuff youâ€™ve done thanks a lot man I mean it with all my heart ðŸ¥¹ðŸ¥¹\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ ![gif](giphy|l0NwGpoOVLTAyUJSo|downsized)\nâ”œâ”€â”€ hey dude can i dm you abt some doubts regarding fees?\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Sure, although you can just post your question here as well.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ hey what is the policy on refund of the fees if we dont take admission. I am still deciding which college to take but dont want to leave pes cs. so if i pay the dds on day of admission will they give it back if i dont take admissions in the college later?\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ 10k cannot be refunded if you take up a seat. The remaining amount depends on how late you ask for a refund. If it is before classes begin, they usually refund the entire amount. Otherwise, they charge a certain % of fees for each day of class you attend.\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ oh thanks\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Is it mandatory to have 60% aggregate in PCM to participate in the councelling or will they relax it.\nâ””â”€â”€ Rowlet bro, I have 2.3k in pessat and have Cs in ec campus. If in second round, I don't get RR aiml , what will happen- can we just leave in between and still keep the Cs ec campus seat without paying anything in that counseling? keeping in mind the 3rd point that My seat can't be surrounded after that."

There will call ranks starting from 1 if they have registered for the process. When your rank comes you get to choose from the remaining seats available, if you give the DD, your seat is confirmed. The number of seats remaining and all other details will be screened in the auditorium.\nâ””â”€â”€ Gotcha man thanks a ton\n    â””â”€â”€ And do you feel I should give up my vit seat in preference to this. Iâ€™m paying cat 4 fees in vellore and well was just wondering abt which college is better?\n        â””â”€â”€ Because I have until Friday to pay the remaining balance of the vit fees and well my parents were just wondering what to do they are ok to pay both but still were wondering"
