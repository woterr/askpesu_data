      "body": "EEE in rr and ECE in ec(if lucky) is prolly what u can get unless you get very lucky and many don't accept the seat or smth ? You can refer to last years cutoffs, they shouldn't change too much compared to last year maybe +/- 200 rank\n└── Ive heard a couple people saying you usually get ece within 5k rank though and that this time the seats have increased or something??\n    └── 5k is for EC included but that also is a stretch. Even I was wondering about the seats increased thing but someone told me it's just a total seats increase due to the addition of AIML branch in pesu ec campus so that's where the extra seats are. Cuz if u look at 2023 seat matrix(no. of seats for each category) it's the same as previous years but aiml is added with 288 seats r smth."
