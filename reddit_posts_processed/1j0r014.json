Do u even know about biotech? Also eee? Are u sure u can do core?\n    â”‚           â””â”€â”€ calm down man they make you choose 9ðŸ˜­. If it were up to me i would have opted only for cs\n    â”œâ”€â”€ How much for cse at ec campus and rr campus??\n    â””â”€â”€ its damn fucked up my friend who got 90%tile got cs in ec campus. I had called them and i dont think they found my applicationðŸ’€. Anyways they asked me to send a mail and i did so ig we will see what happens\n        â””â”€â”€ PES is new to online counselling... so maybe they messed it up..."

But what kinda bs is this that i dont get cs ec just cause its my third choice compared to someone's first choice when i clearly have 2-3 %ile more than them.\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ in the website it mentions that the preference order has no bearing in seat assignment so its not that fs they probably just messed something up\nâ””â”€â”€ LMFAOOO GOT THE SAME MSG AT 94.3%TILE. PES is just a hater fr lmfaoooo\n    â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ did you try connecting w them? cause ive seen a couple of people who've gotten much lower get in\n    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ye i called them and they asked me to mail it to them and i did. I am waiting to hear back but honestly i dont have much hope left\n    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ any updates?\n    â”‚           â””â”€â”€ nope\n    â”œâ”€â”€ i got the same msg at 95.5xx\n    â””â”€â”€ same message at 94.2 as well they fr playing with us lmao"

If an engineering college can't do even this much is it even worth it!\nâ”œâ”€â”€ exactly. i still dont understand how is it justified to give a seat to the ones who have got around 90-92 but not to the the people who have scored 94-95ish??\nâ””â”€â”€ Maybe they are considering other factors like state residence, 10th marks etc in addition to jee percentile?"
