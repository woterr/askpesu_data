      "body": "This varies from individual to individual but personally I found chem cycle easier (my sgpa increased by 0.23)\n\nIt's because I found chem easier than phy (this is common for most people, atleast for my batch). I was also extremely bad at mechanical in phy cycle. At the end of the day it depends on which subjects you find easier."

I personally felt math was the same difficulty in both sems. \n\nchem gpa: 9.82\nphys gpa: 9.95\n└── unreal gpa"
