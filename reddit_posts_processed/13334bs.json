I'm having second doubts just from the crowd size 💀\n│   ├── its gonna be overcroded af, source is pretty much college website\n│   └── Crowd zyada hai, ik ppl from pes\n├── Is it really true that more cse seats are getting added?\n└── They won't be doubling this year, originally they were going to shift all EC campus seats to RR and stop BTech in EC but I guess GJB construction progress is slower than they expected so it's postponed(you can check intake of courses on [pes.edu](https://pes.edu) it is back to 720 now)."
