It's not my choice at all, but they've been bugging me to check this\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ im pretty sure you can get into a good nit with that percentile. pes is not worth paying 4.5 lakh for, so keep it as your last option.\nâ”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Yes yes! I'm still trying to improve my score in JEE Mains Session 2, and then BITS and Advanced etc. We'll see, but according to my parents \"PES is a safe option\" hence the application. Thank you though! Much Appreciated\nâ”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ np. all the best.\nâ”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ that hurts to hear, where did she end up going?\nâ”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ PES e city lmao. she got a good enough kcet rank for RR but her parents did let her go there either.\nâ”‚   â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ iiitb is in ecity as well... or did they not want her to go to an hostel?\nâ”‚   â”‚   â”‚           â””â”€â”€ they didn't want her to \"mingle with boys\" and IIITB would have more guys obv\nâ”‚   â”‚   â”‚               â””â”€â”€ it genuinely pains me to hear this, I hope shes doing okay now\nâ”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ wait what\n\nmy parents are sorta like that, and I told them I got cse at pes ecity ðŸ¥¹\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Yeah I mean if u got 98-97 would make sense to apply to pes as a back up but at 99.6 ur bound to get good seats in nits and iiits.\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ He can get IIIT bangalore cse with that i think\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Are you a PES student?\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ yes\nâ””â”€â”€ I saw 99.6 and I was like wit this competition where tf do i get a seat"
