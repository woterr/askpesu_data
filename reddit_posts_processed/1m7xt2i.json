Windows can generally run most programs pretty reliably well and sometimes you might need some niche ahh software that can only run on windows. Plus if you wanna play games, I'd recommend windows.\n\nBut if you just want ease of use and carry then mac is good\n                                └── That's the reason i have still not bought one because i don't know what programs i will be using. i am a CS student i have heard that people mostly have problem running a software MATLAB . If  any of the senior's share there experience of using mac than it would be great . We already have one pros and cons  but a user experience review in detail would be great"
