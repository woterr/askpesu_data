Are pes people dumbb?ðŸ˜­\n        â”œâ”€â”€ Iirc pes ecity was vtu affiliated until some 2019 or 2020. Then it became autonomous. While one in rr was always autonomous.\n\n\nHow does kea even decide cutoffs for that matter? Always was curious\n\n\nBtwÂ did u know there's a pes mandya?\n        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€  I'm not talking about the kcet cutoffs.. I saw a post in which some wrote a cmnt saying, rr aiml had a cgpa cutoff of 8.6 whereas ec cse had a cg cutoff of 8.1 for branch change..\n        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pes mandya and this pes isn't related lol\n        â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Ohh.\nThat's weird asf ngl, I expected them to like release some cutoff lost based on some ranking or smth\n        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Is mandya pes good ?? I got it through kcet now should I join ???\n        â””â”€â”€ Check the FAQs\n            â””â”€â”€ Rowlet anna, new dp looks amazing.. \n\nBtw,  I've already read every faq present in this sub ..\n                â””â”€â”€ Thanks, my friend drew it :) - all credit goes to her.\n                    â””â”€â”€ Girl friend?\n                        â”œâ”€â”€ No, just friend. \n\nRR tends to have slightly higher cutoffs. More people want to shift to RR for some reason so the cutoff increases.\n                        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ You aren't getting her hints, no friend puts efforts in drawing things for free.. Hope you understand this\n                        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ the reason this year was timetable , CIE(main reason) and same course with a better campus + opportunity ...  \nMany from CSE ECC went to RR AIML ....... just cuz of campus\n                        â””â”€â”€ This has been answered in a previous post by rowlet, check the faqs"
