For one thing, these are best 4 out of 5, so if you do well enough going forward, it will nullify your current marks.\n\nThe other thing that is possibly the *only* good thing about the 5 ISA system is that it significantly reduces the impact that any one ISA has on your GPA. Don't sweat it, analyze where you messed up, and don't be hard on yourself!  \n\n\nAll the best :)\nâ””â”€â”€ Thnx"
