But recently they said that it will be reduced to four credit and the other two were considered as extra credits.\n\nIg they have a limit of summer course now or something . Not sure about this fact tho.\n        â””â”€â”€ In case i dont the summer course and i didnt take special topic in 3rd sem , will it be fine and easy for me to cover the remaining credits required/\n            â””â”€â”€ Itâ€™ll be more stressful next year cause youâ€™ll need this summer break for a bit of placement preparation or a good cv building internship.. so try doing something thatâ€™s adding to either your cv or credits even in this holiday. If you arenâ€™t doing an internship I would definitely suggest to do atleast one summer course. See I guess you can do 2 but 3 will be a stretch cause idk if Pes will have those many courses stretched out. Generally, itâ€™s like there are different options, but all of it happens during the same Two weeks.but definitely go for summer course cause you didnâ€™t do special topic also try removing burden from next year youâ€™ll get busy with capstone also next summer\n                â”œâ”€â”€ Thx a lot Iâ€™ll definitely take the summer course\n                â”‚   â””â”€â”€ I hope you enjoy it! Itâ€™s just a week and mostly esa will be a project or super easy trust me with friends itâ€™ll go by very quick!:)\n                â””â”€â”€ Is each course 1 or 2 credits\n                    â””â”€â”€ 2 credits"
