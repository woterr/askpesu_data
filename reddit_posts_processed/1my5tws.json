I live in indiranagar which option would be better for me as option entry closes on Monday at 1 pm. It takes me 1 hr 15 mins to reach PES EC Campus via metro whereas It takes me only 12 mins to reach UVCE via metro. I cannot decide whether I should give up my comfort for a better college or just take UVCE and play it safe.Pls guide",

Is it because I will not be getting time to development op  my skills?\n    └── Your days will be hectic and yes u would be too lazy to work or study after coming home cause being consistent is key and remember u r spending 4years there and pes syllabus is hard and ofc pes has an edge compared to Uvce in terms of infra peer grp coding culture  but at the end of the day it's upon u  urself companies come in both the clgs  and select the top ones .\n        └── Is if college gets over at e3 30 I will be back home by 4 30 and even if I start studying at 7 will I be fine cuz in UVCE the infra and dteachers are bad"
