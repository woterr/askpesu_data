I'm not sure which college you'll get via ComedK though"

Also there is a high probability that i might get aiml in rr campus\n            â””â”€â”€ Don't know about cut off it increased by some 400 for rr campus CSE in second round.\nAiML you'll definately get as last time it was 1900 in second round.\nBut core is always better than specialization.\nSo consider joining ec campus CSE then joining rr campus CSE with AiML\n                â””â”€â”€ Nah man i didnt like the ec campus i'll stay with rr campus\n                    â””â”€â”€ Lol fine, then you'll get AiML definately"
