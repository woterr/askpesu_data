Are they ? Your engineering rank depicts the marks you scored in pcm so what's the difference if they consider pcm marks or engineering rank?"

I thought they only released jee one??\n└── Nah they’ll release on 14th\n    └── So like how we had counselling for jee today, we'll have one for kcet too? not through the kea counselling and stuff?\n        ├── Yes\n        └── Please don’t register for that also\n            └── isn't kcet fees way lesser than mains one tho\n                └── Nah it’s the same fee go actually see the application form\n                    └── Uh no? The ceo person giving speech today himself said that if we get seat through kcet they'll refund the money?"
