But now, after talking to older students, I'm hearing it's more like 45-50%. Plus, the 2029 class is gonna be huge, like 3500 students, and they're even adding more AI seats this year! It's gonna be a disaster.\n\nThis whole AI boom, the huge intake, and the IT market situation are seriously scaring me.\n\nI'm not sleeping well after investing 28 lakhs, especially since we're a middle-class family.\n├── Chill, your still in 1st year, u have plenty of time to prepare.\n└── Bro I'll seriously suggest you to get pretty good at Competitive Programming and leave the cheaters and other folks behind in the summer internship cycle itself. Competition doesn't matter when you're that good. For summer internship, they won't even look at ur resume much (sometimes gender) that' all\n    ├── What resources to prep for that? \nIs dsa a2z striver sheet enough? And regular cf?\n    │   └── Striver's a2z is a big mountain to climb in itself, but you have to go beyond that. Learn from a2z fully and properly then jump to CF\n    └── Or maybe learn to cheat properly during the summer internship season also along with being damn good at dsa\n        └── Yeah seeing the current scenario, just being good enough to impress a boomer interviewer can also get you through but getting selected after OA is the main hurdle apart from diversity hiring\n            └── I don't think there is anything bad in cheating if u have the knowledge and confidence to clear the interview "

They will soon start bringing in WITCH companies to mass hire for future batches to compensate for the increased number of students.\n├── Vit placements are far better than pes this year atleast they are getting placed no matter in mass recruitment pes doesn't give that privilege too last year only 51 students placed in tier 3 companies\n│   └── Mass recruitment companies are usually discouraged from entering PES because they know not a lot will apply or join them. This also explains why VIT's average and median are much worse than ours.
