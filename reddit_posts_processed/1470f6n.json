I can't seem to find the latest curriculum copy in their webiste. I emailed the admissions and they asked me to visit the campus.   \nDoes anyone have a softcopy of the curriculum ?   \nThanks!",

However in all probability it's the rebranded MIDS (Machine Intelligence and Data Science) specialisation that used to exist. \n\nIf you want the latest syllabus for that, you can join the main PESU discord server and ask the current thurs years for the most updated coursework.\n└── Thanks, I'll check out the discord group."
