Think twice before you defend a corrupt institution\n├── exactly this! it’s shocking to see the comments, the  main thing I asked was for spreading awareness and talk about it, but people just wanna say i’m ruining the name of PES, the least we can do is spread more awareness, all these people care about it “the suicide didn’t happen on campus so it’s not colleges problem it’s her, like get a life and be more sympathetic y’all.\n└── Held back?
