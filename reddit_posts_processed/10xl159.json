Since there aren't \\_exact\\_ guidelines about this, it's unlikely that anyone on the subreddit will have proper information about college's approach to this, and in case things go south later, you're better off getting a guarantee from the official coordinator so you can at least raise a complaint with the Pro-Chancellor if necessary\n└── Okay\n    └── What response did you get from internship coordinator?"
