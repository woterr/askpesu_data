Also it was so funny seeing everyone clap as soon as cse ec became 0. It was a legit auction house there lol.\n            └── Ohh haha, so can I only join the second round of counseling if I didnt join the first. Also will cse seats be available in the second round?\n                └── High chance as many will leave seats for cet/comedk/manipal etc especially the top rankers. But it will be Ec only as rr the first few will take cse if seats r left so difficult to get from below 2.5k rank"
