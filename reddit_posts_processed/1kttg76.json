But nothing more. But then, you wouldn't be paying 5L+/year for that unless you are *extremely* well off.\n            â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Rvce>Manipal>Pes>Comedk colleges\nIs this a correct ranking?\n            â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ The top 3 do not have much difference among them, but yeah I guess you could say that is fairly accurate. Its been a while since I went through this process, so I am not the right person to answer.\n            â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ It really doesn't matter much. \n\nI'd say rvce=manippal=pes=remaining 2-3 top comedk colleges(bms, msrit, maybe another I'm missing) >the rest of the comedk colleges. \n\nMost colleges in the same \"tier\" will give you roughly the same opportunities. It really depends on the students themselves after that.\n            â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ where would u keep thapar ? in same tier or below ? bcz im getting a seat at thapar in ECE and idk if i will get ECE here\n            â”‚   â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Same\n            â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ placement wise yes but if u want more college life then manipal>pes>rv ( as what i have seen)\n            â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Pes is still better than most colleges in banglore right.. Like top 3 in banglore\n            â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Other than rvce and iiitb \nPes is way better than the rest. \nThe gap btw rvce and pes is not that much now.\n            â””â”€â”€ Could you share?"

If you were trying to post anything else, then DM the mods.\n    â””â”€â”€ Mod is the office close today ? They did a glitch with my rank because of which the ranking given by pesu is affected. They're not responding on mail and not picking calls\n        â””â”€â”€ Not sure. Try calling them if you haven't emailed yet, or if you live in Bangalore, visit the campus and get it sorted. Someone else also spoke about a glitch in another thread.\n            â”œâ”€â”€ There is an option to change rank but I'm not sure was it yesterday too, and if I do that will they release a new ranklist\n\nI have emailed them yesterday as well as a follow up today no response and I'm not from karnataka\n            â””â”€â”€ Bro please check my recent post"
