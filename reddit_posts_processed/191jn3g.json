      "body": "It depends on ur preferences.\nI found the faculty to be great. The building is okish (engineering department is in a single block). Campus is huge. The crowd here is awesome. You get to learn in a competitive environment. U get to meet amazing seniors, who always want to help you. Club activities are frequent. \n\nEvery place u go is overcrowded. Be it any of the canteens, mrd block, etc. I didn't quite like the infrastructure here. Broken lab equipment and stuff. You get to see vintage keyboards and mouses in the computer lab here. Management here, is very strict (ofcourse it's PES ðŸ¤¡). Timings are awful for first years.\n\n\nNote: The opinions stated above are in regards to PES University EC campus."
