  "content": "As stated previously, this is the first year since PES removed it's PESSAT admission test and included only JEE and KCET scores. No current student or graduate will have enough information to answer which branch you can get with x% given that the pool of seats for JEE has increased, we're looking at completely new demographics applying from this year and the range of applicant scores has increased: past data is now obsolete for making predictions. \n\nPES is also not transparent with the new admission process and most current students (and especially graduates) don't really bother knowing the intricate details once they're in (or out). So almost everyone here is uninformed and there is quite a bit of missing information and insights. \n\nTo summarise, there are simply no data points to offer helpful suggestions. We cannot help you besides answering about PES. If you have any admission-related questions, they're best directed towards the admission department. \n\nAny future posts on this topic will be promptly deleted. If you see any such post, please report it to the mods.\n\n\n",
