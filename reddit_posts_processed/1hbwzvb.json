Although you should know that each attempt is not free.\n├── I heard that if you fail a backlog paper 3 times they will rusticate you(please take it with a fistful of salt)\n│   └── There is no such rule. Best to not spread misinformation.\n│       └── Which is why I added the last part. Thanks for clarifying 🙏\n└── I _think_ u can do it only up to 4 times, more than that means ur degree will be nullified\n    └── No, you can write any number of times.\n\nBut a fact that many students miss is that your internals are not counted, so you have to pass in the esa itself, ie esa is given 100% weightage\n        └── Who told u as many times u can write ?"
