All answer scripts are scanned and then sent to the profs who correct, and the bubbling is basically used to map that sheet as part of your answer. If you don't bubble, that sheet isn't going to be part of your answer at all so they won't even see it\n└── But because its the first ISA, they might consider\n    ├── They scan the answer sheets and the software reads the bubbles and then uploads that answer for that respective question all by itself. People who scan have no other job than scanning and moving on to the next paper\n    │   └── +1\n\nThere's no 'sympathy' option in that software.The last thing u can do is to go and talk to people in COE or Get advice from your mentor.\n    ├── Unfortunately the system doesn't work like that. Nobody is manually deciding which pages are scanned and registered. Every page goes through the scanner and if there is no bubbling, it gets skipped.\n    └── How can they consider it if it doesn't even get scanned\n        └── They will scan all the sheets...?! 😂"

But they didn't update that when they gave results for the first time I got it after reval results, they really forget u have to go to the exam block and keep reminding them I went like 3 times they won't scold or anything don't worry. they will schedule reval for everyone.\n└── Bro I have bubbled all the sheets except 1 sheet (that's what I strongly believe). So basically I'm not sure if I bubbled a sheet that contains 4 marks. Can I give the letter before revaluation but after the first round of evaluation? So that I can give the letter after confirming if I've bubbled it or not.\n    └── Yeah if u give letter now only they'll valuate it don't wait for reval, if u don't get marks even after results then go and tell them again they'll valuate it and update ur marks\n        └── Okayy thank you for replying"
