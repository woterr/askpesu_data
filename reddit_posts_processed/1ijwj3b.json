Details about backlog exams are in FAQs.\n├── I have not gotten the option to see the paper yet or apply for re eval , and is there any chance of grade curve?\n│   └── You'll get details about applying for re-evaluation in a few days (2-3 usually). There will be a form you need to fill up with more details. \n\nAnd no, your current grade will be your final grade if you don't apply for re-evaluation. The grade you have now is after all adjustments have been made to the grade mapping.\n│       └── Oh understood thanks a lot for the help\n└── btw do they tell us if they did use relative grading for the score?  \nbecause on the site it does not talk about relative grading or anything right now.\n    └── Your grade sheet *may* include it. It won't be on the website"
