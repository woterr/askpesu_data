      "body": "Manipal is way Cooler and Better than PES. IT is anyday a better branch than AIML coz it is general not narrow. Manipal is totally worth it. But if u r getting PES through KCET with 4 Lakhs Total Fees of the Degree then I think u shld rethink as Manipal is more costly. But if u r getting PES through PESSAT then don't waste 16 lakhs for nothing. Better to pay little extra and get the Bang for your Buck in Manipal rather then PES through PESSAT.\n└── Hey I got pes thru pessat so fees is almost same,  manipal hostels are cheaper\n    ├── Then don't even think about PES. Go to Manipal without any second thought.\n    └── Also IT is a much better Branch than AIML coz it is general and not narrow.\n        └── Thanks a lot , the crowd quality in manipal seems better has most of them have cleared at least JEE mains\n            └── Crowd Quality at Manipal will be significantly better because they take in Much Lesser people than PES which takes 1600."
