The time slots are usually 1-1.5hrs long.\nIf you go to the gym anytime before 4 pm, there are no time slots, and you could just stay in gym till 4 pm if you want.\nFor a hostelite it's pretty chill if you r willing to work out early in the morning \nFor day scholars it could be a little bit of a struggle if you don't live nearby\n        ├── Yeah it's better if I join near my house.\n        └── What about in the mornings?\n            └── There are no time slots in the morning"

Only 45 people are allowed in batches of 75 mins and it is practically impossible to get in the evening 5-7 batches.\n└── I think it'd be better for me to join cult.\n    └── PESU gym is really beneficial if you a hostel student otherwise you better off working out in the gym near your home. Although I prefer non-cult gyms, cult gyms have gone down in maintenance and are overcrowded always."

There is a gym fee which you have to pay to the sports department after which they will give you a card containing your gym membership details. The fee payment is 10k for a year... And you'll have to show the card every time you want to enter the gym, so make sure not to lose it\n└── Does the sports department charge for using the other facilities too? \nLike the basketball court."
