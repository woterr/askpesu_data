Cuz I saw some ppl at the admissions\n        └── Yeah, I'm guessing Thursday was for completing admissions of all students except engineering\n            └── I saw some ppl at admissions when I went to the campus on Friday…so I’m guessing there were multiple installments of admissions\n                └── Yeah there are different time slots per day as well"
