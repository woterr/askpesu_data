Please stay away from me irl. If I see you anywhere. I will put something in your ass so hard it will come out of your mouth and you'll taste your own shit.\n\nDon't trivialise the loss of lives. I know shit happens a lot in IITs and IIMs and all. But that doesn't mean you can justify what's happening at PES with this argument. We are using our brains. We are engineering students. Yes this sort of stuff happens. But the inhumane way the management brushes all these deaths under the carpet. Is scary. No way people will be not worried or scared.\n\nImagine your friend. Or a roommate. He commits suicide due to excess pressure from the college or in some other way the college can't be put blame on directly. The institute will ALWAYS come out and say it's not our fault. I get that, I am not dumb.\nBut think about his parents. His close ones. They'll always. ALWAYS be bitter with the college.\n\nEvery college does this and every college is bad. Doesn't nullify the deeds of PES management or justify them. The frequency with which untoward incidents are occurring, and the alacrity with which the management acts  is alarming to say the least.\n\nAnd if you are an alt for one the management of PES.\nPlease bros. Please, revaluate how you teach things. How evaluate students. What sort of pressure you are putting on them. Also please look into Mech HOD. Please.\n    ├── I genuinely Understand what you say\n    ├── The management themselves have told that it's a bit difficult to manage each and everyone In a Big College I have heard it actually\n    │   └── The they should keep a manageable batch size instead of cashing in on every single trend and making it a branch\n    └── The way they evaluate students in Examination is not bad I have asked students in other Colleges also like VTU Colleges they told they evaluate the same strict way. Like it's Common in All Colleges.\n        └── Okay boss you seem pretty convinced. PES is the best college in the world and they can't do anything wrong.\nAgreed 🤝\n            └── The amount of comments he has made here defending the college is kind of insane 😭😭"
