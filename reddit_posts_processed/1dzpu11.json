If I remember its around 1300 now. Well its still cheaper being through CET/ComedK so I'd say BMSCE still over MSRIT.\n        └── except that PESU is able to attract so many companies whereas BMSCE struggled to get 900+ offers (according to their website)  \nWhat? He's getting both through COMEDK lol, so idk what the last part of your sentence implies\n            └── so um pes ec would be better right?\n                └── im not gonna say anything about that cuz i havent been in pesu (ec) for more than 1.5 months  \nbut between bmsce cse and msrit cse, i personally think its better to choose the latter, from this year onwards as you would have to compete with only about 540 students in msrit (cse and group) whereas with about 1400 students in bmsce (cse and group)"

But bms is probably equivalent. \n\nOf these three just take one depending on fee, location, and infrastructure\n\nPes ec cs,\nBms cs,\nPes rr aiml\n\nMostly not much difference\n    └── Just an update: Wouldn't recommend BMSCE anymore, as they have about 900 seats for core CSE now and 300 seats for AIML whereas MSRIT has only about 220 for CSE core."

So pes ec campus is probably best option\n├── nope I'm more into academics tbh\n│   └── Yep then pes ec campus if transport not an issue or else take rr campus aiml\n└── Is placements same for PES RR and PES EC campus? I mean if a company visit PES RR, then will the PES EC campus students be eligible?\n    └── Yes yes, both can sit for same company"
