  "content": "4th Sem Summer Internship\nRAPID involves creating an AIML based project and if I do join ISFCR ,we'll be working in the Automotive Cybersecurity domain.\nI'm confused as to what I should choose. I have none to basic knowledge in both of these domains. \n\nIt would be really helpful if someone who's interned in either of these,or knows people who have,could share their experience/ pros and cons.\n",

      "body": "See, all ISFCR does is give fancy domains names, you will end up doing everything on your own, finding novelty, researching, building. It’s justifiable only if your guide is good enough to mentor/ guide your throughout coz end of the day their name will also be in the research paper you write. Hence my honest advice do a background check on the guide, see if the domain is within your interests, then decide.\n└── I was a Core member of ISFCR I second this.\n\nBut it benefited me a lot self learning things is most important aspect which “Good Companies” look for Im glad that I was part of it I researched myself the only inputs I got was if I could do any better that made me push myself and I’m very happy at my current role where that talent was recognised"
