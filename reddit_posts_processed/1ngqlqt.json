  "content": "So the Chancellor and Vice Chancellor recently addressed the cheating going on during the orientation for 3rd years, saying something along the lines of, “Companies have told us about the cheating that’s happening, and we had to put our heads down.”\n\nThey also said they’re going to come down hard on cheaters. Do you all think they’ll actually follow through on their words?",

Different companies come with different proctoring service providers and all have different issues.\n└── Why can't they use the systems used for isa/esa?\n    └── They do for many OAs but many at times there is a conflict with the OA and isa / esa schedule"

I remember for Commvault test last year there was strict attendance taken and the link was only sent to those present in the assessment centre and also there were many ppl from the company like 15-20 people to invigilate in every room. I can guarantee that it would have been impossible to cheat in that OA. If the company is willing to invest resources to stop cheating they can, but most companies want the invigilation to be done by the college which is going to be strictly enforced.\n    ├── Yeah that's the reality; And with so much crowd like around 1000 people attending OA, it is impossible for companies or clg to monitor it, so cheating is possible in clg as well\n    └── nah man, my friend wrote it from home and got shortlisted for the interview too."
