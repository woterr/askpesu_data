  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nThis post is intended to serve as a central reference for the placement statistics across different years. Note that these are **unofficial** **resources maintained by students**, but I believe these are fairly accurate since they almost always match with PESU's yearly placement report.\n\nI've compiled the links below so that prospective students and anyone else interested can easily access this information in one place. If you have anything to contribute to this post, DM me, and I will add it.\n\n> ⚠️ **This post is NOT** **meant for conversations on placements, and only serves** **as an announcement board**.\n\n# CSE\n\n* [2025](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SnSNM_GnuTwIJ0oI3bHt9nAnDQXfqwIhT8JHEwq727g) (updated); also see: [2025](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TfR17y3iPGzHFmCfWGwAXBpwCHvbxEK0wOP_Kx8FOG8/edit?usp=drivesdk) (outdated/unmaintained)\n* [2024](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YZ7HtUcvA9jqWZ04DuwTT66aTV7gU7DUlXyO2BewpII/edit?usp=drivesdk)\n* [2023](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a-eaEBcTeOJESck3f8W_I3uJqRRiEc_7d5O1Xc3nIUg/edit?usp=drivesdk)\n* [2022](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/18BzbVvG80LRJ5p2jQdZ446IqL8rUbaEyrGxpOnW2PBY/htmlview#)\n\n# ECE\n\n* [2025](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GN0hXmrWHRGo75Y9vAlBFVkdVYi0lXYoLAncGVhW7CY/edit?usp=sharing)",
