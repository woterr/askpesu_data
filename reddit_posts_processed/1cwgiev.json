      "body": "CSE, ai ml u wont have an option to choose many electives, cse gives u broad scope.\nâ””â”€â”€ So in CSE, will I get the basic knowledge of AI?\n    â””â”€â”€ Yes, u can take AI ML electives and gain the same knowledge as AI ML peeps. Ngl but all these specializations are scams. They just limited the number of electives u can take, they don't provide you any specialized knowledge for your domain. I'm into bioinfo and was checking out a clg offering cse with bioinfo, they just threw in some molecular biology, biochemistry and bioinformatics subjects from the biotech curriculum, it didnt really help u gain specialized knowledge. If u wanna specialize in AI and ML go for masters in it after bachelors.\n        â””â”€â”€ Okay got it, so they are basically doing this to mainly attract more students as everyone's mad about AI nowadays\n            â””â”€â”€ Yeah that's whats happening, actually, PES isn't the worst lol. Places like VIT and even smaller colleges have waaay too many cse options with no real added value.\n                â””â”€â”€ True, Vit is just ðŸ¤¡"
