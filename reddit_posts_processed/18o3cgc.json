You'll have to clear all your backlogs if you want to be eligible for placements (and your degree) though.\nâ””â”€â”€ Which batch are u from?\n    â””â”€â”€ I graduated in 2022"

If your backlogs have over 24 credits, then you won't be going to tje next semester and would have to wait until the next semester's ESA. 3rd sem I think has 22 credits in total + a 2 credit special topic. That's right on the edge of 24 credits but I don't think you'd fail in all of them bro, hope for the best ðŸ¤ž\nâ””â”€â”€ Wait so if i do get them , then i will have to wait till next sem and will start fourth sem when my peers are in fifth sem?\n    â””â”€â”€ yes afaik"
