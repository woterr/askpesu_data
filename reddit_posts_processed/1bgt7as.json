Didn't know about that\n\nDo you think the cutoff for AIML will be higher than CSE this year?\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ For general, you need around 1800 according to last year cutoff, to get aiml at rr..\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ Where'd you get that rank from, because according to the picture  attached to the post it shows like 4000 or somthing\nâ”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ Please review the general category for the cutoffs in the attached image, as the ones shown are for other categories.\nâ”‚           â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Ah alright my dumbass thinking 1G was the general category, my bad\nâ”‚           â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Lol, K\n\nWith the increased number of seats (literally doubled), I believe the cutoff is going to decrease.\nâ”‚           â”‚           â””â”€â”€ Yeah I know the placements are pooled but I think RR is just slightly better when it comes to college life and Hackathons/clubs (according to my seniors)\nâ”‚           â”‚               â””â”€â”€ There is an RR vs EC campus comparison post in the FAQ: https://bit.ly/pesu-faq\nâ”‚           â””â”€â”€ It's not GM.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Hey has the seats for pessat also doubled from this year ??\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Yes!!\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Im 2026 batch, ours was 720 for cs and ~200 for aiml. What is it now?\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Btw I'm still an aspirant...\nIn the website it's mentioned\n720+720\n480+241\nRr   + ec\nâ”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ Yeah it's identical to ours. Except 240 aiml students from both campuses each\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ There's 480 AIML seats in RR campus?\nâ”‚           â””â”€â”€ Yes..\nâ”‚               â””â”€â”€ What is the KCET-PESSAT split of the 480 seats\nâ”‚                   â””â”€â”€ 60% PESSAT 40% KCET\nâ””â”€â”€ Where are you getting this info of doubled? From what ik there is an increase in AIML seats, no change in CS, in total it's nowhere near double"

You think it's comparable with other colleges or more on the stricter side.\nâ”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ Like school.\nâ”‚           â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Nothing new?\nâ”‚           â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ A good gym maybe and some good clubs like chess dance and all.\nâ”‚           â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Hey, what do u think about the doubling of seats? Do you think it will lower the quality of placements, or do you think the college will strive to bring in more companies for placements?\nâ”‚           â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Lower but if have decent knowledge and gpa you will get a good placement.\nâ”‚           â””â”€â”€ Engineering colleges share the same culture... its no better here.. but the assessments are peace, professors are good, labs are good. And most important, you will find like minded peers and having such high intake , you can network with lot of people, seniors as well\nâ”‚               â””â”€â”€ Alright good to know, thank you\nâ””â”€â”€ It s still under 1000 for cse in pesu please check ur facts.\n    â””â”€â”€ EC at 4K \nAnd mech at some 15K ??\n\nLike seriously, this generation has ruined everything"
