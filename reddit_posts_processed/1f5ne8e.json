Core courses r the same\n    ├── Idk situation rn , some say they're mostly the same. Lots of people in past say there's quite some difference and course is unorganised. \nFor exact differences check faqs, idk if the same is true rn.\n    └── But will unis abroad know that? Idt they'll check the course details of PESU. What they might do is make assumptions based on \"AIML\" being written on your degree.\n        ├── Ofc they will know the difference because while applying you need to list out courses you've taken and submit your transcript\n        │   └── so with the current curriculum. should I prefer rr aiml or ec cse? masters is main motive for me\n        │       └── Id honestly pick based on travel time.\n Core is better but only slightly\n        │           └── rr is 10km closer than ec, but I wanna pursue masters in aiml itself. so which would be better?\n        └── Quite the contrary,  they check each and every course you've done and see if it matches with their requirements."
