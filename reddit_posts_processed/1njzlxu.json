  "content": "This story is of my own elder brother who studied in PES RR campus cse batch 2015-2019. He was a brilliant student and had topped his school too prior coming to pes. But in College he became a lot distracted and was not able to keep up a good gpa(final gpa was 7.48) and did not have great coding skills by the time of his placements. I still remember how he used to be very gloomy and depressed too because of the choices he made, while all his ffreinds getting placed in good mncs with great package. H was not placed till 8th sem and he was one of the last people to be placed in a tier 3 company. But he had learnt his lesson and instead of brooding on the past he decided to work even more harder and learn new stuff after joining his company. He was constantly upskilling himslef inspite of the heavy workload he used to have. Now after 6 years he is working in one of the FAANG companies and now also he has not stopped doing leetcode since he has found coding to be his passion after college. He always tells me no matter what ur field of interest we should never stop learning....does not matter ur in 1st year or ur a  graduate or u have got ur dream job and ur first company will always teach u MUCH MORE than what u could have possibly learnt in college or by urself as long as u have the will and network properly. So all of you dont lose hopes and keep working hard. Take whatever job u get in this tough market because there are always greater opportunities for u as long as u work hard. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ",
