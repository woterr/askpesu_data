  "content": "Ah, r/PESU—where academics meet memes, and dreams of placements get roasted harder than the samosas in the cafeteria. It's the only subreddit where:\n\nComplaints and Rants: Every thread is either about how 'attendance' is the real boss battle or how professors treat deadlines like an Olympic sport.\n\nEngineering Students' Struggles: Everyone complains about being overworked but finds time to spam memes instead of coding assignments.\n\n\nIt’s a blend of existential crisis, caffeine addiction, and copium—a perfect representation of PES life!\n\nPlacement Mafia: FAANG-or-bust mentality, but half the sub is stuck debugging \"Hello World\". And oh, if you’re in the EC campus, enjoy being treated like the unwanted stepchild.\n\nEvents Nobody Asked For: Another random guest lecture? Great, because nothing screams career growth like sleeping through a session by “Motivational Speaker: Uncle From LinkedIn”.\n\nHostel Hell: Luxury pricing for prison-cell vibes. Wi-Fi slower than your job search and food that’s a gastronomical dare.\n\nIn short, it’s where you grind for 4 years, only to realize you should’ve joined r/dropshipping instead.\n\n",
