But in pes in your second year as Long as you have a high cgpa , around 9.5 you can change your branch to cse too. Right now the syllabus of cse and aiml are pretty much same except the electives in 3rd year . So choose your clg be it msrit or pes based on your convenience,  like fees , distance from house , etc.\n        ├── Hello can you please tell the electives of cse with aiml?\n        │   └── check FAQ\n        ├── Thank you so much my man. Distance doesn't matter since I'm coming from a long way. So prolly gonna stay in the hostels or nearby pg.\n        └── tier 2 iit and nit bfr"

Most of my relatives know about MSRIT but only a few of them knew PES.\nHow do they both differ?\n    └── idk man, all my relatives know about pes, even ones who live in other states.   \nI heard msrit culture is not that good or something, plus its VTU college so old syllabus.   \nYou wont have a massive difference between the three though, all have their own flaws and benefits."
