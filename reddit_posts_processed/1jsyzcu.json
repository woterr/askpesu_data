  "content": "**OFFICE OF THE CHANCELLOR**  \n**PES UNIVERSITY**  \n**Jawahar Memorial Disciplinary Tribunal**\n\n**URGENT MEMO**  \nDate: 6/4/2025  \nTo: Miss Senior Ma’am & Mister Freshie  \nSubject: Baskin Robbins Stallgate (AT)\n\nIt has come to my esteemed attention—via anonymous reports, multiple witnesses, and an uncomfortably detailed Reddit thread—that a *most disturbing* incident unfolded at the Baskin Robbins stall during the recent concert event. A senior student (hereby referred to as [u/\\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/_/)[Truetomyself](https://www.reddit.com/user/_Truetomyself/)) approached a first-year student (user [u/creepykimchi](https://www.reddit.com/user/creepykimchi/)) and initiated unsolicited small talk under suspiciously sociable circumstances.\n\n**Summons:** Both parties are hereby required to appear before the Chancellor in person on **Monday at 9:00 AM** at my Cabin tomorrow. (if you cannot come due to ISA, a proper email is required to be sent from your official college email ID to [jawahar@pes.edu](mailto:jawahar@pes.edu) before 9:00 am tomorrow).\n\nThe incident has been deemed as:\n\n* **Violation of Article 7.2** of the PESU Social Conduct Code: *\"No senior shall interrogate, flirt with, or emotionally bewilder freshers without explicit academic or club-related context.\"*\n* **Breach of Chill Protocol 2023**, wherein all interactions must maintain a healthy balance of mutual interest and non-creepiness.\n\n**Actions under Consideration:**\n\n1. **For the Senior Student:**\n   * Temporary suspension from all informal event committees.\n   * Mandatory attendance in the “How to Not Accidentally Intimidate Freshers” workshop conducted by the Department of Social Subtlety.\n   * Community service: Supervising the ice cream stall at the next event without speaking to any students under the age of 19.\n2. **For the First-Year Student:**\n   * Counseling session to help recover from the trauma of spontaneous small talk.\n   * Award of 1 bonus attendance point for bravery under social pressure.\n   * Option to anonymously review the entire interaction for case study purposes in the PESU Guide to Student Safety.\n\n**To the girl in question:**  \nYour identity may be hidden *for now*, but PESU’s Surveillance Department (PSD) is already mobilized. If you do not report yourself to the Chancellor’s Office by **Monday 9:00 AM**, the following actions will be taken:\n\n1. Your face will be reconstructed from CCTV footage + crowd-sourced eye-witness sketches.\n2. The PESU Internet Council will trace your digital scent across Reddit, Instagram, and Discord.\n3. Once identified, a **Stricter Disciplinary Package** will be applied:\n   * **Level 2 Suspension** from all fun for the remainder of the semester.\n   * Forced volunteering as “ice-cream scooper-in-chief” for the next 3 events, no talking allowed.\n   * Inclusion in the annual *PESU Casebook of Weird Incidents*, to be quoted in orientation speeches for years to come.\n\nLet this be a warning to all senior students: PESU does **not** condone unsolicited fresher engagement without proper clearance and at least two mutual LinkedIn connections.\n\n**By Order of the Chancellor,**  \n**Jawahar R.**  \n*Chancellor, PES University*",
