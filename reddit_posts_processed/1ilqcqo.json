I'm Praeksha, a BSc. Psychology student, and I would really appreciate it if you could take some time out of your day to answer this survey for a research paper I'm working on. Please take the survey only if you belong to Gen X or Gen Z and circulate it around on other groups as well.\n\nThank you! Here's a little token of gratitude üç™"

Given that they don't get dedicated labs or research time it's not really a priority for the institute. But due to NIRF ranking they do push for Scopus papers.\n\nIs it ideal ? No, Is it good? Sort of, it's better than nothing.\n\nBut I'll tell you where It helps, I cracked a top tier institute cause I knew what to do in terms of research the basic stuff formatting, literature coding related to it etc. I learned most of it thankfully to a cousin who was a PhD student but I did get some stuff waived from internship requirements cause I did get that paper in Scopus which btw pre Covid used to be a big deal for in year 3.\n\nI have worked (and am still working) with PES students on some research and I can tell you that they are better than most when they have time. üòÖThe later part was due to the high amount of activities they don't usually get much time for research except a few people.\n\nBut it's really good to see people asking about research üôå, feel free to ask if you need any help in it."
