It was clearly communicated that the final results will be declared on Monday\nâ”œâ”€â”€ But doesn't it mean those 40 are hired?\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ No, IBM and other companies are known for this.\nDo not assume you're selected unless explicitly told so.\nEven then some cases like Walmart happen\nâ”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ what happened to walmart?\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ but from what ive heard is that they did announce all those 40 odd people were hired\nâ””â”€â”€ What !? like the company came to the campus with fingerprint and iris scanners or something?\n\nCould you elaborate on what you were asked in all the interview rounds"
