I had c as well in first sem math, right now I am in 4th sem and my cgpa is a bit above 9 . \n\nI think I remember vice chancellor saying 8.5-8.75 is easily enough so just focus on other remaining ones. \n\nSem-2 math is easier btw\nâ””â”€â”€ Engineering mathematics-2 you mean?\n    â””â”€â”€ Yes\n        â””â”€â”€ Good to know thatðŸ’€"

      "body": "Oh, Math 1 is a bloodbath. This is going to sound like a brag but the only time I've gotten less than an A was in Math 1, and that was a C. Don't take this exam as the standard for question papers lol, it's basically academic hazing xD\nâ”œâ”€â”€ What topics are there for sem 3 math?\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Uh, depends on your stream. In CS, you will have a statistics course and a course on the theory of computation. Other departments have EM3, which I believe covers a bit of statistics and some complex analysis.\nâ””â”€â”€ That's kinda relieving to know. But is it possible to get a good gpa with other subjects . I mean how did u manage a 9 in everything else. I have about an estimated 43+ in internals.\n    â””â”€â”€ Wait internals are out of 50 right? 43+ is amazing.   \n\n\nAs for getting a good GPA, tbh dude, I can't help you there. The method honestly varies from person to person. In general though, I find that writing stuff down helps me remember theory better, and just as many problems as possible for more practical subjects.\n        â””â”€â”€ I guess the thing I'm ultimately worried about is there any scope of scoring in the other 5 subs ESA to bring sgpa up. I'm scared shirtless since afternoon about this ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜…. Because ppl also say it's tougher to increase gpa in further sems and the first 2 form the basis of it.\n            â””â”€â”€ Football is played on grass and exams are written on paper, friend :3  Go give it your best shot, and if you mess up, THEN reassess your strategy."

But it doesn't guarantee you a job. Work on your knowledge and that's much more important. Also a tip for you juniors: start networking on LinkedIn rfn, and, learn as much as you can. \n\nTo answer your question, study a week before exam bro, lowda also you won't study everyday. Idk what branch you are in but get used to math if you're an ece lad."
