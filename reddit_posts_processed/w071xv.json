  "content": "Counselling is on 23rd July, when for CS, I will have to pay 4.2 lakhs (rank 1xx). When will the hostel allocation and payment of fees happen, because that would need another 1.35 to 1.5 lakhs. \n\nWould that be soon as counselling is over (i.e., in July) or closer to start of classes - i.e., late August/early September? Just need it to manage cashflow\n\nAlso, are the hostel fees refundable (if by some miracle JEE or BITSAT is much better in the 2nd attempt)?",
