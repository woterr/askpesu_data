But if you don't have any other options you don't really have a choice. It would help people to answer if you tell us what field do you want to get into, what options you have, and whether you have any plans of higher education\n├── I want to go into cs related branches and i have no interest in other core branches. As of higher education i do not have any definitive plans rn. My only other option is through kcet and idk what i might get .\n│   ├── Try for cs core in second round of pessat counselling\n│   └── Keep trying for CSE in colleges via CET. Worse case you will have the PESSAT seat\n└── Why specialised branches like aiml isnt a good option? \nIsnt it like just cse with few more subjects of aiml in the course?\n    └── [Link to previous answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/144xdwb/comment/jni1zes/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n        └── Thanks very helpful"
