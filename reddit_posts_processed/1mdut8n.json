  "content": "Hey everyone,\nI just released my first mixtape of total 9 songs, and thought I'd share it here with you'll Been working on it on and off during my sems and decided to wrap it all off and polish it this summer break. It's not exactly professionally produced or anything, just something straight out of my heart and the passion to make music. Started out with making beats and sampling during covid and came a long way since then. Hope you'll like it and support it :D Open to your all feedbacks!!!\n\nYoutube link: [OFF ROUTE MIXTAPE](https://youtube.com/playlist?list= PLbWX0LmDX2X6wjTuv5n8PGNUnpOBm5ME4&si= 7ymG4VF7sT00gcHC)\n\nSoundcloud link: [OFF ROUTE MIXTAPE](https://on.soundcloud.com /5a2IXKU11d5DXFiiCJ)",
