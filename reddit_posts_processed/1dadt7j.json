And you should try to get WFH Internship, coz then u can manage capstone reviews and this,\n\nEven I am thinking to apply to a local startup\n└── Why would getting NOC will be a problem??\n    └── College will not give NOC because you are ideally not allowed to do Internship during odd semester.\n        └── ohh k thank you"
