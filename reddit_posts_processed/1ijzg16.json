In our example, this translates to 80-89. Let's assume you got an 89 overall score. \n\nYou know your ISA scores, assignment/lab/project scores as well. Plug it into the overall formula (ISA + ESA + miscellaneous = 89) and you should get your ESA score.\n└── Thank you but\nWill they officially display??\n    └── Nope, not officially displayed.\n        └── If we apply for re-evaluation, will we be able to know our marks?\n            └── Apply for paper review. You'll get to know your marks. Re-eval will simply give you your new grade (which may be same as your old one)\n                └── Can we apply for reval after reviewing the paper or we have to apply before viewing our answer script only?\n                    └── You can review and then choose to apply for re-eval. This is the standard process everyone follows.\n                        ├── Oh got it..\n                        └── How to apply for paper review?"
