If this is the case then it might not matter at all, unless maybe you miss an ISA with an easier syllabus than the others.\n└── Like what are the timings for isa? They conduct it in morning or evening?\n    ├── There are many variables to determine the time slot but it'll be early afternoon\n    │   └── Means it won't be conducted in the morning? Like from 8 or 9\n    │       └── honestly why do you care what time the test is at?\n\nThe COE will decide whatever time to keep the ISA at depending on which other department goes up for ISA at the same time.\n\nWait for the timetable to be released.\n\nAlso in the 5 ISA system, you can afford to skip 1 ISA per subject, but it is not advisable.\n    │           └── Like I've to travel on the same day as my isa is! So I want to know the timings and can i skip one subject or not\n    │               └── Usually from what i have observed cse people have their isa's in the morning and the ece kids around afternoon but i could be wrong\n    └── Oh my sweet summer child, they can keep the Isa literally at any time."
