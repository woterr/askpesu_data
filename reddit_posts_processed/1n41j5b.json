  "content": "Hey everyone,  \nIBM has come for campus placements this year and mentioned the following package:\n\n* **Compensation (Regular):** B.E/ B.Tech / M.E/ M.Tech / M.Sc / Integrated (B.Tech+M.Tech) / Dual (B.Tech+M.Tech) / MCA → **INR 17 Lakh Annual Remuneration + 1.5 Lakh one-time Premium Component + 25,000 one-time Settling In Allowance**\n\nI wanted to check with seniors who are already placed in IBM (through campus) or currently working there:\n\n* How much of this 17 LPA is the **actual in-hand monthly salary**?\n* Does IBM have a big variable component, or is most of it fixed?\n* How are the one-time components (1.5L premium + 25k settling-in) paid—immediately after joining or later?\n* Any deductions (PF, gratuity, taxes) I should be aware of that bring down the take-home?\n\nBasically, I just want to understand the **realistic take-home per month** after all deductions.\n\nWould really appreciate any insights from seniors who are placed in IBM previous year, or anyone who knows these details 🙏",
