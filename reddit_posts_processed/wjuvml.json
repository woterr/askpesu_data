Neither do I have them rn (CBSE has to send those to my school).\n├── Ohh ok\n└── Isn't it all available on digilocker?\n    └── The digilocker ones are different. Official ones from cbse are different. You might've seen your 10th marks card, that is a original document.\n        └── Yea but now my school is telling me the digilocker verified ones are considered originals... It's what I submitted in all other counsellings and it even got approved by comedk. Haven't submitted anything to pes yet."
