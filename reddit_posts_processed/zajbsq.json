A backlog will appear in all your marksheets and you cannot graduate if you have any. You can clear a backlog course either in summer when backlog special exams are held, or the next time the course is conducted next year. \n2. PES does not let you sit for placements if you have a backlog. Besides, most companies also disallow students with backlog to sit for exams. If you do not clear any backlogs before your 7th semester, you pretty much won't have a chance to get placed before 8th semester atleast"
