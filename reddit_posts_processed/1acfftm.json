There have been instances when I just flip away whenever I see a person passing by me, though I’m very much into her. I do not go party with other late night, there’s no friend who’d invite me for their house party. Does this happen only with me?",

Tb sach sach btana ki mena teko like krne lga hu muze starting me lga ki ye natural hai but time to time ye badhta hi ja rha tha . Hm acche friends hai but me dr gya tha ki atleast ye jo friendship hai wo bhi nhi rhegi so mene dur jana hi behtar samza . Ab usko past me koi sa accha incidence memories karao aur bolo ki hmri friends journey yhi tak thi me en memrioes me hi khush hu .

You have  objectified a woman. Shame on you. You seem to want a girl desperately and are resorting to manipulation. Playing with one's emotions for your own selfish needs is just pure evil. this kind of manipulation damages the other person badly because the relationship is not based on trust and respect. Suggesting this method shows you are narcissistic. Grow up, things don't work this way. If you follow such lowly methods you may momentarily gain  but you will eventually lose out in all angles. This will bring a lot of shame too.  Stop behaving like a toddler and behave maturely. People aren't toys to be exploited. \n\nWomen, reading this, be aware.
