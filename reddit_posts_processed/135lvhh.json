      "body": "Big Data won't strictly help you with placement coding tests, so if you want something that will help you clear these tests then advanced algo is the way to go. \n\nData Analytics is a math-heavy course so if you're not into math it's going to be a struggle. It's also got a lot of interesting topics and concepts and if things haven't changed, you get to work on a project and write a paper on your work (some people like me even published their work but that's not required). \n\nI'd suggest taking the course you are interested in. Take the courses that interest you the most and actually matter to you. There is time to prepare for placements a little later, you shouldn't sacrifice your interest in a course for that now."
