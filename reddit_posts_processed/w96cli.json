      "body": "A lot of universities require you to have prerequisite course work in CS to be able to apply. The minor will let you satisfy those prerequisites. Some places will only ask you to report your Major/overall GPA, and other places may ask for your minor GPA separately. \n\nNot sure what year you're in, but if you're just starting out, keep your GPA high and just explore your interests. Doing interesting things like cool technical contests or getting involved with research is also a very good thing to do it you're looking to pursue an MS.\n\nI'm starting my MS in August, so feel free to send me a DM if you're looking for some specific info."
