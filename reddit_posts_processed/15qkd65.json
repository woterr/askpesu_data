Attend without a hall ticket and maybe nobody will ask you. \n\nBut What if someone asks for you and won't allow you later?\n2. If you could find Mr. Tamal Dey, tell him your problem. Most helpful teacher in PES. He'll surely help you. \n\nAll the best!!\nâ””â”€â”€ I have it online could get it printed anyway ty for your advice\n    â””â”€â”€ \"Could you get the invigilator's name on the new copy?\" Is what I meant.\n        â””â”€â”€ No I don't think I'll be able to do that since I don't remember who was my invigilator\n            â””â”€â”€ Did you attend the counselling? Was the hall ticket compulsory?\n                â””â”€â”€ I took a printout of the hall ticket without the invigilator's sign. There wasn't a problem(you can call the authorities and enquire there tho)"
