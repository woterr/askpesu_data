  "content": "I really wanna try out a few of the events, competitions and orientations, but cannot right now due to some reasons, so I wanted to know if the number and quality of these events will be the same throughout the whole sem and can try them a few weeks later also.   \nOr is it just that these events happen for the first few weeks and then become super rare couple more weeks into the sem?",

Are most of them trash and not valuable?\n    └── Most are trash. Only a handful are good. More quantity != better quality. I've discussed this previously.\n        └── And it's all on the one Wednesday lol"
