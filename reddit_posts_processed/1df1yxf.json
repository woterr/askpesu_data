Makes it simple to just move once at the end of 7th sem right?\n└── True, but idt they give you hostel for half a year, so I decided to take an accommodation outside\n\nPlus, we thought it was time to let loose a bit from all the restraints in the hostel and live on our own\n    └── Understandable. Was just curious about the reason. \n\nGood luck with your hunt!\n\nNote - you might find better luck by reaching out on WhatsApp groups for your batch. Reddit is an anonymous platform so people might not be too keen to find roommates here."
