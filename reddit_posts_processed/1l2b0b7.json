Or if you cannot find their ongoing projects, look at their past work. \n\nAlso revisiting this earlier discussion: https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/s/hEqVBdv0Yj\n\nI have submitted a research proposal for which I would be the mentor (if people are interested and they approve it). You'll know it's me once you see the proposal (I think, idk how it works right now)."
