I deleted IG , and my mental health is better. \n        └── Are you missing out smtg? Like people say it's better to have an ig account, it helps in building connections and stuff, is it true?\n            ├── Nope. If u wanna build connections u got LinkedIn for that. I found that scrolling was eating most of time away so I quit. U can build connections in other ways like discord and LinkedIn . \n            │   └── Ah, okay.. Thanks a lot mann..\n            └── bro make linkedin for connections and career related stuff /reaching out to seniors . Instagram is cool if you want to know only whats happening in your closest circle of say 20 friends if its beyond that it just becomes a huge distraction , endless scrolling ,time waste in reading confessions of who likes whom in your class lmfao . I personally deleted mine for a better life , I found myself constantly comparing my life with my followers and it just sucked. Just call friends once a week or so catch up with their real life, share your problems, ask for help if you need some, keep it real, Only the real ones stay in touch after school . Instagram is only the highlights ,nobody posts their lowlights on there.\n                └── Okay bro.. Sure.."
