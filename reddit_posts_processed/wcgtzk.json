Classes will start from August 22nd and the last day to withdraw is August 16th... They're making it in such a way that people think a lot before withdrawing.\n    └── I don't know much about KCET dates and procedures but they'll most likely try to start the session for both PESSAT and KCET people together this year. I think they'll make few sections later for KCET round 2 and 3 peeps and they'll try to sync up all the sections before ISAs."
