      "body": "Even if you finish the all slides/classnotes which is a lot, questions in the exam wont come straightforward. In the exams the focus is on Understanding of the concept and logical thinking and application of concepts theyve taught. Very few subjects in CSE course are theoretical and Memorization based. There are assignments, quiz for lab components , 2 internals, 1 end semester and a mini project for each subject. All these together will contribute to determine your final grade. Scoring even 8 cgpa will require consistent efforts throughout the semester. In comedk colleges you should be able to get 8 or even 9 by studying even just 2 days before the exam, it all comes directly from previous year papers."
