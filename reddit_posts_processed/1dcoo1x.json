Scroll and find the post.\n└── Bro, is EC campus very strict?I have heard a couple of guys saying that it is , regarding dress code and attendance..etc\n    ├── Attendance criteria is the same across campuses. Rest are rare incidents that occur and aren't campus specific.\n    │   └── can i join with pessat students when college starts and not wait until second ext round to go to clg?\n    └── Yep. Ec campus is the worst. It's not only about the attendance, but also the environment, the faculty and the way the students are treated here\n        └── oh is it? could you elaborate a little?\n            └── It's really not. Both campuses are the same."
