I kept it high since I'm planning on doing mg masters\n                        â”œâ”€â”€ First year here. Can u tell me what u did in your first year.? And how'd u maintain gpa and explore ur interests?\n                        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ dm me\n                        â””â”€â”€ lets say i have a 9.2 and someone has a 9.4,will the company pick the one with better skills or the one with better [gpa.is](http://gpa.is) it fine if we keep it above 9 and work on cs related stuff?(1st year here)\n                            â””â”€â”€ Look at the FAQs on the subreddit for a detailed answer.\n\nIn short though, after you clear the gpa cutoff as mentioned by a company, it doesn't matter anymore. \n\nKeep a good balance of both skills and gpa. 8.5+ is fine, 9+ is to be absolutely safe. The issue is that there are so many of you kids that companies sometimes can't conduct tests/interviews for all, so they keep a higher gpa cutoff. Only a few companies have a 9.5+ cutoff, but these are a very small number."
