Though there aren't many events they host, it's a pretty chill and welcoming club. I can't say much about the other clubs tho..\n        └── Okay, im actually kinda interested in german, have been learning it in duo for like an year now, does it help?\n            ├── Okay so there are people who already know german or are learning rn. You can talk about something you have learnt, get your doubts solved, solve others' doubts and even teach in language workshops.\n\nThere will be recruitments in the upcoming semester. Keep an eye out for them!\n            └── Knowing a language isn't really a requirement to join the club, a general interest and passion to learn is more than enough to get in.\nAnd yes, the club does have regular language workshops in various languages that are open to everyone . The club has a higher community that has regular discussions on books, poetry, anime languages and much more..so do check it out whenever ur free"
