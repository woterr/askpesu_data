Do we need a lot of textbooks or will they provide pdfs for everything?\n    └── Mostly u won't be allowed to take digital notes. Notes will be available on pesuacademy but do try to read parts of textbook they recommend. Try to get the pdf of the textbooks if u cannot afford. \n        └── Thank you!"
