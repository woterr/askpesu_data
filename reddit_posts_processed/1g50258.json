Its all a practical exercise to see who can cope better and become a programmed bot for these companies to come pick up off the assembly line. \n\nI feel bad for you man. Classes till 5 and you probably reach home at 6 or 7. Might as well live at pes at that point\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Honestly, first sem subjects, with the exception of python are useless.\n\nIMO you cannot teach programming in a class. All you can teach are the APIs and the syntax, the two things you can *easily* lookup.\n\nKnowing how to reason about a problem is something that no teacher can teach. It only comes with practice.\n\nGo forth, and build stuff!\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Python faculty ain't very good tho.\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ And?\n\nTeach yourself, you can do it\nâ”‚           â””â”€â”€ That's the only way.\nâ””â”€â”€ This is just general Indian education atp"

Even if the counselling wasn't delayed you would still be having regular classes till 4:45 because 1st and 2nd round students are already way ahead of you. We all have ISAs at the same time so they have no other choice either."
