Ask personally and not in front of the entire class to increase the likelihood of them saying okay. They fear that students would get iPads and do something that's not taking notes in the middle of class. \n\nI've not yet seen any prof objecting to taking notes on iPads. Laptops are a different story though, some profs allow and many don't as laptops are more easy to _multitask_  in\n└── Thanks a lot!\nI was thinking of the same thing, asking first. \nHonestly I thought college would be a lot more relaxed, and considering how PES claims to be so “Tech forward” they’d be more digital focused."
