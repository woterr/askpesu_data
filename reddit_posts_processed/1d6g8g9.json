Somebody sent me a chat request regarding getting CSE-AIML at PES or something like that, I accidentally closed the chat and lost their username. The person that sent me the request, please DM me again, I'm sorry for messing up ðŸ’€. I wanna help that person out if possible. (I was coding some on laptop and checking reddit on phone will be my excuse)",
