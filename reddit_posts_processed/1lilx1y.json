That hasn't shown up yet.\n                └── Yeah you are right ! Revaluation results shows up like No change or Grade changed from A to S kinda thing. But they keep changing stuff like emailing scholarship and no list and all that so was confused\n                    └── Have they sent the mail already for scholarships?"
