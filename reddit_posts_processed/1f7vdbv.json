      "body": "The library entrance is on the 1st floor and has a total of 3 floors. The 3rd floor is locked so you can't enter it usually (unless you have permission). There are tables and plug points so you can bring your laptop and work/ study for exams last minute XD. As for borrowing books, you can borrow a maximum of 3(i think?) books for 2 weeks after which you can either renew for another 2 weeks or return the books."
