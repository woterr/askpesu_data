  "title": "[Rant] Regarding Rowlet's Take on Placement Luck",
  "content": "Good morning r/PESU!\n\n\n\nI wanna preface this post with this: I'm a third year student with very very limited (basically none) experience in on-campus interviews/placements, all the opinions and tidbits I mention here are opinions that are subject to personal biases. I'm absolutely not an authority on this. I'm simply applying the wisdom I've gained from *other* aspects of my life to this specific context. \n\nWhile I don't know him personally, I did some minor quick research on who u/rowlet-owl is and it seems that, all things considered, he's done very well for himself. Rowlet, if you're reading this, I'm very happy for you. From the little research I've done, it's clear that you're a talented individual with tons of achievements and work to back your prowess.\n\nI'm not writing this to personally attack you, I have no problem with you, or anybody in particular, But, people trust you a *lot*, including myself, The help that you give has been (and will probably continue to be) invaluable to the students of this college. If it feels like I'm attacking you in this post, that's purely because I believe that, *in this* ***specific*** *case,* I have a valuable counterpoint to the comment you shared regarding the role of luck in placements.\n\n[In a recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/1n17tp1/offtopic_does_luck_matter_in_placements/), Rowlet pinned a comment emphasizing skill as the primary driver for success, arguing that luck merely \"opens a door\" and it's our job to walk through it. While I agree that skill is non-negotiable, I believe this framework can unintentionally underestimate how brutal luck can be and shift blame onto those who, despite their skill, never even get a door to open.\n\n1. **Luck Isn't Just the Door; It's the Map to the Door.**\n\nThe analogy of luck opening a door assumes you've already found the building. In placements, luck dictates *which* doors appear, *when* they appear, and *what's on the other side*. An incredibly talented person might never get a shortlist because their resume was parsed by an algorithm on a bad day, because a recruiter was in a hurry, or because a company's needs shifted slightly. \n\nSolving an OA 100% is a fantastic display of skill, but as Rowlet noted, it's not a guarantee. Why? Because factors outside your control, sheer luck, often influence the next step.\n\nHe argued that *'luck simply opens a door but it's still on you to walk through that door and drive it home.'* I think this framework misses a crucial earlier stage. For his analogy to hold true, a person must already possess a car (the resources, time, and foundation to build skills) and a home (a safety net that allows for risk). These are not given; they are themselves products of immense privilege and luck. The real-world application is that it's entirely possible for a skilled person to never even get a chance to impress an interviewer—not because they failed to 'drive,' but because they were never given the keys to a car. The luck of the interview question is a secondary concern compared to the fundamental luck of being in the room in the first place.\n\n**He said** as a response to an anecdotal case study regarding a meesho student’s success story that he got placed as a result of his skill. I do not disagree with this, but I think he missed the point of the case study entirely he said “....your friend putting in efforts at the right time”, Which brings me to my next point, \n\n\n\n**2. \"Effort at the Right Time\" is Another Way of Saying \"Luck with Timing.\"**\n\nI'm not underestimating the role of the student’s talent and skill in their 56LPA placement. They absolutely deserved that job, but if you’re saying that they got the job as a result of their skill **and** that project’s timing, you are implying a role of luck in their placement.\n\nI.e. An identical student with that student’s skill level but without their project timing, may not have gotten that job despite being virtually the same in all other aspects. Does that not sound like luck to you?\n\nThat student’s skill was always present, but had he not done that one android project, it is implied that he may never had had the opportunity strike, and this is just another way that an incredibly talented person can be deprived of the opportunity to showcase their prowess\n\n**3. The Risk of the Hindsight Bias.**\n\nRowlet said “Cherry-picking examples that support your argument does not help. I have been on both sides of the interviewing process since 2021 - both in India and here in the US”\n\nRowlet, I appreciate you sharing your perspective from both sides of the table; that insight is rare and valuable. However, by using your personal experience as the primary evidence to dismiss the experiences of others as 'cherry-picking,' you're engaging in the same methodology you're criticizing. A truly unbiased view would require us to look at aggregate data and statistical trends, not just compelling individual stories, including our own.\n\nIt's human nature to look back on a successful path and attribute it to a series of skillful choices. It's much harder to see the points where luck intervened, the interview question that happened to be on your favorite topic, the connection that passed your resume along, the competitor who withdrew their application. This \"hindsight bias\" can lead successful people to underestimate the lucky breaks they got, making it seem like a purely meritocratic journey. This isn't a slight against their talent; it's just a common cognitive bias.\n\n  \n  \nIn conclusion, I think that Rowlet may be wrong about his take on the role of luck in placements. And my thinking may be wrong, I’m sure that by the time most users read this, Rowlet has already corrected me on multiple points in a strongly worded and pinned comment below this post.\n\nIn my opinion, It's impossible to get a decent job without insane skill AND some luck. As a student, you can’t really grind luck, but you CAN grind skill. \n\nYour journey is defined by the skills you build, but your breakthrough might be defined by a moment of luck. You can't control luck, but you can absolutely control your readiness for it. So grind, build, and prepare. And when things don't go your way, remember: it's not a reflection of your worth. Your time will come.\n\n\n\n**All the best with placement season, folks**\n\n**And as always, I love you 💙**",

See the top comment, even I personally know people who have never even stressed themselves out working way above most people's pay grade and they themselves have said to me it was just luck.\n    └── I can give you a contrasting example of a friend of mine, he worked really hard for 2 years for JEE, he got the most toughest paper of 2025 jee mains 1st attempt, usually for people who have done good work while preparing for jee mains, tough paper will boost their percentile, he got around 8k rank in mains, then in advance he bought it down to 3k, so getting tough paper was in his favour ie luck followed hard work\n        └── Man JEE paper and placement/career are very different things.\nBad luck in mains shift may hurt your percentile by a few %ile but bad luck in placement will leave you unemployed.\nHardwork is important, but luck is also important. Hardwork will just allow you to leverage your opportunities, if you knew how the placement system works you would know how much luck is the process. Even with all the skills in the world you couldn't leverage them without getting an opportunity."

      "body": "Part 1/n\n\nFirstly, thank you for raising a civilised discussion about this. As someone who has never turned down an opportunity for constructive debate, it's refreshing to discuss without the usual downvoting or not backing up their opinions with any reason (or worse, sending abuse on DM).\n\nSecondly, I think most misunderstood what I had to say. I never claimed that luck does not help. In fact, I started my statement with: \"*luck matters everywhere in life. But the extent to which it helps you depends on how well you capitalise on it.*\" So, I never said that luck does not exist or help you. What my primary agenda states is simply, \"luck isn't *everything*\". I have always believed that luck brings only those to the finish line who can put in the remaining 90%. To the others who do not put in the required effort, it would feel like luck is cheating them.\n\n\\---\n\n>In placements, luck dictates which doors appear, when they appear, and what's on the other side. An incredibly talented person might never get a shortlist because their resume was parsed by an algorithm on a bad day, because a recruiter was in a hurry, or because a company's needs shifted slightly. \n\nThese factors: resume parsing algorithms, recruiter moods, etc affect everyone in the same way. Nobody is immune to them. That's precisely why I think of them as \"universal randomness\" rather than **decisive outcomes**. What that means is, if you are unlucky enough to have your resume parsed by a poor algorithm, so is everyone else's. Everyone is rolling those dice but I believe people with stronger profiles, stronger resumes, and stronger prep simply have more rolls when those opportunities come around. \n\nOr in a slightly poetic style: *Luck can shut a door for you on a bad day, but it can't consistently keep you out if you've built the kind of profile that can break the door down.*\n\n>For his analogy to hold true, a person must already possess a car (the resources, time, and foundation to build skills) and a home (a safety net that allows for risk). These are not given; they are themselves products of immense privilege and luck. \n\nThere are two issues from my pov. (1) First, the privilege. I definitely do agree that some start closer to being able to build a good profile compared to others (I was one of them). But while privilege is real, let's be honest: for 99% of folks, what you do in the 3 years leading up to placement is far more influential in your placement journey, compared to what you did in the 18 years of your life. Once you're in the same college, sitting through the same classes, having access to the same clubs/labs, the gap created by privilege narrows significantly. At that point, consistent effort in the 3 years starts to outweigh the background. Privilege might help you start the race a few steps ahead, but if you do not run, even being 100 steps ahead is futile.\n├── Part 2/3\n\n>An identical student with that student’s skill level but without their project timing, may not have gotten that job despite being virtually the same in all other aspects. Does that not sound like luck to you?\n\nAnd (2) about timing. IMO \"effort at the right time\" is *not* pure luck. I'd argue that \"timing\" is often a combination of high awareness and effort: knowing where you lack (projects/exp/skills), how to cover those gaps, and most importantly, when to cover them, spefically being able to act on them early. That, unlike \"pure luck\", is *not* random chance; that is strategy. If you seize an opportunity early (say, you reached out to a prof and started working with them), and you invest in it, that's still an *intentional* act of effort. The friend who made the app was very self-aware, had foresight, and solid execution, not just a coin flip. Two equally skilled candidates may have different outcomes because one anticipated where they were lacking and acted early: that's not luck so much as realisation and strategy. They *aren't* actually “identical” in all respects because the *very* decision to build that project is part of what makes someone stand out. Timing simply amplifies the *impact* of your work, but the work has to *exist* in the first place. \n\n>A truly unbiased view would require us to look at aggregate data and statistical trends, not just compelling individual stories, including our own.\n\nVery fair, and I agree that hindsight bias is real and my own experiences aren't universally representative. But my point wasn't to say \"*because it happened to me, it must be true for everyone*\". All I am doing is triangulating from multiple perspectives: personal experiences, peer cases, and whatever data we *do* have. \n\n\\---  \nTo conclude, I agree that luck plays a role; in fact, it always will. But where I differ is in *how much weight* we assign to it. Luck can tilt outcomes in the short run, but over the course of multiple opportunities, it is preparation, consistency that decide whether you eventually convert those chances. The primary reason I even made my original comment was not to deny luck, but to prevent juniors from walking away with the impression that luck is all you need, and without it, you're doomed to fail. That mindset can be incredibly demotivating, especially to incoming students who read about the experiences of final years.\n\nI corroborate with you that as students, the only lever we truly control is our own effort. \"Y*ou can't grind luck, but you can grind skill*\" - exactly my point as well, and that assures that when luck does show up, you're ready to make the most of it.\n│   └── Part 3/3\n\n>While I don't know him personally, I did some minor quick research on who [u/rowlet-owl](https://www.reddit.com/user/rowlet-owl/) is and it seems that, all things considered, he's done very well for himself. Rowlet, if you're reading this, I'm very happy for you. From the little research I've done, it's clear that you're a talented individual with tons of achievements and work to back your prowess.\n\nAnd thank you, much appreciated. I'm just sharing my experiences in the hope that they help others, and I wish you the best for your placements too.\n└── A thoughtful, civilised debate on the Internet!
