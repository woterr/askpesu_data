But plz don't expect it u never know with pes and 1st year are easy too\n        â””â”€â”€ In sem 1 nearly 300 ppl failed in maths and this sem ISA1 math was very horrible. If tomorrow's math paper they give it tough,all r screwed!\n            â””â”€â”€ I have no hopes that it'll be easy. Even though the majority fucked up ISA 1 in sem 1, they gave a terrible esa paper. So jusy prepare for the worst tomorrow.\n                â””â”€â”€ Our sem 1 esa math paper was also horrible but sem 2 paper was much better"
