Like was it difficult?\n    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Hci is a course that will neither improve your gpa nor your skills,i dont remember exactly but during my time for ec campus,nearly 60-70% of student got C or worse\n    â”œâ”€â”€ Ac is good choice. Easy to score as long as you read the slide well\n    â””â”€â”€ advanced algo is really easy to score if you take notes in class. All questions from isa and esa come from what is done in class."
