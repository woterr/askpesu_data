      "body": "Nope, there are no scholarships for PESSAT ranking.....   \nHowever you can earn one upto 50% of total fees back by scoring well after joining PES.\n└── I see... Btw what is the total fee for 4 years?\n    └── I think for your batch CSE its 4.8L so 4.8 \\* 4\n        ├── Then I'm definitely not going there lol\n        ├── Isn't this only the tuition fees ?\n        │   └── No its the total. Including tuition, examination fees etc\n        │       └── I meant hostel mess is excluded\n        └── Is it worth joining?  How is the overall campus experience for you?\n            └── Do you have other options? Is pes your only option?\n                └── I have a pretty good rank for pessat 160 something rank so I might consider it. I have nitk civil and vit Cs too. Anyone please guide me🙏🙏\n                    └── Idk about NITK But i'd suggest PES CSE over VIT CSE honestly\n                        └── Thanks I'll consider tht"
