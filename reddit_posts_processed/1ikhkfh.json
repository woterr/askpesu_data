Even though we didn’t have relative grading in physics cycle in the second semester, my sgpa shot up by 0.8. \n\n\nI was in the same spot as you last year, with the same sgpa in semester 1. All I'll say is, don’t beat yourself up just yet. figure out what went wrong. For me, it was wasting time and relying on cramming stuff my whole life without actually learning how to study. Once you get that sorted, you’ll improve."
