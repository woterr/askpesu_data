Now in CSE, 9.53cgpa is mrd cutoff\nâ”œâ”€â”€ so 8.8+sgpa is a safe bet for cnr? in phy cycle\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Yes it is, last time it was 8.6+\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ ok thankss\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Wait so mrd and cnr are awarded for both sems?\nI thought cnr is given for both 1st and 2nd sem \nWhereas mrd is given for the cgpa resulted from both the sems\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Mrd/cnr/dac is given for every sem with your sgpa for cnr and cgpa for mrd (cgpa=sgpa for first sem)\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ What if a person gets mrd both the sems of a year \nThen 100% of the fees is given back?\nâ”‚           â””â”€â”€ ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­no\nMrd for one semester = 25% of ur annual fees\nSo mrd both sems means you get 50% refund of your annual fees\nSuppose u pay 4.5L per year\nIt means u pay 2.25L per sem\nSo if u get MRD u get 50% of sem fees back, so 1.125L you get it back.\nâ”‚               â””â”€â”€ Okay yeah makes sense i thought mrd is 50% of annual fees mb\nâ”‚                   â””â”€â”€ It is if you get it for the 2 sems in a year\nâ”‚                       â””â”€â”€ Yeah\nâ””â”€â”€ Bro what if the 5% of CGPA holders also come under the Top 20% of SGPA holders. Then will Top 25% of SGPA holders be considered for CNR Scholarships or is it still top 20% only?\n    â””â”€â”€ After the top 5% cgpa is filtered out of the pool, then the top 20% of that pool is filtered for sgpa\n        â””â”€â”€ Yess got it"
