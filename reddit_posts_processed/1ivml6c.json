Hopefully they are in their first semester and can turn things around.\n\nContext: [https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/1i73c42/comment/m8k2fah](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/1i73c42/comment/m8k2fah)\nâ””â”€â”€ How do I convince this guy to work more hard tho, he keeps watching movies and stuff\n    â””â”€â”€ You can only tell your \"friend\" about the consequences. It's upto them whether they want to put in more effort. If they don't want to achieve success or are simply too ignorant about their future, there's only so much one can do. At the end of the day, only they are responsible for their career."
