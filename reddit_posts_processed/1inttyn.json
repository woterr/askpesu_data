  "content": "Hi anna matte akkandire. My jee result came out and I secured 94.6 percentile . Is this a good score to join Pesu also whenever I go to their website they ask me to put an application with an application fees of 1200. Is it really necessary to put this application. Won't Kcet counseling or Jee counseling allot me a seat in Pesu without filing an application with Pesu?.\nDanyavada",
