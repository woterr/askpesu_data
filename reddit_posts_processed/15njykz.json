  "title": "ECE 3rd Year, 4th Year, or Graduated Students: Your Insights Needed",
  "content": "Dear seniors please help me.. üôè\nI am currently in my 3rd semester of ECE and I am facing a dilemma regarding whether to continue focusing on my core subjects or to consider shifting to CS. \n PES hasn't provided much information about ECE core placements. Since some of you have already graduated or are close to graduating, I would greatly appreciate it if you could share your insights regarding the core placement scenario at our college.\n\nI've noticed that most of the people who get good employment opportunities in this field have mtech degree. \nOne of my concerns is that I am unable to pursue M.Tech due to financial constraints. My goal is to secure a job by the end of my 4th year. I am curious about the placement prospects for freshers in ECE. Can we realistically secure good/decent package without pursuing an M.Tech?\n\nFurthermore, I am interested in understanding the potential job market for ECE graduates in the future.\n It would be immensely helpful if any of the 4th-year seniors could provide guidance based on your experiences.\n\nThank you in advance for taking the time to share your knowledge and advice. Your insights would be invaluable in helping me make an informed decision about my career path.",
