  "content": "As the title suggests, I wanted opinions and predictions regarding the movement in KCET cutoff this year, that is, when it moves from the mock round to the first round and then from the first round to the second round and from the second round to the second extended round. I know it's hard to say anything at this point, but I'm okay with predictions and opinions. (Will there be a usual movement, or whether it won't move at all and so on)   \nThanks!",
