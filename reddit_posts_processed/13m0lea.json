But I'm not sure if you can give it in the ESA season *and* the next summer break. You should preferably ask someone in the University for concrete information.\n└── If I fail a subject and clear it the same summer, will it still be a backlog?\n    └── It won't be an *active* backlog anymore. But your transcript will always show that you had a backlog as far as I know."
