How many hours per week should I dedicate to each to make significant progress? Also, I plan to start going to the gym regularly. Will I have enough time to balance all three?\n\nAny advice or personal experiences would be appreciated!\n\n\n\n",

All u have is 4 hrs left and in that time u need to manage academics + DSA. Now u think, will u able to manage. Also one important thing if u go gym ull be tired. I used to sleep 1st 2 classes everyday 😁. \n\nSo I would suggest start one thing either gym or DSA. Do that consistently for one or two months. Then start the other one. Ig then ull able to figure out what to. And also both gym and DSA need consistency 💪🏻\n\nAll the best !!\n└── Thanks for ur advice!!"
