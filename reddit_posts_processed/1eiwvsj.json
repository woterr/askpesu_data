You cannot pull an overnight study and expect a good grade, you will barely pass. You need to put in time for academics at least a week or two before the test to score well. Each course has many deliverables too and you need to perform well in every component to get a good grade. Finally, tests aren't easy. You need to study and also write the answers properly to score well, which means you often cannot bs your way through a test. Correction tends to be on the stricter side sometimes so do not expect leniency. Overall, if you want to score well in PES it requires quite a bit of effort. Scoring an 8+ is easy, 8.5+ is doable with some effort, 9+ is difficult and 9.5+ requires incredible effort and dedication.\n\nSome links you can refer to (please also do your own research by going through the sub):\n\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/1d66ywv/comment/l6qhycx/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/1d66ywv/comment/l6qhycx/)\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/1cea6uq/comment/l1hd26d/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/1cea6uq/comment/l1hd26d/)\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/1dpt9m0/comment/lajlfjm/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/1dpt9m0/comment/lajlfjm/)\n└── Bros tldr is longer than the original answer"

You have to be on top of your studies to get a good GPA, nothing less than a C is good.\n└── Yo I got cooked with D's and a few E's . As long as you maintain a gpa of more than 7 by 8th sem, you're fine. I'm ECE tho so CS has a high risk high reward thing.  For ECE, mech and EEE, what I said holds due to the mathematical rigour of the course. Just don't get any backlogs, especially in Analog circuit design, electromagnetic field theory, computer architecture, Digital communications and waveguide and antennas. If you get back in these three, it's very hard to clear. Make it your life's goal to clear these in the first attempt and you should be sorted.\n    └── That's what I meant...the more D's and E's you have...the less chance there is to secure a high CGPA. Backlogs can help you improve your gpa but I wouldn't recommend purposing failing to improve your gpa."
