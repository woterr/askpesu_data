      "body": "How grading works is your 2 ISA's are reduced to 20 marks each, ESA is reduced to 50 and assignment/lab to another 10 for a 4 credit course. Totalling up to a 100.\nA score of 90 or above in this would give you an S grade. \nAssuming you get 10/10 in your assignment and perform equally well in both your ISA's and ESA, 35/40 in both your ISA's and 90/100 in your ESA would give you 90/100. You can compromise little on your ISA and make up for it on your ESA and vice versa, but this is a general figure. Your threshold for an S might slightly reduce if there's relative grading.\n└── thank you sm\n    └── Check the FAQs for a more detailed breakdown on how much you need for each grade. There's also a calculator on that link."
