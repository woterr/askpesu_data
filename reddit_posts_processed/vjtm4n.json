  "content": "Ok I know that majority of you guys wouldn't have attempted PESSAT yet because of JEe but I was wondering how it went for the people who have taken it. My test went probably average at best and i could pretty confidently say the same for most of the other people in my time slot(some of them finishing the whole test in an hour, 180 qs btw haha.) Surprisingly it was much harder than expected especially the fill in the blanks questions in math. Would be great if other candidates could share their experience:)",
