Apparently capstone now starts from 5th sem and I've been told by seniors to form a team in 4th sem.\n\nThe problem is , i barely know anyone \nI am interested in doing a good capstone project and it'll be helpful if someone else is also interested in being my teammate. Please DM. \nI'm interested in cs , have done some bash scripting /working on some projects rn but finding teammates who are collaborative is really hard cause i am not good at talking.\n\nPlease DM. I don't know where else to post this",
