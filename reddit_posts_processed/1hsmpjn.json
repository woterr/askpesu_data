So people who got 75+ easily got A grade which would have harder under the older grading scheme where u got a B.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ 11 marks difference?\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Is this for the first semester as well?\nâ””â”€â”€ Is this confirmed? That 35 is passing grade (E) and S is 90 and there is 11 mark diff for every grade i.e., 79 is A, 68 is B, 57 is C and 46 is D?\n    â””â”€â”€ This was what was told to us during the semester orientation so if it's true.Â "

You just need above 9 and you can sit for all companies placement.\n    â”œâ”€â”€ but that cutoff depends on how many people they want to shortlist right? so if everybody's gpa increases won't the cutoff gpa increase as well?\n    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ But they have ruined our results too earlier , so everything balances out of if u consider cgpaÂ \n    â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ okay yeah fair enough\n    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ I don't really think so. It depends on the company tbh. Usually they just send OA to everyone who applied. Some only want the top 100 and so on.\n    â””â”€â”€ bro why 7.5 female cse good DSA is it tough ?\n        â””â”€â”€ If you have good DSA skills then passing OA is peaceful. 7.5 cgpa is pretty hot or miss though. Most tier 1 companies do above 8 or 8.5 . Some do above 7 but it's pretty uncommon nowadays.\n\nCompanies will come to hire only female candidates. You can try them out for better chances although I heard that the OA's are really hard.\n            â””â”€â”€ I quailed for an internship with PPO 31LPA with 6.6 cgpa last sem on campus\n                â””â”€â”€ If you already have a PPO, then you don't have to worry about placements ðŸ˜­\n                    â””â”€â”€ Are you 3rd year ?\n                        â””â”€â”€ Yes, I am (see flair)"
