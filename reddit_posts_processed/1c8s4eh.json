      "body": "3rd Sem is the hardest sem for ECE. There's a subject called Analog circuit design which a few of my friends have still not cleared after 3-4 attempts. All the subjects in 3rd sem are basics that you will use for the next 4 semesters. If you don't pay attention in VLSI classes, you'll find it almost impossible to study on your own. Take 3rd sem Subjects like Network Analysis and Synthesis and Analog circuit design very seriously. They're hard subjects that you need to pay attention to in class. All the subjects in 3rd sem are hard, but after 3rd sem, every other semester will feel like a piece of cake. Good luck!"
