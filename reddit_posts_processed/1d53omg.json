It's known to be a little difficult and if things haven't changed, it's also pretty heavy on assignments. But it's a course that is arguably the most beneficial from a placements POV. A lot of students take up the course to prepare for placements and it often gives them a leg up. So yeah it can be a pain if you struggled with the DAA course to begin with, but people who like those kinds of coursework tend to enjoy it. And as I said, it pays back during placement tests.\n└── Does it include coding? Or just pseudocodes like we had in DAA?"
