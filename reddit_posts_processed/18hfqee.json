I have no idea what the character certificate is but I know people who got caught cheating in exams peacefully sitting for placements and getting LORs. I don't think this is that serious or anything. About the phone call to your parents, explain it to them asap so that there's no misunderstanding and they know to expect it. Also get used to your parents getting calls from your mentor in your first year. It depends on the mentor but many of them try to keep your parents updated\n└── Finally a noteworthy comment for the query I quoted🙇‍♂️"
