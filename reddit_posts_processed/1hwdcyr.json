Wouldn't that include carrying around money for change which is a hassle? \n\nUPI would just need them to enter a value and show a QR\n│   │   ├── It's convenient because they take some of the cash for themselves at the end of the day lol\n│   │   │   └── Being the last stop, I can't even estimate how many times conductors have refused to give me change, claiming they didn't have any.\n│   │   │       └── True\n│   │   ├── After scanning and paying, the conductor should verify the UPI transaction ID in the ETM and then issue the ticket which becomes a hassle and time-consuming, that's why many of them avoid online payments\n│   │   ├── Apparently they cite reasons as \"poor internet connectivity\" and the fact that it takes too much time for them to verify aadhar cards and bus passes so they don't have the time to check if the UPI payments have gone through or not. Out of curiosity what was the bus fare when you began in 2018 lol\n│   │   └── its prolly cuz the buses are used by the poorer sections of society who wouldnt have UPI in their phones.\n│   └── It isn't available in 3/4 busses\n├── By mistake if u don't have the required change... U have to beg the  god to send the conductor back to you so that u can get back the remaining change....\n├── imagine being so jobless and lifeless that u comment on ur old college reddit\n└── for some reason even tho the normal buses have the same payment machines as the ones in malls, they refuse to use UPI.  Its not even a hardware issue."

Assuming you travel everyday, that's: \n\n₹15 per week or \n₹60 per month or\n₹720 per year\n    └── that's one way for me, so its really 1440 rupees every year... not happy"
