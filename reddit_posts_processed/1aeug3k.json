So you will need to pass it by retaking it during the summer or the next time it is offered, which is usually next year. You won't get a year back if you fail a single course. \n\n> what is the minimum passing sgpa\n\nThere is no \"passing\" SGPA. It does not work like that. You will graduate with a degree as long as you pass every course. So even if you score the lowest passing grade (E) in every course, you will get your degree.\n\nOn the other hand, if you want to know the minimum GPA to be eligible for placements, then I think its a 6.5 or 7.\n\nThere are more details about credits and backlogs (among other topics) on the [FAQs](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/14c1iym/faqs/)\n└── Unrelated but is cgpa just the average of all the sgpas?\n    └── It's a weighted average of SGPA, weighted by the credits per semester. Check the FAQ link I posted, there's a guide on how your CGPA is calculated.\n        └── Ty!"
