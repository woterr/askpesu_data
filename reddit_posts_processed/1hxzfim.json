CD was horror story\n    │   └── Yo why was CD horror? Can you elaborate?\n    │       └── Just extremely tedious man course content and personally was not a fan of the subject so maybe theres a bias. But yea if we go bu toughness its the worst in 6th sem\n    │           └── Was it mcq for you guys? We have been told that isa will be mcq and will be scaled down to 30.\n    │               └── Fr? Won't we have subjective 4 markers?\n    │                   └── That's what our teacher told us. But not sure.\n    └── Textbook is way too vast for physics sadly\n        └── Yeah as I said, nobody is expected to read the book in first year. I was just stating that the PPTs cannot be expected to cover the full book either, so there's always a chance of getting something beyond the slides because profs still use the book for questions."

      "body": "The ISA question was quite challenging. People are suggesting that, in addition to the slides, we should also refer to the book, which is a good idea. However, one question comes to mind: why is it that over 50% of the syllabus is covered in the first year, yet it contributes less than 5% to a career in CSE? Considering that PES University claims to be the No. 1 university in Karnataka, shouldn't they focus on a more practical, real-world-oriented syllabus? I’m not sure if my perspective is entirely correct, but it’s something to think about."
