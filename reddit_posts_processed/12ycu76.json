The questions won't be too hard and report length is also fairly short.\n\n\n7th sem is where you implement your project whether it's a software implementation or a hardware implementation is your call to take. You must write a paper on your project and try to get it published as well. The questions are a bit tougher but if you know what you're doing it's a walk in the park.\n└── Thank you bro"
