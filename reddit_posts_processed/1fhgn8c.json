It's only rv that's better than pes rr\nâ””â”€â”€ Only cs,is right not cse specs\n    â””â”€â”€ Depends on the goal, the cse degree is still better than the spec for masters/psu but if u are considering a job then it doesn't matter, so id say cse spec in rv is still better than pes rr considering the intake of pesu..\n        â””â”€â”€ But still cse spec won't have stats as good as rv cs,is ig\n            â””â”€â”€ The avg of rvce cse spec will be equal or slightly better than pes rr cse, so again it depends, cse degree is better than a cse spec and pes has a better infra than rv.. The only downside is intake id say\n                â””â”€â”€ One last question, how will cse spec affect options for masters\n                    â””â”€â”€ You should ask some senior for this, I basically have no idea abt this because I won't be doing masters\n                        â””â”€â”€ Oh ok"
