SWE, IS&T etc.?\n│       └── 9+\n├── Wait apple seriously came??

As in were there 40 openings or did they offer 64 lpa to 40 people? If it were true then it would have been all over the news by now\n            ├── ik of at least 23 people who got this offer, so yes good chance it happened for 40\nAlso I believe Apple has some kind of non-disclosure thing for recruitments in PESU, they don’t let the students publicly announce the offer and also PESU is not allowed to mention it for advertisement purposes. Probably this is the reason there isn’t much news.\n            └── Its 100% ture i know 20+ people personally who got the offer. And yes they took 40 people in total.\n                └── Won't this alone bump your average up by an insane amount? Do uk what the average package is currently?"
