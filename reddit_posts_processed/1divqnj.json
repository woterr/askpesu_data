  "content": "The website says 5 July is last date for original documents' submission. Do we have to go to Bangalore before 5 July to submit the documents? Coz dutring counselling they just asked for photocopies of original documents. \n\nAlso, do they just verify the documents or keep them? Coz I don't think UGC allows colleges to keep the original documents like marksheets and all.",

And yes, you need to submit them in person at the admission office in MRD, RR campus.\n\nCollege keeps all the original documents until the end of the first year, after which you can go and collect them."
