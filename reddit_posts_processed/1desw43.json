      "body": "If fees is not a problem 100 % go with RVCE or PES Aiml. Undergrad placements of AIML are exactly the same or might be better than CSE. So , if that's what you're concerned about then take this. And PES AIML syllabus is really good so u can check that out if you're concerned about academics too\n└── >Undergrad placements of AIML are exactly the same or might be better than CSE\n\nHow are you claiming this if the first batch of AIML just finished 2nd year?\n\n>PES AIML syllabus is really good\n\nAnd how are you claiming this too given that (1) core CS courses are being rushed/replaced with ML related coursework and (2) they have not planned out all 4 years yet?\n\nu/[Alternative\\_Pin\\_9298](https://www.reddit.com/user/Alternative_Pin_9298/), check out the post in the FAQs about CS vs CS+AIML: https://bit.ly/pesu-faq. It should answer most of your questions. TLDR, pick core CS always."

It’s definitely not worth it because you can’t have so many good companies recruiting 1000s of students. Rv cs or pes cs or pes aiml all 3 over vit any branch."
