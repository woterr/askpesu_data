That shit stops after sixth grade. \nI never maintained a single notebook and never will.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ This is true, but some lecturers may ask u if ur not noting it down despite informing u to do so, however such ppl r very less and they trouble much too\nâ””â”€â”€ Ehh, if u r in regular school, then u need to do it till 12th.Â \n    â””â”€â”€ Realistically you only have to maintain the physics lab file and Chem lab file. But again there are no notebook submissions."
