  "content": "I don’t even get peace in the hostel, and when I come to the library so I can study for these shitass exams, I see assholes talking at full volume like they’re in a fucking fishmarket\n\nGO OUTSIDE if you want to speak your stupid bullshit. There are so empty classrooms  after lunch break, yet you drag your loud, annoying asses here with your friends, boyfriends, girlfriends, or whatever the fuck pathetic group you roll in, acting like this place is some goddamn cafe.\n\nThis is a  LIBRARY, not your barnyard or personal playground. SHUT THE FUCK UP or get the hell out\n",
