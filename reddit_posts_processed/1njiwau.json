You can't fight it. While it sounds unethical in 2025, it's the only way to un-skew the ratio in the IT industry which has historically always been biased towards men and barely given women the same opportunities to succeed. 90% of the workforce is still dominated by men in all fields, this is the only way to correct the wrong. \n\nAs for (2), diversity hiring aside, that's the difference between absolute and relative performance.

Interviews, not sure. Cameras are always on during interviews here, so it does drastically reduce the ability to cheat. But of course, if cheaters are determined I am sure they will find a way out. One of the jokes in my friend circle is that cheaters are even better at cheating than we are at ML/SWE (since we are applying for these roles) lol.\n│       ├── I disagree with the reasoning as to why you think it's needed, but I'm not here to argue. \n\nJust glad to see it atleast being acknowledged. It's so much more annoying when people deny diversity hiring exists.\n\nThe company can literally tell men to not even apply, and there's still going to be people who say diversity hiring is a myth, and the best were chosen. \n\nA girl even told me that some companies reject men cause they're biologically inferior in communication and teamwork. And it's basically like a gpa shortlist. \n\nIt's a garbage clown world out there, there's no hope left\n│       │   ├── Again, you still haven't seen the workforce and how male-dominated it is. Inclusivity is important, and if you understood that, you'd also understand that companies need to take measures to implement it. Increasing the number of women being hired is the only way to balance the ratio, when historically it's always been men who have gotten hired. How else would you balance a ratio which is skewed? Fire the men lmao? That's a lawsuit. \n\nDiversity hiring definitely exists. And for a very good reason, and it's here to stay. And as a man, it's something I will 100% support. If you think it's not required, it's simply because you and everyone else in our generation simply didn't experience any bias against us based on our gender, unlike the generations before us. So no, demanding equal opportunities now doesn't actually make things equal, since it doesn't actually fix the mistakes made earlier. \n\nHowever, having said that, it's wrong that sometimes, companies make it obvious, sometimes, it's hidden from us. And that's where I agree with you that companies need to be more honest and upfront about this, since it wastes time/energy/resources of both parties. \n\nDiversity hiring is a good thing. It's not a \"garbage clown world\" move. If this feels like an inconvenience for you, you're just getting to feel how women felt years ago.\n│       │   │   └── Why is it important?

Why are you such a cuck that you'd be happy and \"100% supporting\" of a woman getting a job over you solely due to sex?\n\nIt's sad how society can make the people getting screwed over think they deserve it, and you're living proof of it. Keep it up champ\n│       │   │       ├── Most people like having some women in the team.

Those who are enraged in this current post are most probably going down your path.\n│       │   │       ├── >companies want larger profits. And why would anyone looking for profits, actively choose worse employees\n\n\nCompanies in India get tax benefits for hiring more women. The main reason they like to do diversity hiring is for profit\n│       │   │       └── Because you're being a dick to me and women actively trying to find their place amongst men in a male-dominated field, let me break it down for you, because you clearly do not know what diversity hiring is about. I'm not going to respond to any more comments to this, at least from you, cause you are clearly not a human worth my time and effort.\n\n\\---\n\n  \nSTEM fields have been male-dominated for decades, not because men are inherently better (which you wildly and blatantly assume), but because systemic barriers made it harder for women (and other groups) to get the same opportunities: networking, mentorship, hiring, promotions, etc. Diversity hiring isn’t about hiring \"unqualified\" people, but rather, it’s about ensuring qualified candidates from all *backgrounds* have a fair shot, and fixing decades of systemic bias. Women have historically been denied these opportunities, and ignoring that history doesn’t make the field fair; it preserves inequality without a solution.\n\nWhen a company prioritizes diversity, they are usually still hiring highly competent people *within* that group (or at least that is the aim; I am going to ignore the cheating problem here since it's not relevant to our discussion). Diverse teams are better because different perspectives spark innovation, challenge existing assumptions, prevent groupthink, and improve problem-solving. They create more user-friendly, inclusive products and make better decisions overall. All of these help the company way more than you think. \n\nAlso, calling me a “cuck” for supporting women getting fair opportunities is pathetic. Supporting fairness, correcting unfir bias, and recognizing competence isn’t weakness, it’s called having principles and common sense. Throwing insults doesn’t make your argument stronger; it just exposes how entitled and insecure you are about the topic. The fact that you see it as some kind of threat shows exactly why diversity hiring is needed. Despite you claiming that you want the better person to be hired, you lose your cool when a man actually backs equality. This is the kind of bias and stereotype that diversity hiring aims to fix.\n\nIf you feel this is unfair, congratulations, buddy! You’re now getting a tiny taste of what women have been dealing with for decades. And seriously, do better. I hope nobody looks up to you as a mentor, because no matter how skilled you are at LC or your job, you’re a complete garbage human being. Complain about diversity hiring all you want, but it exists precisely because of people like you in the past: entitled, self-absorbed, and oblivious, who made it necessary in the first place.\n│       │   │           └── bro respecfully what does systemic barriers actually mean, please lemme know, bro i can name people who actually did'nt do shit in the whole college and in that list, so when you see this happening people generally get frustrated, and bro like unqualified people were hired take it  from me, and also some of them are great I know them personally, and then companies like google do hire competent people be it girls or boys but these  companies like ibm they set the bar lower, and bro like diverse people make grea discussions I don't knwo bro i feel that competency comes from your own ability, if the student can't pass the exam and you have a quota for them, then does'nt mean you  make the paper easy for them, you need to improve ability and people with that ability get frustrated because they knew it, that they have the ability to do it, and they were not taken, and bro like you were talking about discrimination against girls, bro you are in pes, everyone here is fuckin privileged to pay that fees and come to college, fuckin tell those fuckers to hire from a remoter area or actually unprivileged background   and then say that some disparity they are bridging not this white washing bull shit, so yeah again respectfully please lemme know, just trying to have a respectful conversation\n│       │   └── I'm a girl and I have a relative from a core engineering background and those domains genuinely need more women.\n\nI'd say to some extent it's also the same for women in CS too, but it's not the same way it is in core engineering. In fact, girls are interested in CS. The efforts should instead be redirected towards retaining women in CS- being more understanding about periods, supporting women through changing priorities, pregnancies and so on. I remember my grandfather(who's quite liberal; my mother works full-time) telling me that a man's career goes on until he's forced to retire due to age. A woman's career goes on until she's forced to retire because she can't take it anymore because she's effectively juggling two jobs at once. \n\nA lot of girls get branded as diversity hires even if they worked their ass off for a job. If it's not outright stated, people still assume that \"all the guys got filtered out in the earlier stages\". We don't like it either.\n│       │       ├── I understand, there's tons of girls who worked just as hard for a job. I'm not trying to say women are inherently worse, or better. I'm just saying sex based discrimination is wrong, and it takes a morally bankrupt person to do it. \n\nLet's take the ibm situation \n\n1. There's many many more boys than girls in the college. \n2. They literally put the word \"diversity\" next to every female, and \"non-diversity\" next to every guy's name. \n3. 42 people passed the hr round, and ibm took their biometrics. \n4. About 10 (max 15) of the 42 were girls \n5. They finally selected 10 people for the job. Of which 8 were girls. \n\nany reasonable person can see it. And it's very very common. \n\nEven a 50-50 hire is definitely discrimination cause the vast majority of applications were from men. \n\npeople still \"assume\" that cause that's what's going on. Men are actively being discriminated against. How can you have any closure that the hiring was fair when your application literally has \"non-diversity\" attached to it?\n\nObviously every woman ever hired wasn't a diversity hire, but right now a good number are. And all I'll say is that for a lot of illogical people, this will be a source of resentment towards women. \n\nAnd before the whiners call me names, I don't blame the women being diversity hires. We should all take the opportunities given to us regardless of how we get them. I resent the people giving out the special treatment, not the ones getting it.\n│       │       └── I don't get why anyone would type out essays for IBM. IBM is known for it and they are doing it as well. Just accept it and move on, don't think it would make everyone this mad. \n\nI don't think these guys have the same reaction for other companies as well. So a lot of girls aren't getting branded as diversity hires.\n│       └── Same MO. It's not diversity hiring and if it was, here's my long para on why it's needed.\n├── when there was a colum dedicated for diversity/non diversity we know where its headed\n├── Really?
