Cause many people got good SGPAs this sem also, any type of estimate will help\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ It was very inflated !! They gave literally one extra grade in Math Sem 2 and even C Programming Others were relative except Electrical  \nYou can expect this Semester 3 and Semester 5 cutoff to be 9 this time\nâ””â”€â”€ Hi..If Iâ€™m aiming for MRD in 3rd and 4th sem, do my 1st and 2nd sem GPAs count? Theyâ€™re in the 7.5â€“8 range, so am I already cooked or still in the game?\n    â””â”€â”€ Yeah youâ€™re cooked buddy. No way youâ€™re getting that 50% back. Assuming you have 8 in both sem 1 and sem 2 (which you donâ€™t), even if you score perfect 10 in both sems to get your CGPA to 9.04 even then you wonâ€™t get the MRD scholarship. You can aim for CNR tho since itâ€™s on the basis of SGPA and not CGPA. If u score a sgpa 8.6-8.7, you should be fine but there have been some exceptional cases (like the sem when I asked this question) the cutoff was 8.83 and it was even 9 for some seniorsâ€¦ so according to other peopleâ€™s performance it varies but in normal scenarios, 8.6-8.7 or anything above it will get your CNR\n        â””â”€â”€ Yeah, cooked is right.. I kinda knew MRD was out of reach, but was still hoping for a miracle.Â Thanks for the clarity though, Iâ€™ll aim for CNR then.Â "
