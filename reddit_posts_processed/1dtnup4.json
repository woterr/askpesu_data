Only print the fee payment receipt\n\nIf you're doing it online, you can't view the paper. You only get to pay the 1000 for re-eval. You have to mail it to the coe office and attach the receipt. I'm not too sure about the online process so I'd probably check with someone before sending the mail. Just ask in your friend group or batch's WhatsApp group\n└── Thank you.\n\nAnd do you have any idea how long they take generally to release the re eval results?\n    └── A couple of weeks"
