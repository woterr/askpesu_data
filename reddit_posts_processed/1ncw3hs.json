  "content": "I received a mail regarding the minor course and I chose DSA. However, the syllabus is the same as what I had in the 1st semester (MCA), and I am currently in the 3rd semester. The classes for the minor course start at 4:30 PM, while my regular classes end at 1 PM. I would like to remove the minor course from my PESU Academy as well. Could someone please advise me on how to proceed? (Apologies if my wording is not the best.)",
