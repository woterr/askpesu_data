(Not 100% sure)\n\n\nMaaya and aathmatrisha take place around 6 months apart. I forget the months.\n└── Adding on, I don't think any *big* club in RR atleast allow EC campus people to join, because almost all events happen offline here and it will be hard to travel from there to here for just club events\n    └── Yup that's true. At most some coding/ CS related clubs might allow."
