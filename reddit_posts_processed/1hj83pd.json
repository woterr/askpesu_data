GGs\n    â””â”€â”€ Well ig that's a good tradeoff, but yeah our placements are a bit worser than u guysðŸ˜­\n        â””â”€â”€ Well life gives and takes , i see other colleges and get really jealous sometimes too. Very difficult to get a good gpa here , comparatively. PES also somewhat encourages a coaching culture over interests. But it is what it is ig.\n            â””â”€â”€ Yea ikðŸ˜ž,good luck being there bro"

I would avoid messing with u, gud luck carrying that hate  :)\n        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ It's up to you, man. I never forced you to talk to me. If you're genuinely offended by differing political views, that says more about you than anything else. Also, I don't hate any religion or anything like thatâ€”my username was just a harmless joke.\n        â”‚       â””â”€â”€ \"Offended\" bro your entire post history is just you arguing politicsðŸ˜­  and I remember you were the one whining under some post in this subreddit about a poor student from a village\n        â””â”€â”€ Bohut cool ban gaya bhai"

Or is given in kind support?\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Yes they do take equity ,max I heard was of 25%\nâ””â”€â”€ they take equity ofcourse, but more than that if your startup is damn well successful, they will milk it for the next upcoming 25 years\n    â””â”€â”€ have they milked anything till now.\n        â””â”€â”€ dude this guy got placed in 2021 for 1.5 cr and mfs are still milking his placement."
