You didn't even change the content.\n\nEC campus has been described in detail across many posts, just search through this subreddit instead of making (multiple) duplicate posts. Here are some posts to start with:\n\n* [Pros and Cons of PES](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/13ygg68/comment/jmmro6e)\n* [EC campus Infra](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/1cpg2rr/comment/l3kjuvl/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n* [PES EC CS vs BMSCE CS](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/1d5lhr7/bmscecse_vs_pes_ec_campuscse/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) (literally your question, next time search the subreddit)\n└── and see the replies they gave in that last link of pes vs bms , go checkout and give me the answer for question , u wont find it\n    └── What answers are you looking for? The first comment on that link says BMSCE is better. Read the same thread - the commenter has added details about lower fees, placements and infrastructure. \n\nDid you even read through all the links? Plus, I asked you to search for relevant posts. Al the answers you are looking for have been addressed multiple times."
