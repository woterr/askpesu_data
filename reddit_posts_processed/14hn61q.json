      "body": "I m not sure if pesu bms and msrit come under t2....\n├── Ye like I said considering only for CSE it definitely is...\n└── Are they 3\n    ├── For other branches they would be lower Tier 2 to 3 ig but CSE is definitely up there in T2\n    │   └── You think only placement is the main factor for college Tier? \n\nAlumni network , exposure , in campus opportunities , professor quality etc is what make a college Tier 1 or 2 . \n\nPes is no way in the same league as LNMIIT, MANIPAL , THAPAR , RVCE ETC  . Not even close  .\n\nIt's a top Tier 3 at best.\n\nLooks like it's made to cope lol. These colleges Tiers don't mean much . Just work hard and you'll be able to compete with the so called highest tier students . Take it from a senior at one of these Tier 2\n    │       └── I agree that LNMIT is quite better than other colleges in this list but I disagree that the likes of RVCE,Manipal and Thapar are \"leagues\" better than PESU.PESU is the second choice for CSE right behind RVCE in KCET,have arguably better campus and we have really good alumni network as well.Professor quality is not as good as it was in its prime but thats the case for RVCE and Thapar as well which I have heard from my friends.There are people who have left mid NITs and several ppl in 98-99 % range who have taken admit in PESU.Even in this subredddit too there are people asking to choose between circuital branches in both colleges. As for Thapar it has been on a steady decline for some years now but I have still placed them above RVCE (which is the best college in Karnataka through either KCET or COMEDK).\n\nAll in all These colleges can be considered as Tier 2 but I have ranked them appropriately in their Tier Range as you can see.And no this list was not made for cope but rather to help the people in this subreddit to be able to select colleges properly without bias since I couldnt find a decent list anywhere.\n\nThank you for your patient reading.\n    │           └── Ok maybe leagues above was a harsh word but do you seriously think RV CSE , Manipal CSE and Thapar CSE are equal to PES CS? Since you seem to be only comparing CS in each campus ?\n\nRV reportedly had 16L avg for CS this year . Manipal and Thapar are the same . I don't think PES is even close .\n\nAlso isn't the KCET hierarchy RV >BMS>MSRIT>PES? \nI don't know even one person who took PES over BMS . Maybe MSR but even then it's rare  . PES is known to be strict like a school and people avoid it . Also idk who are these 98-99 people who leave IIITs and come to PES lol .\n\nLike i said , it's not that deep .  Placements aren't the only thing in college . If you count only Placements , then sure , I'd say PES CS is Tier 2 provided you show me some source that PES CS avg placement are above 15L atleast . Because for all the colleges you're comparing PES with , they are .( Except VIT)\n    │               ├── In this subreddit itself u can see someone has posted the stats from uni...PESU has CSE avg of 18 lakhs and median of 10-12 range.For CSE pretty sure the KCET order is RV>PES>BMS>MSR. It was strict under VTU regime but its slowly  but surely becoming more liberal.Only reason the subreddit is so negative about PESU is cause of the immense workload,poor mgmnt ,poor campus life and poor labs. Other factors are also comparable with the clgs U hav mentioned which u can confirm with any student here.\n    │               │   └── Good then . PES CS is Tier 2 . The entire college though idk\n    │               └── Kcet hierarchy is RV > PES > BMS > MSRIT, despite PES having a huge CS batch, I chose PES over BMS and MSRIT. Also I would, after being here for 2 years would say PES CSE > RVCE CSE. The peer group, opportunities and the exposure you get here are much better than RV\n    │                   └── Well it might be . When i was taking admission last year I had CS options in all the ones you mentioned above and Manipal CS . PES wasn't even in my list since I automatically ruled it out for small campus size and I consulted seniors who told me to stay away from PES . So for me and some of my friends it was mainly between RV CS and Manipal CS . In the end I got a scholarship at Manipal and went there for CS.\n\nI don't think anybody's choosing PES CS over RV . RV is much more established and is basically like a Tier 1 in Bangalore . PES isn't that good .\n\nBut again I'm arguing here in the pes sub lol . It's pointless\n    │                       ├── I agree Manipal and RV CSE is currently better than PES but not by a huge margin..ie I have clubbed them together in one tier but ranked PES the lowest in that tier...Hope that helps\n    │                       └── Well, removing PES from your list and choosing between RV and Manipal was your own personal choice and great if it suits you. My reply was only for Banglore KCET colleges I never talked about Manipal, First you said nobody would choose PES over BMS and MSRIT, when I pointed that out, you got humbled and now you are saying nobody would choose PES over RV. Speak for yourself I have friends who have chosen PES over RV. If you look at the sub you see many people against PES, so dont worry about bias against your opinion.\n    └── No both are tier 2"

Even if we consider that they both are same today, the location factor, low fees and strict curriculum(it might be a negative for some people because they like to chill, but college should be ranked on the basis of academics, not how much u can chill. If college life is considered a basis for rating, IIIT H would be really low, but it has THE BEST CSE program all over india) gives rvce a really good edge over thapar\n│   │           ├── You have a point I have fixed it now kindly check now\n│   │           └── i wished someone actually made a list on \"college life\"\n│   └── I have placed them in the correct order in the same tier range from top to down.\n└── Noted.Will edit soon.\n    └── BTW, ik patna might not be the ideal location for people outside of bihar(or even for people from bihar).

Atleast imo, it deserves to either be in the lowest position of 1.7 tier or top position of 2.1 tier\n        └── That might be true but I have only heard negative reviews from ppl in the know how from NIT Patna apart from placements...Maybe in future if it develops I might place it higher...\n            └── negative as in?"
