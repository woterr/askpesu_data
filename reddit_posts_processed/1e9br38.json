Lmao.\n\nAll incoming PESts' parents are sent an email in the first month or so about their children taking part in illegal activities and parties and to keep an eye on their children. It's a canon event. If someone has, they can paste the email here for you to read.\n└── wth?? what is the management trying to achieve with that-\n    └── Scare your parents into thinking that their children are involved in illegal activities. \n\nBut yeah, that's the sad state of affairs here. As we said before, this is advanced schooling, not college."

      "body": "Dear Students and Parents,\n\n\n\nIt has come to our notice that a group of students claiming to be higher semester students are hosting a 'Freshers' Party', in private places. \n\n\n\nPlease note that all such activities are illegal and have no approval from the University.\n\n\n\nPlease do not be part of such activities which could put you in a wrong group and lead you to a situation of no return. Such activities are normally organised by a set of people trying to collect money from gullible students and in places which are unsafe and dangerous.\n\n\n\nWe have noticed such activities in the past and have reported the same to the concerned authorities, who have taken effective steps to stop them from happening, where our own students would land up as victims.\n\n\n\nThe Vice-Chancellor, Registrar and Dean, Student Affairs, PES University, have been informed about this activity. Parents are also informed, to inform their wards to stay away from such activities.\n\n\n\nStay informed, keep away from these nefarious activities and stay safe.\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nPES University\n\n\n\n\nPadh le beta\n├── huge L\n├── but fr tho is there any unofficial freshers party or any unofficial parties at all\n│   └── No one from the college is gonna give you freshers party not even unofficially so don't keep hopes\n│       ├── yeah thought so\n│       └── They used to ,strange that now seniors are also hesitating to throw for juniors\n└── Funnily enough they had sent the exact same message to my parents back in 2022"
