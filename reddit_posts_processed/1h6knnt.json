Don't worry everything will be told during the session.\nâ””â”€â”€ OK but y is it named so ?\n    â””â”€â”€ Like it is easy to peel a banana, so it is called banana problem which means that the assignment is easy to solve\n        â”œâ”€â”€ OK got it..\n        â””â”€â”€ I can't tell if you're joking ðŸ˜­\n            â””â”€â”€ No I'm not ðŸ˜‚. Orange problems are medium difficulty because they are harder to peel than bananas and jackfruit problems are the hardest because it is very hard to cut open a jackfruit."
