You should choose what benefits your career the most. If you are into sports, your friends cannot play the game for you lol.\n        ├── Yeah I agree. But when there's no clear winner (atleast to me) these factors should also be considered. RV does have a smaller batch size but PES is still on even footing with it in terms of placements (for the options that are available to me) and I definitely prefer the PES campus which again isn't a factor for most people but it is to me. Now I don't know if others opinions really help but after fucking everything up, I atleast wanna make the right decision here.\n        └── Also I really appreciate the input"
