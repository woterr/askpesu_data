And on top of  that, that English professor or should I say bitch asked why is this guy not coming since 2 classes and when students told her she mockingly laughed and said ohh that’s why hahaha. All of them are insensitive sadist losers and I wish somebody recorded the HODs words and made it viral\n\nQuoted from one of the comments under that post"

I have not followed up on what's happened but saying \"its on them\" is insensitive as fuck."
