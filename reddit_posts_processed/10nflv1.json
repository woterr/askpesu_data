      "body": "Once you get your credentials, or you can use \n\nusername: your\\_srn, password: pesit, like the other redditor said. \n\n1. log on to [http://www.library.pes.edu/opac/default.aspx](http://www.library.pes.edu/opac/default.aspx) with those creds\n2. go to the **\"Search\"** tab on the top horizontal bar\n3. In the **\"Category\"** section, switch to **\"Digital Library\"**. Do not forget to do this step as this will be helpful to filter out only ESA papers\n4. in the **Title** section, give in the course name. Usually with this you get all papers. but you may also get with your course code. Just remove the UEYY part and give in only whats after that. eg: CS345/MA201 etc. \n5. Hit \"**Search**\", and youll get a bunch of results. Click on \"**Download**\" to get a link to a pdf. save these to a notepad or something. Next time you wanna access these papers, you just have to click on these links, no need of even logging in xD\n├── Thank you so much!!\n└── what is the meber id and password"
