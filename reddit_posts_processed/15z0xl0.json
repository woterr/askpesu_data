Nothing specific unless you are doing some high level coding\n2. yes, its hectic, but maybe due to 2-ISA system you may feel it less hectic, and its tougher atleast in 2nd year imo\n3. Only Wednesday and Friday till 1pm\n└── Coz I like it and I heard the pay's good if you remain in core ece\n    └── oh okay"
