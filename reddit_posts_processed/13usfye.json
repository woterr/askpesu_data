  "content": "So I applied for bsc psychology and i know I gave a terrible interview they preponed the interview and notified me 30 min before, the problem was there was no current=no net\n\nI broke my phone yesterday and the new one was supposed to arrive by 9:00 pm so I was using a jio phone and i panicked a lot because my brother can't come quickly because it was raining\n\nBut the Amazon came just then I got into my new phone and downloaded zoom and by the time I was ready it was 30 min into it apparently i was the last one left \n\nWhich stressed me a lot and the result was terrible, did anyone get in even though they gave a bad interview or can I attend the interview again",

A friend of mine didn't even attend the interview and he still got in lol. Not sure how the system is now but when I joined, the interview was (as I said) for official purposes only."
