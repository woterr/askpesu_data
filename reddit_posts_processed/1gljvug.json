Anyway I look forward to maaya as yesterday's Kannada koota event UTSAVA2K24 was a banger.\n├── What's your rank on valo?\n└── Maaya's management ain't bad, we had everything planned but the PES management screwed over their own, they banned banner didn't let us get it printed, they said no attendance compensation for the volunteers and worst of all exactly 2 days after banning printed banners there was a huge ass pesu 18 banner there, so you should blame ecc management not the volunteers or heads as they've poured all the blood and sweat they've got to make this a success."
