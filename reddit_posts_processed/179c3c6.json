      "body": "For mechanical engineering, the book by kr gopalakrishna is very good , it has really good explanations and helped me a lot . You should find it in the library , otherwise you can obtain a pdf of the same online.\n\nFor physics just refer to the notes you made in class on the basis of whatever you understood . Pesu notes should also suffice but it mainly depends in how much you've understood in class.\nDon't even bother opening the physics textbook , total waste of time and nothing will go into your head .\n\nMaths also again just focus on class work problems and notes that you've made in the class , cuz questions in both isa as well as esa will be similar to those done in class , very very similar .\nIf you are done with cw problems and are confident in theory , move to pesu academy question bank and solve each and every question there .\nThis should set you up for ISA and upto some extent an A grade in esa , but for S grade , you will need to refer to the textbook during the esa period .\nFor isa , tb is not necessary for maths ."
