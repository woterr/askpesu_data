He takes a much softer stance now (afaik, I spoke to him abt it) after the syllabus was released. Core is still better but by a small margin\n                └── oh that's reassuring thank you"

Though they look at courses as well, the paper said that it isn’t heavily criticised, but that it’s important to take harder classes and do well in them.\n\nSo if you love maths and are genuinely interested in aiml, then just go for it, otherwise choose core cse."
