      "body": "It is very unlikely that anyone fails here actually. Yes it does happen, but its probably 1-3 students per course at most. Theoretically, most people almost pass with just ISA and assignment scores (assignment is a 10 at least and ISAs add up to 40, so people usually get 25+ at least in this score, thus meaning you need 20 marks in ESA to cross the pass mark). it takes only a little more effort to actually barely pass. Everyone passes, don't worry about failing unless you have not done anything in assignments, or ISAs and have completely screwed up your ESA. Its easier to pass than to screw up all the possible components."
