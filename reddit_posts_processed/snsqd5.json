      "body": "What info are you looking for? Credits correspond to the number of hours of class you have in a week. A 4 credit theory course means 4 hours of lectures. For Lab courses it's 2 hours per credit. Projects have a different allocation based on the \"recommended\" number of hours. \n\nYour GPA is calculated by using the weighted average grade point based on the credits of the course. \n\nThe system is meant to be \"flexible\" but you can't really drop courses like you can in foreign universities. You need a specific number of credits to graduate (in my year it was 176). The only plus side is that you can do some summer courses and internships for credits, and those let you skip some classes in the final year."
