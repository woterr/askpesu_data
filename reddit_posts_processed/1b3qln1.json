This is based on your sgpa\n\nLastly, everyone who got above 7.75 will get DLC. This is 2k regardless\n├── 90k per Sem ? Or 90k per year ? \nAnd what is the respective cut offs for \nMRD and CNR (CGPA cut offs )\n│   └── Per sem.\n\nBro it's not a cutoff. It depends on how other people do in the exams\n├── Yeah but they interchanged the name for both of them\n├── Top 2% get CNR, right?\nTop 20% is MRD\n│   └── Not anymore. It's top 5 and remaining 20. So a total of 25 Percent get one of the two\n└── What do cst and pessant mean\n    └── Cet and pessat lol"
