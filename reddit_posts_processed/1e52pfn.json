      "body": "The issue with electives at PES is that the difficulty keeps changing. Sometimes they're easy, sometimes they're difficult. It's very unpredictable. It depends on the batch and also the paper that year. \n\nHCI as a course is pretty bland if you're not interested in it. It's entirely theoretical, but it's easy-to-memorise theory. ISAs/ESA  questions are basically quoting content from slides - there is no application of knowledge here. So it's basically an either you-know-the-answer-or-you-don't kind of paper. If you memorise well, you can score well. But if you're someone who cannot memorise large chunks of info, then you'll struggle. \n\nIn my year, it was pretty easy. But then the year after mine it became really difficult. Then it was easy again for a year."
