Everyone got a .5 to 1 increase\n\nWtf is this ec campus supremacy\n├── Oh wow, why can't they do it for RR too?!?!\n│   └── Because you got the correct marks, everyone's marks here were very low as it wasn't correct\n└── Nah there was like a legit discrepancy, people who usually get 9 ended up with a 7 or 8\n    └── That happened in rr campus too right\n        └── Not really. Everybody ik got a little less than what they got in the last sem. But EC peeps afaik got way lesser and ig they didn't do any moderation for them and consequently they had to take the provisional results back.."

They need to make relative the  norm, with absolute being used only for certain courses."
