First year subjects are not even that hard.\nâ””â”€â”€ exactly that is the problem its easy and i didnt study enough , but if i do isa 2 and esa good is  maintianing gpa still fine coz i got a reality check now..... also i heard is i skip isa 1 isa 2 marks r considered for both is it true\n    â””â”€â”€ >i heard is i skip isa 1 isa 2 marks r considered for both is it true\n\nFalse\n        â”œâ”€â”€ so whats the thing if someone misses any isa\n        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ You get a 0. Which means you've lost 20 marks out of 100 already.\n\nJust go write whatever you know. Getting 5 marks is better than getting a 0.\n        â””â”€â”€ I honestly don't know where people hear such stuff from lol"
