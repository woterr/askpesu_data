I've even tried sending a mail to the email address, but i haven't gotten any response.\n\nwhere am i supposed to go to enquire about this?",

It's the stupidest thing pes has done.. especially if you are in CS like I am, I legit couldn't log in to do assignments and stuff cause there are 720 people in my batch, 1000+ in my junior batch and the device allotment was only 800 before.. if you have a vi sim card it works on most rooms and jus stick to data.. otherwise ggwp"
