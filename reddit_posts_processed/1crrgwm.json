  "content": "Every day I hear a new person has committed suicide in this college. People just come here to get degree, there is no need for strict and rude behaviour, it's just 4 years, just let people pass by, why torture each other, be it teachers to students or students to other students or maybe even students to teachers. As far I know I have heard 5 suicides in this college overall.",

Such trashed up minds these people have to screw up the minds of others."
