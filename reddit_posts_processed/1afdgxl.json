Coz I applied for reval and the grade changed a year back (Jan '23). They've been telling they'll give the refund. But nothing has happened yet. \n\nDo u know who to approach for this ??\n│           └── I didn't apply for re-evaluation last year and therefore didn't get any refund .\n\nHowever , i think you should approach the accounts section and enquire about the same .\n├── Thanks sm\n└── Also do they tell us how much we got on 100 or do we have to pay 100 bucks to see that\n    ├── Yeah even i'd like to know my marks\n    └── You pay 100 for script review , which means they'll show your paper which also includes your marks\n        └── So they don’t tell us our marks unless we pay 100 for script review?\n            └── Yeah you gotta pay in order to view your marks"
