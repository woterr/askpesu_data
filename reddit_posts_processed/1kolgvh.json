But now slowly im building confidence and am hitting the gym so like yeah, getting better. But the thing is 1st year ends in like 2 weeks, and then we move to our own branches, and like im pretty sure there arent girls in ECE. So my doubt is like will you still have contact with other branch people after first year? or do we become isolated with only our branch people? ",
