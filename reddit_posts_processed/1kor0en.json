Never have I ever agreed with the difficulty on a subject's paper with a cse friend, mutually exclusive difficulty all the time\n├── it's not about who bothered checking last year’s paper, the issue is that you guys literally got a recycled paper when we got a much harder one. And this has been a consistent pattern since the 3rd sem so I dare say it isn't a coincidence.\n\nYour ISAs and ESAs for MPCA and CN were objectively easier, and these are the 5 credit courses, so obviously that makes a difference\n\nYou’re right about the relative grading part, but it’s ridiculous to make one branch’s paper significantly harder in the first place. We walk out of exams disappointed and demoralized, it's fucking exhausting.\n│   └── The recycled paper was available in the last 2 days only, our ISAs were horrendous, they fucked up 40% of our grade and gave us a chance in the 50%\n│       └── They didn't even give us a chance in the 50%😭\n├── speaking of library , it wasnt even there until few days before the exam.  \nI downloaded all the 9 papers from the website 3 weeks before the ESA ( approx 1 week before isa2 )  \nBut my friend who downloaded 4-5 days before esa had 2 extra papers.  \nSo definitely < 20 people had that paper.  \nIt wasnt in any anchor pyq drive nor was it on any student shared pyq drives.\n\nCN papers werent really that hard for ISA atleast, it is the other papers where we will lose marks as CN corrections are chill for AIML to some extent compared to OS/MPCA\n└── It’s like all the shit u read is soooo useless in front of the actual paper\nFor CN this time , it was sooo very appln based , some questions genuinely had nothing to do with what we read in slides\nHow do u expect us to know all that??😭"

If you ask AIML folks, they’ll probably say  **CSE** papers looked easier to them too — it’s all about perspective.\n\nAlso, about the CN paper — not everyone even knew it was from last year’s ESA. And even if some questions were recycled, the paper was **challenging ... lengthy too..** not a free GPA boost. This semester’s ISAs weren’t exactly easy for us either. Every stream has its own struggles. Instead of comparing, let’s just focus on doing our best 🤝"
