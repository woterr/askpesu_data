  "content": "Are there direct BMTC buses available from EC campus or bus stop near EC campus (Konappana Agrahara) to RR campus? If yes, would they be available early morning? Considering all the campus placements interviews are being held in RR campus and some of them would require us to report at 9:00 A.M., I was wondering if taking bus would be convenient for me(final year student).",

These buses come every 10 minutes, and take an hour.\nThen at the Banashankari bus station, you board a 410 or MF-13 to PES college. These buses come every 10 minutes, and take 25 minutes. \n\nAnd go back the same way. \nFare will be ₹20+₹15.\nGood luck dude!"
