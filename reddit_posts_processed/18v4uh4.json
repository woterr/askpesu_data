Maths will be moderate. \n\nWork on numericals in mechanics (ESA will be \\*HARD\\*)\n\nConstitution will be easy, remember dates , majority of the questions are based on important dates.\n├── Mechanics do we have all the questions from textbook or questions can be asked from external resources?(for ESA)\n│   ├── Until last sem mechanics questions came only from the list provided however there were discussions about changing that…best to confirm with your own faculty (most in ec campus will gladly help you)\n│   └── Only textbook , but they might change the values..\n└── Duh , mechanics esa is hard ?  Isa is easy and esa is hard ? . Bro that's the only subject I have confidence in . Others subjects isa I've scored 18, 20 but mechanics is 29 and 32.\n    └── I had 49/50 in isa so.. yeah Isa's were cake walk for me but esa was difficult considering we had proofs and stuff\n        └── makes sense , thanks"
