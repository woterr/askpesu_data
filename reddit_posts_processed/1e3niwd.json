It's such a good college. There's no two ways about it.\n\nBut but but, PES is also a good college, it's not on the same level as PEC but it's not that far behind imo. It is situated in Bangalore.\n\nCurrently, I'm leaning a bit towards PES.\n\nThe admission list for PEC will be releasing on 22nd I think, if i get admission into CSE core or even a good specialisation, then what should I do. Keep in mind I am still leaning towards PES. I'm uploading my doubt here just to get some advice.",

For future ms prospects, nobody cares. Either way, most of the teachers won't be that great. \n\nJust pick the one that's more convenient. Or if you like infrastructure or something like that, pick based on that. If you play a particular sport, choose the college that has the court for it. \n\nIt won't matter much whichever college you choose, like i said choose based on your convenience\n└── I agree with a part of what he's trying to say but what he doesn't realize is that pec falls in the category of good colleges (your nits dtus and whatever) obviously lower than some of the top nits and bits but it's still a part of the same league. \nYou ask any gen x or millennial guy he'd tell you the same thing. "

PES is good but PEC is better. you'll save money there too plus the placements are awesome too and MS prospects are as good too.\n└── PEC also conducts counselling for categories like defense wards, kashmiri students, sportspersons etc.\n    └── aah interesting... didn't know about that"
