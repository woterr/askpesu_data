On the topic of electives, is there any place I can check what electives are available and suggestions on good electives would be greatly appreciated. \nI want to know what Icand choose with a clear understanding before going in blind and picking a minor or elective that looks interesting. Help is greatly appreciated because I'm in the thick of it rn. (Sorry) ",
