If you clear them, you should be eligible again. \n\nSomeone correct me if I'm wrong.\n└── If the source is rowlet owl, I think it’s sorted.\nI remember my senior Advaith mentioning that if you get a backlog you won’t be eligible for scholarship throughout the course or something like that.\n    └── I love the trust you have in me but I'd still recommend confirming this with the COE or someone else. But I believe whatever I mentioned is mostly right."
