      "body": "I'd say it depends on you and the mode of travel. It used to take me the same time one way to travel to RR campus, but I depended on the metro because my home is < 3km from a purple line metro station. So while the travel was long, there was always a convenient mode of travel I could depend on without any hassle. I even used to catch up on sleep during the metro ride. \n\nIf you are travelling on your own by driving or taking something like a bus/auto I'd suggest you to try it for a semester and then decide if you can sustain it for 2.5 more years.\n└── even i will be travelling by metro . Home is ~ 2km to purple line metro\n    └── Metro is chill dude. Try it for a semester and see how it goes"
