(3.5L for bms college of engineering if I recall)\n├── When management is lesser than pessat fee 💀\n│   ├── It's like a 10k difference but still less 👍\n│   └── Lol if I recall in PES itself the difference between management and pessat fee for mechanical is around 50k~\n└── I am eligible for BMSCE as well through comedk, as of now I've kept it in my list along with MSRIT"
