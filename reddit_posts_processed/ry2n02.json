As per the latest announcement made by the Government of Karnataka.\n└── But the cases are increasing , so it's gotta mean something to govt.\n    └── Yes the cases are increasing rapidly but due to low hospitalisation rate the government is a little unsure about the lockdown and shutting down of colleges. But PESU has so many students so it’s a little risky for students to attend physical classes.\n        └── Yeah PESU has more density compared to other colleges in bangalore"
