  "content": "is anyone aware about which transcripts or certifications or whatever they will ask us to present? i dont have any of my school exam answer sheets. and do  your grades on them matter once u qualify the minimum criteria in your 12th board exam? tho results for it arent out yet. when you apply on their site they instantly prompt you to pay 1200 inr before letting us know about anything else. i want to just check in with others about the details for the admission before i pay. thanks will appreciate any help.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m4n18wb7agse1.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&s=929bec26db19a695b899d8f6141b54710045a1e8\n\n",
