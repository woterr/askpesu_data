(so far)\n    └── I think much better since last yr in August ibm came and hired like 140 people itself whereas this isn't the case this yr - correct me if I am wrong though\n        └── nah its worse than last yr.  \nLast yr many companies came in the first 2-3 weeks itself and about 100 were hired during that time.  \nTotal Eligible students this time are approx 1800 and only about 200 including summer internship ppos are placed\n\nOfc out of that 1800 many arent eligible for most T1 companies which set gpa cutoffs  \nand some go for higher studies.\n            ├── Yeah that's a point that people sitting for placements this time is greater than last time...\n            └── Oh yeah makes sense the amt of people this time are more... But yeah many companies which hired last yr are hiring more people this yr like jpmc/meesho/couchbase,etc"
