  "content": "\nHey there!\nSee, recently they sent us a form to enroll to these special topics and the last date to enroll is 28th of this month. But they also mentioned that for the course to take place there should be minimum 30 students. But my concern is that suppose i enroll for one of the special topics and it turns out that there's not enough students enrolled in it and it gets cancelled,will I get a chance to choose another special topic after the last date to enroll is over ?? Please help me clarify this doubt ..",
