Like, do they ask for stuff which you would need to memorise as opposed to understanding? I'm scared coz I don't really like memorising stuff compared to understanding it.\n    â””â”€â”€ Yes there are many subjects in cse that require large amounts of memorization. Idk abt ai/ml\n        â””â”€â”€ Really? So not based on understanding but memorization! That is crazy! Is it just PESU that has this issue or every college has it?\n            â”œâ”€â”€ U can understand things too but certain have so much theory that I u have no choice but to memorize. Every college has this issue\n            â”œâ”€â”€ But dw it's pretty manageable if u study beforehand. Don't wait for the day before exams\n            â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Alright, got it. Thank you for replying.\n            â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Average topper ðŸ«¡\n            â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Lol, just speaking from the pov of toppers. U were telling me abt easy electives a few days agoðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­\n            â”‚           â””â”€â”€ yeah lol got that. just kidding ðŸ˜‚\n            â””â”€â”€ CS is not just programming, there is a *lot* more to CS. Coding is just a means to apply these concepts. So yes, you'll find that some courses will be math heavy, some will be entirely theoretical, some are applied, etc."
