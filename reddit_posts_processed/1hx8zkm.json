  "content": "\n\n4th floor, EC campus, btw.\n\nWe went early to order food and stood there for 20 minutes despite there being a very small crowd. Finally, the guy showed up with two plates, yelled our token number, said one was paneer and the other gobi, and gave me the paneer. By now, it was already quite crowded, so I just took the plate quickly and exited the crowd.\n\nOne of my friends took a bite of the \"paneer\" and spit it out a few seconds later. She told us it felt like chicken. We are vegetarians, so obviously, we were startled and also confusedm One of our other friends who eats meat tried it and confirmed it indeed was. We went back to the guy and informed him. He was quite rude about it until my friend and I fought with him and showed him the payment on my phone. Only THEN did he apologize and give us the paneer, and then brushed it off as if nothing happened.\n\nI understand there's always a huge crowd, so there must have been some sort of miscommunication. But please be careful while ordering in this canteen (or just any other canteen considering the shitty hygiene).\n\n\n",

But I didn't expect them to actually serve us chicken.\n\n.\n    â””â”€â”€ That's why I would suggest getting home cooked food, if you're a day scholar."
