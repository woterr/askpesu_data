      "body": "the 'worth it' part really depends on your mentor and how well they guide you (which is not very commor T-T)  \nsome people end up publishing a paper from it , might help you with your masters, but coming to placements, if you're going to put it on your resume , there obviously will be questions about it , so depends on how well you can explain your work.\n├── I'm in a similar situation. I can take up ISFCR or do anything industry internship through referral. Which one is better for a 4th sem guy?\n│   └── If masters, research projects better, if placements industry internships better.. Simple\n└── is it good to do this internship or not?\n    ├── u/a_soggy_french_fry ‘s is exactly what I would have replied.. it is totally dependent on your guide/mentor\n    └── See the internship won’t be anything amazing , best case it won’t be bad and you do actually end up learning at least something new.\n\n\nPersonality I’d suggest to take it and prioritise accordingly. start placement prep and keep a clear response ready for what you did during that time. Having some experience is better than nothing.\n\n\n\nKey point being PRIORITISE🙏"
