  "content": "I saw posts where rr ppl bave more half days. rr campus receives more funds for their fests and getting celebrity guests. some cie thing is online for them offline for us. The infra is better at rr as well. In general people also respect it more. How to deal with this, i guess I will have to ace cgpa to shift campus ( i was in a toxic school before so I want to have a decent college life now)",

      "body": "- half days thing is because of the department heads. Not decided by RR guys, but the respective campus's department heads (afaik this hasn't changed). \n\n- funds for fest and that is stuff is discrimination to be very honest. It is improving from what I can remember so don't worry about that too much. And either way both campuses and go to events in any campus. \n\n- CIE is online for RR campus because the CIE center is in EC campus. Why not use the things that are present in the campus, no? \n\n- Infra is better at RR because it older and it's been private for longer. EC campus's infrastructure is improving and has improved a **lot** since 2020. \n\n- People respecting it more is just stupid and up to you to care about. It's so meaningless in the grand scheme of things I'm just gonna ignore it. \n\nThe only discrimination you'll face is when you go and look for it. Otherwise if u just mind your business and enjoy the huge number of events occurring in both campuses you'll be happy and have other things to deal with.\n└── okay thanks senior. very well put answer."
