  "content": "Iâ€™m a new student and today I went to the GJBC Block library. The watchman asked me to leave at 9 PM, but I wanted to study a bit longer.\n\nSince Iâ€™m still getting to know the campus, I heard there are multiple libraries here. Does anyone know if thereâ€™s a library that allows students to stay till 12 AM or 1 AM? Also, is the 9 PM rule applicable to all libraries, or just GJBC Block library?",
