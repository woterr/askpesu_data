      "body": "Why would completing online courses be counted as an internship lol. An internship is a recognised form of employment.\n└── I read somewhere that doing courses on Mooc and all will provide you with some credits.\nAnd if by any chance person doesnt land an internship how can he/she cover up the credits?\n    └── In the final year, if you do not land an internship, then you can make up the credit deficit by taking up extra courses. PES often lists down 2-3 MOOC courses you can enroll for to claim credits from these courses. \n\nThey aren't internship credits and aren't recognised as an internship. They count under special topic course credits.\n        └── Apparently now its mandatory to do internship in 8th sem. new rules. U cant do special topics instead of internship\n            └── New way of guaranteeing placement ~~making sure you repeat a year and pay more fees~~"
