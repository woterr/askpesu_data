I plan on learning the next language which'll help me with dsa and oop for the next year but cannot choose between c++ and java.\n\nC++ sounds good as I already know C but Java is more popular. Is it better to learn both of them or just get really good at one during the course of the next semester for LeetCode practice and interviews?\n\n&#x200B;",
