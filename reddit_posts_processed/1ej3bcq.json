      "body": "Choose in this order: PES CS > BMS CS > MSRIT CS-spec. RV ECE should not be an option given the following:\n\n1. CS placements will always be better than ECE placements. \n\n2. Do not choose ECE if you aren't interested in it.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Ok thank you so much ðŸ™Œ\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ We have the same choices ðŸ’€... \n\nI was confused bw, pes cs and rv ece. \nWhat did u decide?\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ I saw a post regarding EC in RV and found that it's difficult and yeah I am not interested in it anyways, moreover I hate physics soo.. Donno most probably PES CS as of now...\nâ”‚           â””â”€â”€ Okay lol, even I'm inclined over pes cs only\nâ””â”€â”€ Hey why do you prefer PES cs over BMS cs?\n    â””â”€â”€ Assuming both are through CET, PES has slightly better placements, a much better crowd and a stronger academic focus. If you're focused on building the foundation of your career and not a party person, then PES is the right choice here. Ofc it comes with an average college life, but as I said, if you only care about the RoI and career opportunities, then PES is the way to go."
