If you want to meet and introduce yourself to others, there are WhatsApp groups and Discord servers set up for that (and even there, ensure you maintain your privacy). u/ChromaticChaos, please take down this post. \n\nTo anyone reading this comment - **do not share your personal details with anyone on the internet**, this includes your real name, address, and pictures. There are weird people on the internet, remember to keep yourself safe.\n└── Yeah, agreed"
