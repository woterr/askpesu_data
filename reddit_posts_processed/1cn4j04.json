  "content": "Pessat team has sent an email, declaring the counselling dates to be May 25 and 26. And it's not even online, it has to be at the Bangalore campus. \n\nDoes anyone know if there is a seat blocking system? By paying 10k and blocking seat like other colleges do, or do we have to pay full first year fees to secure the seat immediately?\n\nSome colleges will not have declared result by then, so it's a mess if we have to pay full year fees and give up all other possible colleges. If anyone could help it'd be great. ",

There should be. Are you sure you read it and understood it properly?\nâ””â”€â”€ Yeah, it clearly said no online. It's a lot of travelling for most of us.\n    â””â”€â”€ Wow that's so sad\n\nBut an upside might be higher cutoff ranks"
