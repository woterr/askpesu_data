  "content": "Hello PES folks, we've been working on Sling -- a social + anonymous social media exclusive to colleges.\n\nAs the description suggests, there are two modes, 'Anon' and 'Public'.\n\nYou can choose your vibe: share your thoughts anonymously in 'Anon' mode or engage openly in 'Public' mode, and keep up with the latest happenings in your college.\n\nFolks are verified through their university email, making sure there are no imposters and keeping things genuine.\n\nHere is the link: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.slinglabs.sling](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.slinglabs.sling)\n\nWe're just starting out, and would love any feedback or suggestions if you had any!",

Glad you find it interesting.  \n\n\nThere are not a ton of users right now, but we're working on getting there : )"

The usage is pretty limited with gmail, the university email grants unrestricted access. \n\nSorry to hear that! : ( Hope you get one soon, and join us!\n    â””â”€â”€ Ah I think you misunderstood. I'm a graduate. University email addresses weren't given out to all students until the pandemic started. So if you joined PES anytime before 2020, chances are you do not have one and have graduated without one.\n        â””â”€â”€ Oo that makes a lot of sense. Bummer!  \n\n\nBut thanks for the heads up! : )"
