It depends on amount of seats left in CSE\n    â””â”€â”€ Don't count on it. There's usually very few seats in CS and you'll be competing with a lot of people from ECE, Mechanical and EEE and all of them with 9.5+ cgpa"

The fees is way too much and the course is horrible.  Anybody in ECE EC campus will agree with me. I've written a lot more about the Pros and Cons of ECE in EC campus [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/1cyvucb/comment/l6ahwle/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).
