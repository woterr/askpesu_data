As far as I think so, you're safe\n└── They have told that 4 coding tests and 6 mcq tests are compulsory for placements for us lmaoo\n    ├── Shylaja told our batch about them being mandatory as well. Since she hasn't bothered me since I've graduated and started working I'm going to assume it's safe lmao\n    └── Or to be on the safe side, just login to the test and then exit after like 10 mins. Will guarantee attendance for the tests. Or be a Chad and make a script to do this, put it on resume and flex to interviewers about it :vckek:"
