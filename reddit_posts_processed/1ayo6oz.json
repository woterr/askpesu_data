YouTube won't really help because the course is weird as fuck\n├── Completely agree.Faisal's slides will help u do better.I won't  tell that u'll score good in the subject cause of them,but it will help u score more than reading usual slides.Sub is shit,can't help.\n\nFor info: They're on Pesu media discord.\n│   └── And what about numericals?Any place where I can learn them or find the solved answers??\n│       └── The numericals in Faisal sir's slides are mostly sufficient\n│           └── Oh,Thanks!\n├── Thanks!\n└── AV summaries are a gem for Phy. Invest that time, it's totally worth it."
