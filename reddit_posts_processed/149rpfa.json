Anything above 70% is good enough.\nâ””â”€â”€ that works perfectly, thankuu\n    â””â”€â”€ I never crossed 70% attendance in 6 sems and I haven't had a single problem because of low attendance. Your mentor will just say they won't let u write exams to encourage you to attend more. Just bunk all you want and habe fun :)\n        â””â”€â”€ Lmao thatâ€™s a stat and a halfðŸ˜‚â€¦but thank you very much for the tip:)"
