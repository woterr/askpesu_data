How are the scholarship cutoffs for your batch btw?\nâ”œâ”€â”€ For ec campus 8.5 for mrd phy cycle. 8.6 for chem cycle\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ 8.64 to be precise chem cycle and phy cycle 8.5\nâ””â”€â”€ What i was originally asking was will there be a FINAL list of students with their respective quotas and all? Because I'm not seeing anybody taking down any details here. The quota part is what I'm really worried about."

Can anyone who knows for sure please tell\nâ””â”€â”€ For pessat it must be 41k.\n\nIt's 20% of the sem fees. So sem fees is 2.05L and 20% of that is 41k.\n    â”œâ”€â”€ The website says itâ€™s 40%. Does that mean 40% of a semâ€™s fees per year?\n    â””â”€â”€ It's 40% of your sem fees , so it's gonna be 82k for pessat students and around 15k for cet peeps\n        â”œâ”€â”€ Cool cool. I can finally upgrade my eighth hand iPhone 6. \n\nYouâ€™re sure right? Cause Iâ€™m gonna be damn pissed otherwise\n        â””â”€â”€ Mann this sh\\*t is so confusing. I remember that it was written 20% of the sem fees. They've changed the description of scholarships again on their website\n            â””â”€â”€ Idk about your batch but for our batch (2020-24) it is 40% of sem fees .\n                â””â”€â”€ Oo then it might very well be the same for us. I just hope it doesn't go below 41kðŸ’€"
