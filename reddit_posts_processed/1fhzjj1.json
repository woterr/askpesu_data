Also, since it's a 2-credit course, is it similar to EVS or Constitution in the first year, like only having classes on Saturdays?\n        └── For us CIE L1 was mostly offline with some online ones especially near ISAs and it was after lunch break on tuesdays. Yeah mostly similar to EVS but they will ask you to attend a 10mcq test based on what was taught that day for attendance\n            └── ohkay..and no classes on saturday in 3rd sem then?\n                └── Yeah\n                    └── Also, do you know any of these profs?
