Wtf?\nâ””â”€â”€ â€¢Taking boards lightly (one shot before exam night will be sufficient ðŸ¤“ðŸ‘† ill focus on april attempt)\n\nâ€¢Physics was messed up for cbse folks past two years (pu only physics mcqs were messed up)\n\nâ€¢coaching centres the big ones dont care about boards and only focus on jee Often not even covering derivations and tellin to mug up formulae\n    â””â”€â”€ Exactly what you said bro \nMy coaching centre didnâ€™t focus on my boards and jammed the week between my boards and jee attempt with practicalâ€™s so i had no time to study for boards and regret it big time\n        â””â”€â”€ But there's a massive difference between 60% and 95%. Someone who scores a 60% lacks the most basic fundamentals. If you can cross 95% you definitely have atleast those clear. IMO you're simply underestimating yourself.\n            â””â”€â”€ For 95%tile u barely need 100/300 (depends on difficulty too). And that's quite easy."
