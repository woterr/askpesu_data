Also if I'm not wrong they take 8k students a year, which makes the competition much worse.\n\nNot defending PES btw, I despise this college with every fibre of my being but I do not believe VIT is much better.\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Why do you despise pes sm ðŸ’€\nâ”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ I feel like you should take VIT, especially if you have a lower category.\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ lol i may have exaggerated a little, this subreddit often leans towards pessimism.\n\nBut yeah I do dislike the management, the faculty is pretty average and the (PESSAT) fee is imo exorbitantly high considering everything. But if you want to go here then great, I'm not saying anything.\nâ””â”€â”€ Vit is in news for all the great reasons uh ðŸ˜‚\n    â””â”€â”€ Vit nirf ranking be ðŸ¤¡. Viteee exam in itself is a fucking joke"
