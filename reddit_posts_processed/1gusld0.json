  "content": "If I ask for refund for next sem, will it be possible?\nCan someone please help, I am messed up in hostel, I have 3 roommates, 2 other girls are also in my room the whole time. I can’t study a word there, the room is so messy, after a tiring day, if i wanna come lay down on my bed, can’t even do that cos someone or the other is sitting there. They are so loud even during ISAs , Keep on talking, I can’t go to study hall too as majority of the girls just come up there to gather around and laugh at silly jokes.. I had so much expectations from myself, I couldn’t even study..\n",
