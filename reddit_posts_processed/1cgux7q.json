You cant pay in installments, but you can split 460000 into 4 parts and pay separately using any payment method using pesu academy. But all payments have to be made online only\n\nAnd I feel its not worth it to join PES for ECE anymore\nâ””â”€â”€ How did uk i am from ece??ðŸ™ƒ\n    â””â”€â”€ The Fees ðŸ¤‘\n        â””â”€â”€ ðŸ˜­"
