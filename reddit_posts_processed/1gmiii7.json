  "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nApplied Materials recently visited our college with a CTC of 17.35 LPA, but they haven't provided a detailed breakdown yet. I heard they visited PES University this year as well. If anyone has any information on the breakdown of the offer (base salary, bonuses, stock options, etc.), Iâ€™d really appreciate your help.\n\nThanks in advance!  \nCheers!",
