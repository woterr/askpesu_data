I mean, I see no reason to do so\n    │   └── I didn't mean that sorry if I conveyed it wrong..all I'm saying is people know know how to use ai tools along with coding are given more preference in some companies\n    ├── >companies are ditching developers who know only to code without ai\n\nI'm set in this aspect, I only ask gpt to do all of my coding.\n    │   └── Lmaoo\n    │       └── 😭😂🙏\n    └── Lmao what, so much misinformation. \n\nFirstly AIML branch ≠ coding *with* AI. \n\nSecondly, most companies have specific guidelines on how AI must be used in the workplace with most not permitting it because of privacy concerns. The moment you start pasting propriety information or code online, you're in trouble. And even in the rare occurrence that you are permitted to do so, you should know that AI is quite trash at most use cases since it would require finer understanding of how your entire project works to actually help you achieve something.\n        ├── Woah but as far as I know companies want us to be an expert in ai tools as well along with coding so that their job becomes easier...even mark zuckerberg in his recent interview told that Meta is building AI that cab write code like a mid level engineer so that's when I thought soon coders will be replaced by ai..\n        │   └── You watched too many blackbox ai reels bud\n        │       └── Duh I'm not on insta😭\n        └── AI can just about help with basic code (still goes wrong sometimes) and I've seen my parents do some projects and it's safe to say ai will help jackshit for those. There is a reason why it's ai copilot and not ai pilot"

Last year this cutoff for aiml was 8.5ish\n    │   └── Stfu nigga. Why you asking same questions again and again\n    └── last semester's cutoff: RR cse- 9.36  \nRR aiml- 8.66   \nEC cse- 8.05   \nif your friend meets the cutoff (8.66 in this year) they can change to aiml"

What would you estimate it to be this year?\n    └── it's gonna be hard to say. I would attribute this jump to the increase in batch size, and since your batch size is even larger, the cutoff should then perhaps go higher. But then again, it's very hard to say."
