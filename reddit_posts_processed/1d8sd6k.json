Can you point out some of these reasons that make it \"horrendous\"? \n\nAnd yes, you do have drinking water, we used to take 15 minute vacations from classes to go to the library and fill our bottles.\n        │       ├── Hey buddy, you gotta explore EC campus properly first! Trust me, I'm not a huge fan of the campus but I hate RR equally! Both of them have their own pros and cons and whatever they've mentioned in this particular video is just shit!\n        │       └── Don't crap on ecc just yet. RR is a concrete jungle.
