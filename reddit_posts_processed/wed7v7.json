Similarly CNR is 50% of (x+2) semester fee.\n├── Is the scholarship only for one semester?\n│   └── No it's semester wise for all the semesters\n│       └── If someone gets into top20% for a single time , he'll get scholarship for all the remaining semesters?\n│           └── No every sem you have to come in top 20 of the class to get scholarship for that sem\n├── what is DAC scholarship ? how much do they give under that ?\n└── 2% of your section/stream or whole batch comprising all department students?\n    └── 1st year your cycle (phy/chem)  \n2nd year onwards your department.\n        └── Thank you!"
