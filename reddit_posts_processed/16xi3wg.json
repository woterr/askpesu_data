ITS ACHIEVABLE \n\nPractice typing, will help during ISA\nâ”œâ”€â”€ thank you so much, the ISAs are for 40 marks right?\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ yep\nâ”œâ”€â”€ But teachers said that ISA will be in hybrid mode. Is typing really that important ?\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Upto you.. coz typing python codes is more easier than writing it down\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Could you pls link or tell me where to find bms notes for maths\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Its there on discord.. just check once.. and let me know.. i will get it uploaded if its not there\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ There's a discord server for PES?\nâ”œâ”€â”€ What are bms notes and where can we do d them?\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ BM Shankar.. he is the BEST mathematics prof in S&H Dept.\nâ””â”€â”€ Upvoted coz BM Shankar.
