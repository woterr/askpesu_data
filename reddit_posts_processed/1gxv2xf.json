      "body": "You can take it in any semester, just pay the dues in the backlog registrations tab. Its 250 for each credit and you're allowed to take a minimum of 24 credits each sem.\n├── Summer term backlogs are also a thing.\n└── moving from 3rd sem to 4th i have 9 credtis backlog in this sem and 15 from 2nd sem, will i get an year back or can i clear all these in the summer term?\n    └── The summer term is ideal...you get to study whole heartedly without insem subjects to deal with. Like I said you can apply for 24 credits minimum so 6 subjects you can apply to in summer. Perhaps have to sacrifice summer term internships if you were planning on applying. Your call."
