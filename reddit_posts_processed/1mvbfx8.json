Also, side note: I think those silver T-shirt wale with the Bajaj logo the training people are staying somewhere above GJBC (no clue which floor), boys and girls both.\n\nSo I start from the 8th floor and head down. Construction going on everywhere, one space looked like a design room thoda crazy setup that is fckin amazing.\nThen I hit the 6th floor and hear loud noise. First thought, “yaar construction hi hoga,” but then I realised this was a girl’s voice.\n\nCuriosity kicks in, I move towards the stairs and bhai… wild scene. One girl with a guy, proper hookup vibes basically threesome type going down.\nI froze for two seconds, then bolted. “Bhaiii sab” My brain was just buffering.",
