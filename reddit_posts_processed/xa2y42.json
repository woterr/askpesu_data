Read the key word I mentioned \"thoroughly\". You've to know everything there is in each and ever slide in the ppt.\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ What bout math ? I heard from seniors it's hard\nâ”‚           â””â”€â”€ Yup math is hard. Only for math you need ramana and grewal textbooks.\nâ”‚               â”œâ”€â”€ And ofc attention in class\nâ”‚               â””â”€â”€ ic , so how many hrs do u think an avg student needs to dedicate per day for a 9+ ?\nâ”‚                   â””â”€â”€ It really depends on the individual, their attention in class. So it's different for everyone.\nâ”‚                       â””â”€â”€ Well i aced my cbse boards but flunked all entrances, kcet  10k+ , will i be ok lmao ðŸ’€?\nâ”‚                           â””â”€â”€ Doesn't really matter. Know people with 30k, 60k in kcet get around 9GPA. The efforts you put in now matters a lot. If you're hardworking, dedicated nothing is impossible.\nâ”‚                               â””â”€â”€ Demm , thx senior , imma try my best :)\nâ””â”€â”€ Oh ok thanks..."
