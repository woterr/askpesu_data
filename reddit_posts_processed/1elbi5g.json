Hope they increase opportunities for students and actually take this in a good direction.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Huge thanx.\nâ””â”€â”€ Can you throw some light on the \"apple recruitment cell\", I am just not up to date to the info.\n    â””â”€â”€ Apple incubation centre to teach students abt Mac OS Dev and Mac OS apps and other things related to iOS / iPadOS / macOS. Leading to additional projects or internships and maybe jobs.\n        â”œâ”€â”€ Is it only exclusive for bmsce Or any other college also have?\n        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Afaik only bmsce has setup an official apple incubation centre. So prolly only BMS.\n        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ afaik its exclusive\n        â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Wait, what's this from msrit then?\n\nhttps://msrit.edu/research/apple.html\nThere's an apple lab in msrit as well\n        â”‚           â””â”€â”€ my b\n        â””â”€â”€ https://msrit.edu/research/apple.html\n\nLooks like the same is available in msrit as well\n            â””â”€â”€ Iâ€™m not too sure.
