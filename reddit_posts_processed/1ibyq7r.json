Hence more applicants and hence higher cut offs to short list the same number of people.\n    â””â”€â”€ I don't think a company really would bother to go to individual colleges and set different cgpa requirements. Unless it's some iit/nit ofcourse.\nIg in the eyes of recruiters bms, pes are the same more or less"

His CET rank is 13 times higher than mine i highly doubt I can even get a 9 gpa in my entire four years.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ 7th and 8th ez 9.5+\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Doesn't really matter. Most ppl get placed before 7th sem results\nâ””â”€â”€ Well then having a cgpa of say 8 here would give you the same opportunities as someone with a 9-9.5 there for placements, if there's so much inflation.\n    â””â”€â”€ so have having 7.5 cgpa gives u same opptunities as 8.5 to 9 in other clgs?"
