They will run through a quick orientation for the students followed by you dispersing into your specific bootstrap groups. Pretty sure there will be 4 or 5 like previous years, with each group being occupied with a separate activity.\nIf you haven't gotten a notification on the pesu app yet, check your email, cos that's the only other place they can message you. Hope y'all have a great bootstrap (bunk how much ever you want, that shit is not important 💀👍)"
