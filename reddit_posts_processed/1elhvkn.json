They usually waive it.\n└── We're interested in Machine learning\n    └── ML is broad. What kind of ML research do you want to pursue? Foundational ML or applied ML? Do you want to work in computer vision, NLP or reinforcement learning? Which field do you want to apply these techniques in? Etc. You will need to first have a solid research goal before you can approach a prof since they are specialised in different fields."
