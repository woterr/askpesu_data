      "body": "PES RR campus is known widely only for the CS branch . All other branches are just like what your average college will offer to you\nâ””â”€â”€ Could you tell anything about CSE at Electronic city campus.\n    â””â”€â”€ Let's get one thing straight - both campuses are not equal. There are major tradeoffs, each campus has its pros and cons though. One important insider info is that the Electronic City campus will be converted into a fully medical college and the CSE department will be shifted to RR campus anyhow. The timeframe for this is however unkown, may happen within the next 2-4 years.\n\nEC campus has a much better physical campus. Lots of open space and from my personal experience, the people here are a lot kinder and helpful. There's a collaborative spirit vs the extremely competitive spirit at RR (pretty natural since the highest rankers are quite competitive and end up in RR)\n\nThe CSE course syllabus is the same for both campuses and we're graded on the same papers. However, the opportunities are much greater in RR, many companies still treat the EC campus as PESIT and not under PESU which may significantly harm your placement opportunities if you're considering it. Another important point to note - a lot of the CSE faculty at EC campus have left the college as this campus has no future (conversion to medical college). Hence, the existing teachers are forced to teach a variety of subjects that they don't have sufficient knowledge about.\n\nCSE at PESU (any campus) has the benefit of having its syllabus updated yearly. Hence it is much more relevant than any other engineering college's CSE programs. The tradeoff is that PESU gives you a lot of work to finish during the sem so you won't be able to focus on other things. Other colleges are liberal and you'll be free to pursue other interests and build your professional skills on your own.\n\nBITS offers you a lot of freedom and is better in every way I can possibly think of. I have close friends in BITS and hence know a lot of the details. We had some ex-BITS faculty teach us and they were absolutely brilliant. They left because PESU management is horrible and treats teachers pathetically."

Go to bits peacefully, why'd you want to come here and cry.\nâ””â”€â”€ The only reason I am inclined towards PES is that I don't have enough marks for CSE anywhere (GENRAL CATEGORY BOY)\n    â””â”€â”€ Only placements are good here nothin else chumma why you wanna get railed here. If you really only want cse then come to pes (as last option), if you are down to take any branch go off to bits peacefully"

      "body": "CS is king here. ECE plays second fiddle with other branches being lucky to even get instruments to play. I won't say that placements are the only thing that are good about the place - I was exposed to a lot of opportunities, but it was all mostly CS exclusive with ECE getting a bit of action.\n\nIf you're keen on doing a specific subject (read: CS or bust), then PES will do its job (disclaimer - I only speak for the ring road campus)\n\nIf you're flexible with branches/courses and you want to have a more chill life on campus, bits will serve you better. BITS is academically more rigorous as well.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Clear and to the point.\nâ””â”€â”€ I got rank 240 in PESSAT, that means I will surely get CSE RR campus, now can you tell me if it is my best option or should i consider others?\n    â””â”€â”€ Answer doesn't change much. If you're keen on doing CS then you'll have lots of opportunities here. If you're ok with doing something different, then BITS might be a better choice. \n\nPersonally, I picked branch over college just because I struggle to do things I don't enjoy. My option was Mech @ Hyderabad if my memory serves me right, but I was keen on CS, and now after graduation I'm super happy with my decision.\n\nOn the flip side, I know people who didn't have a good time here and would have much rather have gone to BITS. At the end of the day, it depends on your personal preference - what your interest is, how much does \"campus life\" matter to you, and what are you hoping to get out of college.\n\nWrt to the campus part, once you actually attempt to make friends and explore things, you'll find plenty of fun stuff to do and you'll make some great friends in the process.\n\nEdit: also yes, you're gonna get CS for sure at RR"
