  "content": "I’m currently in my 6th semester, and honestly, my luck with internships hasn’t been great. Most of my friends have already landed internships at big companies, idk how are they are getting it \n\nI’m a bit worried — if I don’t secure an internship by the end of this semester, will it affect my placements? Do companies give an upper hand to candidates who already have internship experience? Or is it still possible to stand out without one?\n\n",
