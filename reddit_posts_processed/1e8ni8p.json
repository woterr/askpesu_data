The demographic of PES is comprised mostly of kids raised in good/well-recognised English-medium schools in Bangalore (an effect of the inflated fees lol), so almost everyone prefers English over their native languages. There is no discrimination or ill-treatment of north Indians (and I say this as the conventional \"outsider\" to this city, but was born and raised here).\n\nHowever, since you are moving to a different state, it is good to pick up basic phrases that will help make life a little easier. As long as you don't keep sticking to \"Kannada gothilla\" for everything and show a little effort in learning basic sentences, numbers etc, you won't be ill-treated.\n├── Why bro\nOp\nSay on their face kannada gothilllaaa and on top of that say\nHindi is the offcial  langauage of the country saar\nYpu learn hindi\n😝😝😝😝😝\n│   ├── I think you meant to type \"national\" language lol. Hindi is a recognised official language.\n\nAnd yeah OP do not do this (unless you want to get beaten up by auto goons).\n│   │   └── Do this op\nPes median icse s 12lpa\nWith e lafda  you can get that  per month + bigg boss offer\n😝😝😝🤑🤑\n│   └── Seems like you need to go back to school\n└── That helps a lot.
