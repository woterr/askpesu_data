Other top companies like Apple, Visa, Oracle etc. went with 8+ or 8.5+ but it might be different for future batches.\n├──  thanks man\n├── so the % of companies asking for 9+ is  pretty less ?\n│   └── Yea I'd say a maximum of 10 companies asked for a cgpa of 9+\n│       └── appreciate it\n└── People keep saying that even though the cuttoff is this much but you do get filtered out when complared to ppl with gpa 9ish,how true is this?"
