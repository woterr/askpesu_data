I got this info from my family friend who works at the counselling department of kcet and comedk\n    └── The faculty in PES ain't better , in end everyone is gonna do self study BMS has a more relaxed schedule which will help you on focusing on your LC and extra projects .Regarding placements most of the companies visiting PES are also visiting BMS. Plus the strength in BMS is very lesser than PES, PES is becoming the VIT of blr."
