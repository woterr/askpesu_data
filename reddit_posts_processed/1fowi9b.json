Pain has a way of distorting reality, making it seem like there is no other way out. But believe this: there is hope, even when itâ€™s hard to see.\n\nIn this vast world, there are moments of beauty, love, and peace that are waiting for youâ€”moments you have yet to experience, people you have yet to meet, and love you have yet to feel. The thoughts youâ€™re battling now are temporary; they do not own your future.\n\nYou are not alone. There is always someone ready to listen, to care, to walk beside youâ€”even when you feel unseen. Reach out. Speak to someone. You do not have to carry this burden in silence. Your life matters more than you can imagine, and the world would be less bright without you in it.\nPlease give tomorrow a chance!\nâ””â”€â”€ No some are alone. It's always like such things they get noticed if you speak you'll be considered an attention seaker."
