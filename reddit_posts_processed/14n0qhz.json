      "body": "How do the IS syllabus and placements compare with CS at PES? If there aren't too many differences, you should pick IS. \n\nOpportunities, clubs, research, facilities, and faculty at RV are far better than what is at PES today. PES only has an updated syllabus which does not make a great difference since it is barely enough to make a dent. Placements if I remember are equally good at both colleges.\n├── whats your take on BMS CSE vs PES CSE?\n└── Thanks.   I have already paid 4.5L for PESSAT CSE seat and July 17 is last date of surrender. I have ComedK rank 1024 and have a slim chance of RVCS ISE. Is it still worthwhile to forgo 4.5L for a RVCE ISE seat?  Net gain will be 3.5L (4.5\\*4 - 2.5\\*4 + 4.5)\n    └── What are your chances of RV ISE? Depends on that dude. Looks like you will need to gamble a bit. Ensure you have a good backup first.\n        └── Pls reply PES EC CS(pessat) or MSRIT aiml(thru comedk)"
