      "body": ">both are almost equal\n\nBecause they... *are*? Unlike the other colleges you mentioned, both campuses at PES are indeed equivalent, if not the same, with pooled placements and other opportunities. Sure, there used to be differences way back, but since ECC gained autonomy in 2018, they are now objectively the same.\n\nChoosing RR over EC campus in 2025 just because it (was) called \"main\" campus does not make sense. Choose the closer one if you get the same branch at both campuses.\n└── Is the cse median really 13-14lpa?or is it inflated by them by including off campus placements too?\n    └── It is. It cannot be inflated using off campus placements because quite simply they do not have the data for it - there is no way to track off campus placements automatically.\n        ├── Got it\nThanks\n        └── Hi i will be joining pes this year for CSE will it be a good choice, are  placements and internship opportunities really that good as shared by other people and based on ur exp will it be better or worse in future?? Plz help"
