Now with all the talks of placements, internships and all im more stressed than ever. All my friends have boyfriends they roam with meanwhile the one guy I liked doesnâ€™t even bother with me. My friends donâ€™t hang out with me if I make plans. I donâ€™t have any talents, no exceptional qualities. Just winging everything.\n\nÂ that's it",

Your friends might find new partners or stay togetherâ€”it's hard to say. \nLife will change, and new things will come your way. I recommend trying to learn something new. It could be a great project in your field or something completely different, like sketching or reading a book. \nEventually, you'll find friends who are just like you. You may not understand this now, but trust me, this is a form of freedom. My friend and I used to explore a new restaurant every weekend or drive to random places without a destination."

Whatever is happening to you is just a phase and this too shall pass. Iâ€™ve observed atleast 80% of the couples pretending to be happy but are rotting internally (with insecurities) so consider yourself lucky. If loneliness scares you, then seeking companion ship often backfires and you might end up in something you never really wanted (the grass is always greener on the other side) Just focus on what makes you happy and things will automatically fall into place. \n\nYou seem to be self aware to call yourself average, then Iâ€™m assuming you have the maturity to get your shit together and work towards what you want in life. If you donâ€™t know what you want, atleast work in the direction that makes you happy. It maybe a technical or nontechnical. Seeking social validation is an invisible poison that will eventually kill you emotionally. \n\nGood luck ! Hope you achieve your ambitions"
