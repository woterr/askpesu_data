So let me tell you something somehow works out in the end. For now just enjoy studying for 40 more days and take what you get."

If you can afford fees through pessat, it's not very high compared to the university fee in countries like Canada, Singapore or USA. Indian universities except for iits, nits and iiits aren't really worth it."
