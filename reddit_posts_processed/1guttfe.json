Project, based on what topics learnt was for 7 marks. The project topics were allotted by the teacher. Project was in team of 3. the other 5 marks were assignment, just after the completion of every unit and before the ISA. Usually for most of the teachers made it an numerical solving class- with help from them.\n\n(Discord -> PES Media)"
