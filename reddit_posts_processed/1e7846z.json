  "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m hoping someone here can help me out. We’re trying to redeem a student offer for a laptop, but the process requires a student email or a specific username and password. The problem is, we called the college, and they said they don’t provide any sort of username specific to the college for this purpose. Additionally, the college mentioned that student emails won’t be created until a month or two into the semester, but we need to purchase the laptop soon.\n\nHas anyone else faced this issue? How did you manage to verify your student status without an official school email? Any advice or alternative methods for verification would be greatly appreciated!\n\n\n\nThanks in advance!",
