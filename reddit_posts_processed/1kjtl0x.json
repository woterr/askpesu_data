Check the FAQs for more info.\n└── bro can you tell me, on an average how many seats will be vacant every year and how much cgpa is required to change my branch from eee to ece or aiml.\n    ├── >!Check the FAQs for more info!<\n    └── As I said. Usually there are a handful of seats and you need a very high CGPA.\n        └── bro is 9.5 enough\n            └── Yes, but can *you* guarantee that you'll get 9.5? Even before joining and seeing how rigorous the exams are?\n                └── brother can you pls help me with,what are all prerequisites that i should know before joining college, so that i can secure a good cgpa for branch change.\n                    ├── Search this subreddit.
