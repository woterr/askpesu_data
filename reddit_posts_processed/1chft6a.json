Please search this subreddit before posting duplicate questions.\n├── oh I'm sorry, I will check it out\n├── So i assume cant get any CS related or circuital branch with 96ile (60k crl) ? Gave Pessat tho, attempted 120q with almost no guesses\n│   ├── nice brother, btw when was ur shift\n│   │   └── 28th Evening\n│   └── CS, nope. Not sure about ECE and EEE though but mostly not either\n├── what can someone expect atthat percentile\n└── Why would anyone with 98 percentile go to pes\n    └── Because of the pride /s\n\nTo answer your question, there's no reason for anyone to choose PES at that percentile. It does not make sense logically and financially."
