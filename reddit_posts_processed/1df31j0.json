There is a fixed formula used to calculate your GPAs. However, sometimes, when a batch performs poorly in a course they will shift the marks-to-grade mappings (so maybe instead of 90+ being an S they shift it to 85+). This isn't the accurate definition of relative, and additionally we do not know how they determine the magnitude of the shift so it's not a transparent process.\n\nIt is independently applied to any course when a batch performs poorly. So you might have a semester where this was applied to 3/5 courses.\nâ””â”€â”€ My friends mentor told him that there was relative grading for all subjects, idk if she just told that to boost his confidence or something\n    â””â”€â”€ Nah. It's absolute by default. Relative is independently applied to each course based on need."
