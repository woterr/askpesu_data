      "body": "The cutoff to appear for placements is 6.75. So, you wouldn't be eligible to appear in the first place. If you still have a few more semesters to complete before placements start, try to improve your CGPA. You could also try applying off campus.\n└── Do gpa matters in off campus?\n    └── It depends on the company. Some mass recruiters like TCS, etc will offer you a job, but with very less salary. Other companies might consider your GPA. If you have really good projects and a lot of work experience (internships), it could make a difference. If you don't land a job, you could try doing masters, which you could basically consider as your second chance. Do well there and maybe you'll get a good job."
