Even semesters it starts from 8:45pm \n\n  \nHonestly you can chill everything will be taught from scratch but if you really wanna do something , learn C or Python to a decent level through a course like CS50X or Programming With Mosh or sum\nâ”œâ”€â”€ do they provide some material ( some source ) from which they teach and that comes from exam, or do we have to study class notes for exam?\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ they provide all notes and their corresponding videos on pesuacademy, for even more stuff you can look into betterpes or join discord for much more stuff\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ when you say \" notes \" do you mean class slides, or they have notes separately on those topics?\nâ”‚           â””â”€â”€ some topics do have notes as well - but its mostly slides on pesuacademy, but you can get all notes for every unit from the discord server, for almost every subject\nâ””â”€â”€ 845 pm?...
