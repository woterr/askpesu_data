I am concerned that it would be very hectic since we would be working in a fast-paced environment with startups, and it is six days of working ??  \nI would be very grateful to anyone who could provide me with this information.   \nThanks a lot for your time!

      "body": "The work culture is too good at PVL. The main objective in a startup is to have the MVP asap. So, the working schedule is a bit hectic but at the same time the goals to be completed in a given timeline will be small. So, if you are good at the concepts or the work you do, u can finish it very easily. \n\nThis is what I fell personally. There will be different types of activites also being done in PVL which is chill us a little and work with them. People like ANIL sir, Suresh Sir are too good. To get the work done you have to roam around kiriti like anything. He will tell that he will get it done, but he will forget that issue as soon as you leave. this is because he is handling too many startups, but he is a very good person from heart."
