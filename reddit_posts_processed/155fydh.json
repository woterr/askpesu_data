  "content": "Can someone please give an estimate date around when classes would start for the upcoming batch (2023-2027) at PES University? It was informed to us earlier that classes will start from August 7 or August 14 during the 1st round of PESSAT counselling but KCET counselling hasn't started yet and it should go on till atleast mid to late September, so for KCET students classes can only be started around end of September or starting of October, will that mean classes for PESSAT students will start early or will our classes also start along with KCET students? Also, for Comedk colleges, counselling should go on tiil atleast mid to late August which means their classes will probably start only from 1st week of September. Someone please help. ",
