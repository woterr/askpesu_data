      "body": "Since I maintain a history of all my resumes/CVs, I can answer this pretty accurately. Just went through them and here is the summary:\n\n1. When my 6th semester was going on (so while applying for summer internships), I had a 2-month research experience at CCBD. I had 1 paper, three ongoing research projects (one from capstone, one from NLP course, one side project) and a few other miscellaneous projects. You can check my LinkedIn (DM for link) for the paper by checking the one published before 2021. My primary projects included an NLP library in C which supported basic functions and neural embedding models, a working version control system, a self-supervised video querying engine and a knowledge graph based essay evaluator. It was mainly my research experience and ML/NLP-related stuff that got me my 7th semester internship, so not naming the other random projects. Extra stuff included scholarships, club/fest work and other achievements. \n\n2. During placement season in Aug 2021, everything from the previous point + my ongoing research experience during the 7th semester + ongoing TA experience + another scholarship.\n\nI don't want to disclose more without compromising my identity, so if anyone wants to see what my CV looks like today and 4 years ago, DM."
