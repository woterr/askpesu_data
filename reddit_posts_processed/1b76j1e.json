PES absolutely not worth 4.8lpa.\n│       └── The fees are extremely superfluous. 6 years ago, the fees for me was 3.2 and even then we considered it to be high. 4.8LPA is too high for a tier 2/3 University in Bangalore. Placements aren't the only thing that determine a college's quality and this is primarily their only strength, but even that isn't worth 4.8. I'd definitely recommend this place if you get in through CET, but PESSAT fees is too high. Look for other similarly ranked options instead.\n│           └── Ye absolutely. OP u/Bad-Reputation-777  try to get a good KCET rank. +1 PES is worth the KCET fees. PESSAT can be a reasonable backup plan imo.\n│               ├── I'm not from Karnataka so I am going for Comedk.\n│               │   ├── All the best!\n│               │   └── Bro what resources are you using to prepare for  comedk ?\n│               └── everybody gangsta till they see rvce management cse fees 💀💀💀\n│                   └── Isn't it like 16 lpa 💀.\n│                       ├── 64 lakhs + GST 🚩🚩☠️☠️\n│                       └── Plus gst\n│                           └── 🫡 good luck y'all 😭\n└── why? placement issue? crowd issue?\n    └── https://bit.ly/pesu-faq\n\nCheck the pros and cons."

      "body": "Firstly, don't aim at PESSAT, aim higher. Secondly, it's usually at KCET level or a bit higher. If you are already preparing for JEE/BITSAT then there's no need for extra prep for this. It's usually a cakewalk for most people aiming higher. There are multiple posts every year on this topic, search this subreddit and you'll find more relevant posts with answers about the pattern and other details."
