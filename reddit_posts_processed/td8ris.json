If you fail a course, you will have a backlog for that course, which you will need to clear before you graduate\n└── What is the score required to not have a backlog?\n    └── You only get grades. F grade is a fail, so anything but that\n        └── And how much does one need to get in order to get an F grade\n            └── I think 35 is a pass. But you need to pass when you combine the ISA + ESA + assignment and/or project components\n                └── 40% in each subject will guarantee that u will pass that subject"
