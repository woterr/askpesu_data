      "body": "You don't need to take Kannada. Knowing english is sufficient.\n\nBut I think you should and learn basic kannada. Like words and phrases that will help you get around the city. I'm also not a kannadiga (though i am a resident) but knowing to speak kannada has been helpful.\nâ””â”€â”€ I think most of the ppl mistook me. I meant is there a compulsory subject of language that we need to take and write exams for like there is in BMSIT (kannada is mandatory subject to take over there)\n    â””â”€â”€ NO. PES is not VTU\n        â””â”€â”€ Thanks mate"
