I want ECE in RR campus but idk if it's better than VIT vellore ece\n└── bro its VIT bro its ranking in like NIRF and all is way too good obvio VIT ECE better you high or something?\n    └── you know nirf ranking is just a scam right? private colleges can pay them to rank their colleges higher\n        └── Source : Trust me bro\n            ├── Source: having common sense\nDo you really think vit, anna university are better than some iits nits and some campus' of bits pilani?\n            │   ├── See, that's the thing with India. Ppl think of IITs and NITs as the best clgs in the world. Ik vit shudnt be as top as it is rn, but nirf is based on everything like campus life, academic.\n            │   └── But as someone from Tamil Nadu, I'd say Anna is actually one of the top universities in India and it deserves it's place.\n            └── brother manipal has been ranked higher than dtu,nsut and many other colleges that are way more competetive, so do u really think that nirf ranks mean anything\n                └── Ik they are better but vit is not a bad option too, it is one among them\n                    └── I'm afraid it cant compete with colleges like those. A person needs to score 99 percentile to get cse in nits dtu etc, for vit on the other hand, pretty much anyone can get into it cause of the category structure as long as they're willing to pay extra."
