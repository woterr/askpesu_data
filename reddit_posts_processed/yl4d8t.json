      "body": "Basically CS-AI/ML means u r getting a computer science degree with AI/ML specialsiation. The syllabus for both are almost same. You will have 2 types of courses, core subjects and elective courses. Core subjects are going to be common irrespective of the specialisation. In 3rd year AI/ML will have electives only from ML and Data Science like Data Analytics, NLP and Deep Learning while CS students will have electives from core computing, cybersecurity and ML.\n\nSo you don't have to do any minor courses to make up for anything because minor courses have core subjects itself.\n└── Thank you very much"
