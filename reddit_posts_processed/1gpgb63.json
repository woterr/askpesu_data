So 1+1 = 2 lakh which is 50% of 4 lakhs\n    â””â”€â”€ It's not 25% of sem 1, it's 25% of whole year handed out in sem 1."

And do they consider only a single class or something else coz people around me gossip that for the top % thing they will consider both RR and EC campus I'm fkg confused\nâ”œâ”€â”€ same question\nâ””â”€â”€ idk about the optional fee but the scholarships are given for the top whatever percent of the entire batch in that campus. so you'd have to come in the top 5 or 20 percent of everybody thats in the same department as you, in the same campus. for first years it'll be snh, and from subsequent years it'll be whichever department you go to"
