      "body": "General trend is yes.. There r exceptions obviously\n└── More of the exception than the norm actually. For example for my batch and the batch before, the highest packages were from people who had 8.5-9 CGPA. Having a higher CGPA only gives you a small edge in placements. After that it's all about how great your profile is.\n    └── Wdym by a great profile???\n        └── Your skillset, projects, the overlap between your strengths and the company's requirements and past experiences.\n            └── I'm a social recluse so do you think I might have a hard time at PES and do cs(aiml) get placed with high packages??\n                └── Firstly, non placement advice: if you have diagnosed your problem and indeed see it as one, then you need to step out of that mindset. Being a recluse does not help anyone. Get out of your comfort zone, see what is out there, meet people and network.\n\nSecondly, as I mentioned it depends on your skills and what you can build for yourself. You are either going to enter PES or are in 2nd year - this means you have a ton of time to work on yourself. Remember that the only person who can hold you back is yourself.\n                    └── What do you mean by \"it depends on my skills\" like many people say that i don't get it,tbh I don't have any skills I'm just 17 years old and for the past 2 years only focused on getting into a good college.\nI don't have any prerequisite in coding so yeah.\n                        └── Well then its a good thing placements are 3 years away right xD\n\nYou have ample time to work on yourself - figure out your interests, learn what interests you, pickup skills and make them your strengths. Just studying the syllabus here will not make you eligible for placements: you **have** to put in extra effort, else you run the risk of not being placed.\n                            └── How much do you think a cs(aiml) major will get paid after getting placed ??"
