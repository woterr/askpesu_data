      "body": "I was in a similar situation 3 years back , decided to travel from home (26 kms one way) via two-wheeler (bike). I gave up during the first week itself , it is so tiring riding more than 2 hours in a day . In 2-3 weeks I had severe lower back pain , started suffering from hairloss due to wearing helmet for longer durations , had to skip meals to reach on time and was so tired after coming back home I had no time for studies and other extra-curricular stuffs . During this covid hit and we hardly had any offline classes during the first year . During the second year I joined hostel and I have to say I have to say I have had one of the best years there . The food is manageable (nothing great about it ) . The hostel administration is a pain in the ass but you got to live with it . The location (inside campus ) is a big advantage. Regarding the curfew it is 9pm but you are allowed till 10 pm .\nThe only problems I faced were of the wifi(almost everything non-educational is blocked on it) and availability of  safe drinking water.\nAgain the final decision is upto to you , many of my friends who live nearby did travel everyday and managed to keep up with their studies and other stuff.\n├── i see, thanks for the elaborate response! i would head to college by bus if i choose to commute, so i probably won't experience as much stress as you did while commuting. can you elaborate on the wifi? are social media websites and youtube blocked as well? did you find any workarounds? did using a vpn bypass any restrictions on the wifi?\n│   └── Social media sites are blocked , YouTube runs on a restricted version (non - educational stuffs are blocked) . They are vpns (they tend to block the vpns also)to bypass it . The best way would be to port to jio , they have this unlimited 5g internet offer , make use of it .\n└── Tbh hostel life is fun gotta experience it once in lifetime"
