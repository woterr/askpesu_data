PES on its own does not have a transfer credit program which allows you to cover a year here and then continue at another uni.\n└── Ohh okay. So if you find a university that accepts these credits, then will Pes likely ask you to pay the rest four years of fees before leaving? What’s your opinion?\n    └── Since PES does not have any transfer credit program on its own, it would be equivalent to dropping out. They wont charge you the remaining 4 years of fees.\n        └── Ok thanks"
