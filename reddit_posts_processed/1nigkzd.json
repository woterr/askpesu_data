  "content": "Iâ€™ve had a mediocre start with a GPA of 8.81 in my first two semesters. I want to improve in 3rd sem but unlike the first 2 sems I don't know what my strong subjects and weak subjects are just yet. I'm also very scared of the fact that I might screw up ISA-1 terribly and end up with less than 25-30 in all subjects and this is causing me to lose a lot of sleep everyday. I don't think I have written an ISA/ESA without being super stressed out and anxious causing me to be sick prior to the exams and this has made me come to loathe the week leading upto these tests and the tests themselves.\n\nIs there anything I can do reduce this anxiety and what can I do to ensure I can cross 9 ish gpa by the end of this year? Thanks a lot guys.",

Unless you want that CNR/MRD money ðŸ’´ðŸ’°\nâ”œâ”€â”€ i want to try for masters after few years of working , specifically an mba from a decent school so im scared  ðŸ˜­\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Trust me \nI know people with 8 GPAâ€™s who attended top MBA colleges across the world\nâ”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ thanks for the info!\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ If youâ€™re interested in doing an MBA in the US, your GPA is already perfectly fine for top programs. Maintain it but you main focus would be on placements and building up top tier work experience over 3-4 years as well as a great GMAT score.\n\nI am in the second year at a good MBA program here in the US and my CGPA was 8.73. Didnâ€™t affect me much.\nâ””â”€â”€ It does matter in the placements season though. A 9.1+ is required to maximise your opportunity in all the companies\n    â””â”€â”€ Placements are a mirage. There are a billion opportunities out there. Only thing that matter is how well you code bud. An 8.5 GPA is more than enough."

If the company has a gpa cutoff you are effectively competing with lesser people so it maximises your chance of getting placed\n            â””â”€â”€ i heard gpa cutoffs were pretty minimal tho, im talking 7 or 8 at max"
