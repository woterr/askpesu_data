And why can't you take both?\n└── We were told that, i don't have an idea about it....\n    └── That's incorrect. Check this subreddit to see what a special topic is and what an elective is. I've taken both R and DA as courses.\n        └── Students who have chosen R programming and shortlisted you will not be able to chose data analytics as your elective in the fifth semester so in the excel sheet I shared if you wana drop the course in case you are planning to take data analytics elective chose yes under column drop, for other students who filled form now or not shortlisted your preference will be taken later, please discuss about it with your senior friends, do not send me personal mail, messages or call me.\n\nThis was sent to the ec campus kids...."
