Assuming I'll be eligible for any one of the scholarships, if I don't have a union Bank account before the results come out will I be denied the scholarship amount? Also once the scholarship eligibility list comes out, will they contact us about our account details?",

You don't have to worry, opening an account takes like 5-10 mins if you directly visit the branch (provided it's not crowded).\n\nAfter the results get announced, they will send everyone a Google form to enter your bank acc number. Just type your SRN and acc no and send it. This will only happen once. From second sem onwards they will not send Google form again. So you can't change the branch.\n\nAlso many people (including myself) opened the account after results were announced so you still have time.\n├── Can we apply for scholarship in the later semesters? Or is it only in first sem?\n└── Thanks a lot"
