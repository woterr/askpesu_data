I guess they will start R2 and R3 together since KEA will complete R3 immediately after R2 with maybe a week gap between the 2 rounds\nâ”œâ”€â”€ will go for r3 ??\nâ””â”€â”€ did u join through r2 ??\n    â””â”€â”€ confused now whether to wait for R3 and try  RVCE upgradation\n        â”œâ”€â”€ What did u get in R2?\n        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ PES CS in R1 and R2\n        â””â”€â”€ Anyway we have missed the bootstrap induction program, shld we wait for R3 ?\n            â””â”€â”€ my guess is they will start classes together for R2 and R3 so if you feel that your rank has a chance of getting an upgraded college or course, makes sense to wait for R3\n\ncheck the cutoffs when KEA releases it today\n                â””â”€â”€ can i dm u ?\n                    â””â”€â”€ sure\n                        â””â”€â”€ Check dm"
