      "body": "Why bunking so much bro. best is to understand topics in class and making notes. Trust me studying yourself I'll end up spending 10x Effort to understand same topics.\n└── That's not the prob, I have a list of skills I need to learn(soft skills). These teachers don't allow me to open laptop or tab during class,  even C class they want us to write the code and open laptop \"only when mam asks\". I am aiming for 8+ cgpa,\nThat's enough for me. I can get that by studying 1 week before the exams. So I don't want to sit in class and waste time staring at the board. I don't understand what these teachers teach anyway. I do better when I study myself."
