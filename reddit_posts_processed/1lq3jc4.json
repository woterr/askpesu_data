  "title": "[Rant] Looking for Roommate : Just Want Peace, Code, and No Drama – MCA PES",
  "content": "Since our MCA program kicks off this October, I’m looking for a roommate who’s on the same wavelength as me.\n\n# A bit about me:\n\n* I mostly like staying indoors unless I really need to step out.\n* After finishing my BCA, I worked in tech for a year, but now I’m doing MCA to aim for better opportunities and a higher package.\n* I chose PES because it’s ranked among the top 3 colleges in Karnataka in MCA— felt like the right move.\n* Not much of a socializer — I talk when I have to, but I prefer keeping to myself.\n* I’m quietly active on Reddit(this is my temp reddit account), GitHub, X (Twitter), and LeetCode — I just like to stay low-key and anonymous.\n\nDuring BCA, I somehow ended up doing **5 team projects** because people kept referring me — and I just couldn’t say no. That’s still a habit I’m trying to break. I help people even when I don’t want to, and sometimes that leaves me feeling used. So this time, I want to keep my distance from people who drain my energy or take advantage.\n\nIf you’re someone who values **peace, focus, and personal space**, hit me up. We can figure out a shared PG or flat if it works out",
