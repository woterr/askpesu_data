The best thing you can possibly do is not think about it at all, maximize your college experience, be happy, learn things. Placements will come eventually. You can deal with it when they do. Now is not the time"

      "body": "2018 batch alumni here. Like you mentioned it's top early for anyone to comment about 2029. Anyone talking about 2029 is just making uninformed predictions. No one can say this with confidence and this concern about recession and poor job market has always been the case with every batch. Everyone batch thinks that their placement season are the worst. \n\nI would say just take it easy.Also, I know a lot of PESU students are the same as you who will always have a feeling of unrealised potential. My strong suggestion is to focus on one project. Nothing fancy but something you can be deeply involved with for the upcoming years. Try understanding multiple domains but ensure that you pick one domain which can sail your boat in the interview. Think of the company coming to hire you.The interviewer hardly knows 10 things about the buzzwords mentioned in your project. It just signals delusion and fluffy filled resume. But if you just mention one single strong project, the interviewer gets impressed with the single focussed effort and you also feel confident in the interview. It can be anything from ML Project, Web development project or blockchain or even IOT. \n\nI am saying this with a lot of sincerity and a little bit of authority. I don't do college interviews anymore but I know how companies think while hiring freshers and also understand how we as students are all scattered and confused with high aspirations but ultimately end up with fluffy mentioned in the resume. Also, please practice DS algo. I can't emphasize more on this. Even now I am being asked DS algo questions almost 8 years after graduation for top roles at top companies.\n└── Hi Anna, 28 batch here. Could you suggest some good domains to explore? I’m strong in math and would like to work on a project with real-time applications and potential business value..\n    └── I would suggest you to go with some ML or Data science oriented project which solves a real problem since you are strong at math. Own this single project from scratch. Setup the IDE,codebase everything from scratch. You have all the time in this world. I would not suggest working on a team for this project because it just shifts accountability if one of you is not serious.\n        └── 🫡 \n\nThanks a lot for your inputs! Got the validation I needed to start 😶‍🌫️"
