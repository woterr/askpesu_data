Have a look at how your peers have performed and how the class has performed as a whole , that should give you some idea as to what should be your next steps .\nPs: don't sit and think relative grading will save your ass , it may or it may NOT\n├── Will the class average be given in the app?\n│   └── Cause I only found the total average\n│       └── As far as I know , the average being shown in the app is itself the class average .\nI think , I'm not exactly sure .\n│           └── Ohh like the bar graph is for the entire people who gave the exam and average is for class?\n│               └── It's for everyone who gave the exam\n\nWhile reviewing the isa you can see the average of your section\n│                   └── Okay thankyou!\n└── u/Turbulent-Spinach360 This answer resonates with mine. However I will also add that scoring less doesn't mean you are below par or whatever.. after first year just 60% are above 7.75 gpa , also make use of your time judiciously during the first year learn ,play and enjoy.. going ahead you will have no time."

So don't worry, you can always improve with time! \n\nOne ISA doesn't doom you to losing 8.5 forever. More than a year of bad marks can do that."
