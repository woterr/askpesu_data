There’s a lot more competition though so you really have to be among the top students to make the most of it. I don’t know much about the new courses you mentioned at bms and msrit but i'd rather not take these random specialization courses that colleges seem to throw around these days\n\nmost of the teachers at PES aren’t any good - similar to bms, msrit, and other tier-2 colleges."
