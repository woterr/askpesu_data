  "content": "So after years of GPA battles, all-nighters, and existential crises over compiler errors and deadlines, I finally hit a solid CG and landed my dream placement. Naturally, I was excited (who wouldn’t be?) and thought, “Hey, maybe I’ll share this win with the community!”\n\nBig mistake. Huge.\n\nPosted it — wholesome, no flexing, just good vibes. Boom. Removed by the mods. Guess the idea of someone being happy and succeeding was just too much to handle.\n\nMaybe my CG triggered them. Maybe my offer letter gave someone flashbacks. Or maybe the sheer audacity of not failing violated some sacred subreddit rule I didn’t know existed.\n\nSo yeah, if you’re struggling and want to see people actually make it to the other side? Sorry, not allowed. Gotta keep the vibes miserable and the bar low, apparently.\n\nTo the mods: sorry for achieving things. I’ll try to fail more next time. 😌",
