But, thought I'd start a sub to get it rolling. The only comms that PESU has as of now are noticeboards, whatsapp forwards and a lot of facebook pages. Will this catch on? I hope it does.",

Never got around to working on the CSS and promoting this sub-reddit. Which semester are you in?\n    └── Semester 2 so I’m pretty sure I’ll have enough time to work on the subreddit. I’ve also learned CSS and basic web design so I could do that too. Also, congratulations!"
