Yes\n\nBE/BTech in AI? No\n\nYou'll be learning the basics of AI,ML,DL & Gen AI/LLM at max. Anyhow the college will teach you DS,Algos,CN,OS COA & other subjects which are important for Interviews & higher education\n                └── Ohh okayy 🧐 so I can take aiml just to complete btech ? And move on with software engineering?\n                    └── Yea why not?\n\nJust like what everyone said,AIML/ISE & etc were introduced so colleges can milk more money from CSE seats\n                        └── Yeahh I meant is it hard to manage both for cgpa ? I heard aiml is kinda tough soo\n                            ├── For the academics\n                            │   └── I heard 95% of core cse syllabus is now merged with aiml is that true?\n                            └── AIML is just CSE-Hardwarw+AI subjects. TBH It should be easy to maintain good CGPA in AI compared to Elec subjects like Microcontrollers or other complex subjects like Cryptography which CSE offers. And it mostly depends on your faculty too.\n                                └── Hoo okayy"

The crowd is bad and the college takes little to no initiatives in any sort of industry connects plus, placements suck. PES ecc aiml is 100% better than new horizon cse. You can still do anything a cse core student can do. Companies do not treat you any differently in terms of opportunities.\n└── Alright thanks I'll consider this 🦅🦅"
