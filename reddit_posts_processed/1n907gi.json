  "content": "Hi, I’m in 2nd year CSE with a CGPA of 4.98 and an M2 backlog. How much will this affect placements later? What can I do to improve my CGPA from now on? Also, in ISA/ESA, are marks given only for the written answers or do previous grades matter? Any advice would help.",

I’ll focus on clearing my backlog first and pushing my CGPA closer to 7\n└── Wdym by only eligible for handful of companies? Are i talking about active backlogs? What if we clear the backlog? Idk pls tell"

Focus on clearing it in the ESAs this semester, and try and get your GPA to around the 6.5ish range. That's the minimum for campus placements.\n└── Thanks for the tip—I’ll clear the backlog in ESAs this semester and aim for a 6.5 GPA for placements."
