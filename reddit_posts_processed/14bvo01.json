Don't go for gaming laptops(they tend to have good specs for the cost ) , they have very less battery backup and are very heavy to carry unless you are into gaming .\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Some were telling me macbook couldnt run certian apps? Is it true?\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Macs not really ideal for pes curriculum. Mfs keep giving MS/DOS apps(windows) especially in first year .\nâ”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ We had a course called computer Networks in 4th sem, none of the Mac students could complete their labs.. it was ridiculous. Also getting vms to run on windows is a breeze compared to mac\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ I haven't come across any applications as such in my three years here .\nâ””â”€â”€ Please don't buy MacBook, especially for cse , getting some programs to run on it is an absolute pain. I would suggest Lg gram or Asus vivobook pro."

Anyways if you're buying Apple, wait till you get your student id and make sure you avail student discount"
