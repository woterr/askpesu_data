Even seniors or some of my very smart peers or peers with great relationships with teachers don't know. Honestly just write exams as well as you can and then chill.\n    │   └── I'm asking for subs which doesn't have relative grading..\n    │       ├── Bro first of all stop relying on relative grading. They do it sometimes, and sometimes I dont. I'm from the '27 batch and first sem we had hard relative grading. Even idiots who dont study shit scored 8+. 2nd sem we had relative only for math, and everyone's sgpa dropped. So like I said, just study hard and do ur best. The only subject where you can expect relative is math because people generally mess up, but even then don't be too hopeful.\n    │       └── If there was no relative then 90 and above is S grade\n    └── They could. Nobody knows the cutoff. Just study"
