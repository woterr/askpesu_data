This should just give you a rough estimate of what to expect.\nAlso this has been asked so many times ðŸ˜­, go through faq's and prev posts before posting your questions."

I guess it depends on vacancy and some other factors.\nâ””â”€â”€ Yeah they've introduced this internal sliding option, where based on your GPA and vacancy students can shift branches after the first year. It's like a mini counselling all over again.\n    â””â”€â”€ Shifting branches I know but shifting collage locations?"
