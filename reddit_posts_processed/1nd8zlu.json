Not a single soul?\n\nBut the rest of the stats do seem about right"

      "body": "Why tf do they use the 7.75 and 8.75 as the bracket opening? This is is really annoying since it groups guys will 7.8 and 8.7 in one bracket and gives you placement percentages. If your gpa is between 7.75-8 there's no real advantage you have over 7.5 guys , so you can't really trust the statistics of a group that includes guys with 8.5+ gpas. If your gpa is 7.75-8 you might as well consider yourself in the 6.75-7.75 bracket?"
