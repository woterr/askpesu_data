I have sent the documents through courier, the last date of surrender is 7th July and 9th July is the 1st Iteration Of Bits, there is a small chance i might get msc so any help in extension of seat surrendering date would be helpful, i was reading they charge 2k per day if crossed the surrender date please if any senior or anyone can help me regarding this that would be really appreciated.",
