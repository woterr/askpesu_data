Assuming your topic is very new and isn’t backed with enough published results (or you haven’t kept your guide in the loop)……and your panel has some hidden agenda against you, I would assume they will torture you till ESA project review and tell you to start all over again from the next semester.\n└── In that case what grade does one end up with\n    └── C or D mostly. I don’t know anyone who has failed."
