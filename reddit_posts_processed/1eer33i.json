But if i get some other branch in RR or EC campus through KCET or even CSE itself in EC campus through KCET, then what?, will the fees be revised, can i surrender my PESSAT seat and join through KCET in PES in some other branch? \n\nThey also said that if i surrender my seat before PESSAT 2nd round councelling, then ill get most of my money back, but PESSAT 2nd round is mostly going to before KCET 2nd round, if i dont surrender my seat before 2nd PESSAT round and then get smtg in KCET 2nd round and surrender then, how much of the money will they return, basically what is the return policy? \n\nMy KCET rank: 5738\nMy PESSAT rank: 720",

      "body": "You need to surrender the seat before PESSAT 2nd round counseling to get an admission via K-cet .\nYou can enquire about Return policy in pes college.\nBasically Fee through PESSAT admission should be around 4.5lakh to 5lakh (not sure) while through K-cet is 1lakh around . So maybe u might get 3 lakh or 4 lakh  back if u get a seat through K-cet . \n\nI am not sure about the return policy going on right now this year . \n\nFirst of all , u secured a good rank Congratulations 👏. If u wait till 2nd extended round in K-cet , u can mostly get CS in PES (RR campus) . If u get other branch in RR or EC campus based on the fee structure of other branch ur amount will be returned back . However if u have taken admission through PESSAT right now and later get CS in EC campus the the same amount like around 3lakh or 4lakh  might be returned back ( I am not very sure about the amount). \n\nJust discuss about the return policy in PES college , they will explain the details.\nBut I personally suggest u to wait for Kcet 2nd extended round , u may get CS in PES (RR campus) .\n\nALL THE BEST\n└── But by the time 2nd round and 2nd round extended happens PESSAT 2nd round will be over, if I give up my seat after that, idk how much money they'll return, also if I get smtg other Cse in RR or ECE then wht happens also idk, I need to know these\n    └── Irrespective of the course u get in RR campus , they will return ur money back . ( How much money will be returned , u better have to talk with faculty in college)\n\nIf u r not so confident abt giving up on ur PESSAT seat . Better apply for Electronics and communication engineering (ECE) in RR campus . \nFor sure , u get ECE in PES through K-cet . \n\nIn 2nd year of ur engineering, there is an option called \" branch change\" , based on ur 1st year CGPA u can change ur branch to AIML or CSE in RR campus only . U need to have above 9 CGPA to change ur branch to CSE or AIML.\n        └── I'm not confident abt giving up on my PESSAT seat at all broo, tht's the reason for my confusion\n            └── I too study in PES , EC campus \n\nIf u r not confident about giving up on ur seat .\nBetter take up the high probability. \nFor 5.7k rank in K-cet , u will surely get ECE in RR campus .\nU can apply for ECE now and join through K-cet.\nU need to work 1st year hard and get a good cgpa of above 9\nIn second year , there is chance to change ur branch .\nU can try to shift for CSE or AIML in the same campus or EC campus .\n                └── Last yr even in 2nd round RR Ece cutoff wws 3803 broo\n                    └── RR ECE 2nd round cutoff for G1(General category) is 14k\n                        └── 1G? Shouldn't we check GM rank?\n                            └── Depends on ur caste .\n( Caste is really confusing in K-cet , know well which u belong to ). \nIf u really GM , i suggest u to stick with PESSAT admission.\n                                └── Ok so how do i find out which one am I?\n                                    └── It happened same with me , I went to college along with my parents to talk abt it , they helped me out .\n\nIn general there are many groups , staff will guide u .\nBetter visit the campus soon and figure out\n                                        └── Like PES campus u mean?"
