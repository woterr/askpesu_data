So I just wanted to know what are some things that you regret not knowing before joining or is there anything from 11th and 12th that I should be revising so that I won't have trouble getting back to academics after such a long break, or should I just continue to enjoy the break because the college will take \"good care\" of me later",

You studied inChaitanya /narayana\nAm I right?\n│   │   └── Yh😅🥲\n│   ├── What's ip ? Do cs50 ig\n│   ├── IP 11th std. Syllabus is more aligned to the Python course; so, doing a good revision of just that should keep you prepared for the first two units [approx 50% of the syllabus]\n│   └── IP gets your java basics you will have ease in python, go for cs 50 or even better Google Python for everyone or py4e.com that will be your python syllabus you got videos and codes to practice \n\nApart from that read about various kind of tech, not over a 50,000 ft a little more detailed technology of various type works. Just random good youtube channel\n\nAlso , 3blue1brown. Google that.\n└── Revising the IP 11th std. Syllabus is good enough for the first two units of the Python course; 12th std. chapters are good if you want to do some skill-building\n    └── Is it better to start with c Or python\n        └── The college will start with Python most probably in the 1st sem, and then they'll do C in the 2nd sem; So starting with Python will be better"
