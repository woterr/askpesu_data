After first year you get put into sections in your branch.\n\n\nNone of the classes in first year are AIML because first year courses are the same for everyone (in the same cycle). Branch wise classes are all from 2nd year onward\n├── ohk thanks boss\n├── >only change once after first year ends, after that they remain the same until graduation.

For you guys I'm guessing slight shuffle in 2nd sem too because of the large gaps between PESSAT and different rounds of KCET"
