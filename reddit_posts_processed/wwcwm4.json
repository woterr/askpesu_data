But my rank in cet is enough for some specialisations(like ise) and not cse so I'm sticking with pes through pessat. Don't take ise when you have the option of cse in a similar college, ise is seen as a subset of cse.\n├── Sounds pretty right..Thanks for the reply!\n└── What should I choose between bmsce and msrit?\n    └── Hey man, what did you choose? Same situation for me, got 1.6k rank in comedk and debating bms vs msrit. Can I DM you?\n        └── what did u choose?"

However, going to multiple fests and club events in other colleges, I would say PES has much better quality....\n└── Thanks for the reply! ^^\n\nI am  'okay'  if it's simply study focused coz I am not that good of a social person ..Just free time is all I need to explore my interests, personality dev, competitive coding etc  \nBut recently they are like keeping exams every 2nd / 3rd week + assignments\n    └── I didn't have the entire 5 ISAs BS, but I planned my day well and i did get time for personal development and also courses...\n\nI feel, you too can plan it out in PES and get the best of both worlds\n        └── Yaa , will do it for sure..\nApart from that PESians are always there for help be it reddit , quora , insta I find them everywhere..\nThanks ;)\n            └── PES domination 🤌\n                └── True 🤭"

Pes is simply an extension of your school. For me college shouldn't be just studies but of an exploration of oneself!\n└── Noted ..Thanks ! 🤝"

      "body": "Not sure about the current placements at BMS, but a few (2-3) years ago PES had much better offers coming it's way. Assuming things are still the same, then PES should have better placements with higher median packages being offered. \n\nHowever as a college, BMSCE is better rounded and won't be as academically focused at PES. You'll get more free time to explore your interests and work on other things, unlike here where after 1st year you'll be grinding non stop week after week because of the absurd number of tests, assignments etc you'll have to finish per week. \n\nI'd suggest you to do a little research on the placements at BMS for the '22 and '21 batch and notice the trend. If you see that the median packages are comparable or a little lesser, then pick BMS.\n├── Will look into it , Thanks for the detailed reply ...\n└── how would you rank PES Cse ( electronic city campus) vs BMS Ai/Ml vs MSRIT AI/ML???\r  \n\r  \nlike i understand it isn't wise to take specialization branches but I've heard that Pes is very hectic and but I've heard Bms is more chill. Also, will AI/ML students be allowed to sit with Cse and Ise for placements??\n    └── They're allowed to sit but taking core cse will be a better option anyday over specialisations\n        └── That's good to know , thanks!"
