With that said, here are the worse ones, from worst to tolerable: \n\nLakshmeesha - ML\nShilpa - DBMS\nShilpa - C\nSurbhi - DDCO\nShantala - DDCO\nShantala - MPCA\nUddoshi - EPD\nNeha - OS\nJenny - Cloud Computing\n\nI also want to talk about the best ones. From best to good: \n\nSandesh - DSA\nAnimesh - Big Data\nGowri - Compiler Design\nLokesh - Electrical\nPrajwala - any subject she takes. DDCO, MPCA, Data Analytics\nKundhavai - Go\nFaisal - Physics\nMath - shivashankari\n├── faisal?!? thanks to his slides i got an s in physics?\n├── Udoshi i heard is goated though?\n├── Animesh sir ?? , but he teaches CN well\n├── Is this the same lakshmeesha from CIE ?\n└── Shantala ma'am and Jeny ma'am aren't that bad though.. 😭\n\n  \nAlso Arti Arya ma'am is definitely one of the best!!\n\nI have her this time for gen ai and I'm not going to lie I wasn't too keen about the subject until I actually attended her class. She seems genuinely interested in the subject and it makes me look forward to her classes as well :D\n\n\n\nOthers I would add to the best category:  \nSangam Sir - Electronics\n\nRevanasidappa Sir- Chemistry"
