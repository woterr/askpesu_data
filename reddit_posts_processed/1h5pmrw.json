Except math i didn't made any..🥲\n            └── F\n                └── honestly it can be hard to pay attention in class when most teachers are terrible at their job. i feel like i've learned most subjects on my own."

If you have a resource to prepare from, why not use it? You should know by now that scoring well at PES isn't easy and requires hard work and time. Cover as many resources as you can. Its the only way to do well here.\n\n3. Check this subreddit, it was posted literally a few days ago along with a video tutorial. There are no solutions.\n├── Okk thanks👍\n└── What resource tho?"
