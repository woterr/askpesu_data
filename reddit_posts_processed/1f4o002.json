  "content": "Hi! I might get RR AIML through PESSAT and EC CS through KCET. It has been mentioned in the PESSAT counselling page that PESSAT fees are refunded if the KCET seat has the same campus and branch. I wanted to know how much it would cost me to pick my KCET seat over my PESSAT after second round of KCET counselling, which very well could be different than my PESSAT seat.",
