      "body": "It's easier than the exams that CS people have but it's definitely a hard subject. In ISA, you'll have a mix of coding and theory questions. Most will be MCQs but you'll have a few descriptive questions too. Your teachers will share some material with you, like videos and lab programs, those are the best ones to study to get an S imo. If you're in EC campus, just do whatever Chavan sir sends properly and you'll be set. DSA is the hardest subject in minors and one of the hardest CSE subjects as well so it's not easy getting an S. But if you practice the repeated programs and the theory part properly, you should be able to do it\n└── thank you!!"
