Number of people who pass in Backlog is not even 10% of total backlog exam attendees. Whatever it takes. Just pass the subject. Especially maths or electrical.\n└── How many people generally give backlog?\n    ├── So around 40-50 fail maths everytime. And if i combine all subjects then around 90-100 ish people will have backlog in at least one subject per batch. So just multiply that by 3 or 4 batches \n    └── A lot"
