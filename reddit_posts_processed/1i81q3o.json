  "content": "I am in Btech sem 4 and my FAM mentor has started ignoring me.  \n\nEarlier she used to call me to FAM meeting and used to say \"Come to FAM meeting u are already late\"  but slowly and gradually she started paying less and less attention to me. \nWe have a FAM group and there she used to call all the people by roll number who were late.  \n\nDuring sem 3 she stopped calling me but she called all other people who  were late. I thought maybe it was just a mistake. \n\nBut during second  fam meeting in sem 3 she didnt even care to make me sign those attendance sheets. She completly ignored me. \nI thought ok maybe she will call me later but no.\n\nSo when i came to sem 4 i was very happy . New sem new beginnigs so maybe now she will start to pay attention to me but now she dosent even mention me on the FAM message on list of absentees. Its like i dont exist anymore \n\nI feel i am worthless and i dont deserve any attention or care. \n\nI think its the end.\n\nIt will show her that i exist.",
