That used to be the easiest Sem 8 special topic by far\n└── How would you compare MOOC course with department one?\n    ├── I never took one, but some of my classmates did. Some of those IIT/IISC MOOC courses were not good and had fuckall professors giving really difficult assignments and exams.\n\nIt’s quite variable. Department courses in the final sem are generally pretty peaceful, atleast from my experience.\n    └── I wouldn't recommend the MOOC courses. PES is known to even change the syllabus for some of these courses claiming the original syllabus isn't enough. It's more of a hassle than convenience. The remaining reasons have already been listed by the other commenter."
