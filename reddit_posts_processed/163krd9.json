It's definitely better than most CS curriculums in other Bangalore colleges, which are incredibly outdated. \n\nHowever, is the syllabus *updated*? Barely. PES sacrifices quality for quantity when it comes to putting the latest topics in the syllabus - a lot of courses will contain a slide or two at max of the \"updated\" concepts. So yes, although the syllabus is great, it barely passes to be called updated since it just introduces the concept's name and does not go into its details, hence why I called it superficial in nature.\n\nIf you have doubts regarding the credibility of my answers, the other comments on this thread and sub should be enough to settle your doubts about it.\n    â”œâ”€â”€ oh thanks man, i had made the post just to confirm your point with others\n    â””â”€â”€ Downvoted"
