I can't imagine travelling 20km on outer ring road and not be tired 💀\n                    └── Fr💀, the alternative is to come thru main road(I live near rr campus and travel to ecc), it's only 20kms but costs more than nice because of the shit mileage I'll get in traffic. \n\nAnd the stress, my god. Nice is a godsend."
