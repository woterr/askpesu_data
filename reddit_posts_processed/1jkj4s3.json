  "content": "So, I was randomly scrolling through social media when I came across the name **Vikas Chinmay (J Section)**. Turns out, he’s from *our own college* (PES)! What caught my attention? He published a book at just **20 years old**, and guess what? It was dedicated to his ex-girlfriend! Like, who even does that? 😮\n\nOut of curiosity, I looked deeper and found that he even wrote another book called *\"Why This Degree?\"* (relatable, lol). And the craziest part? He never reveals his face—just his name. But I found out he’s from **J section**.\n\nI read his book, and honestly? **It’s really cute and inspiring.** 🥹 This guy seems super motivated, hardworking, and just different.\n\nBut let’s talk about that ex-girlfriend… **Ananya**, girl, what did you do?? 🫠 How did you let go of someone like him? He literally sounds like a dream.\n\nAnyone else heard about him? Or is it just me going down this rabbit hole? 👀",

I'll let your batchmates take over and ridicule you in the comments.\n└── bro how do you have the time to respond to almost every other post being an entire timezone away and also packed with stuff to do ! i myself cant do that and i am just in the first year\n    └── I usually check reddit only at specific times during the day, maybe 2-3 times. But when I do check, I glance through all the recent posts and comments and comment wherever needed. So it appears that I am always online but its just that I don't normally \"scroll\" reddit unless I have nothing to do - 90% of the time I open reddit, its to check if anything needs my attention on r/PESU. Which is also why if you check when my comments are made, a bulk of them are at specific times during the day (morning, evening, late night)\n        └── bros doing side quests here   \nalso like have you seen any of your batchmates do well post pesu with not a great cgpa like between 8 to 8.5\n            └── do well as in do well in life / get a good salary post pesu   \ni saw the placement sheets - ppl with 9 plus gpa also get like 11 -12 lpa   \nmeanwhile ppl with like around 8.5 plus minus get like 20 plus lpa   \nsome also get into good uni's\n\nalso you know anyone in your batch doing mba from a good uni after pesu ?\n                ├── Pretty sure someone or the other will be doing their MBA now, but I'm not in touch with anyone personally who is doing so. And yes, people are generally doing well, there are many in the US for their MS also with 8-8.5 GPA\n                │   └── oh thats nice to hear, gives some solace\n                └── I’m (batch of 2017) currently doing an MBA in the USA. Happy to talk if you have any questions"
