It is possible, but requires you to go through several bureaucratic hurdles (approval from both dept HODâ€™s, suitable time for presentation etc). \n\nSo to answer your question: Yes, you can do your capstone in another department but some part of it should contain what youâ€™ve learnt in your department"
