That's why it's crucial to ensure you're always well prepared for both ISAs and ESA.\n└── well...it was there in 2020 or 2021...something like improvement exam ..but that was last time (i am (2019-2023)batch)\n    └── That was an exception because of COVID. It was set up because classes were completely online, ESAs offline and they gave us the option to give the ESAs at the scheduled time or later."
