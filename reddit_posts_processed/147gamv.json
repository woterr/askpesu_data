As for placements, in all likelihood you'll end up with a SWE job itself and the branch won't help you land an ML related one.\n├── thanks for the reply \n\nmy intentions are not to land an ML related role\n\ni was considering it because my rank doesnt get me core cse\n│   └── I guess AI/ML will be closer to CSE as compared to ECE\n├── To all the juniors out there. Here me out loud and clear. THIS POST IS PURE GOLD AND EVERYTHING THIS MAN'S WRITTEN IS BULLS EYE. Literally every alphabet in this post makes sense. Don't fall for the hype. Avoid FOMO (which i know aint easy for kids joining college intially).\n├── Can u please specify the courses that are being replaced by PESU. Also if I learn these courses separately will that make a difference\n│   └── Digital design has been replaced with SoC. Computer Architecture with Big Data. This is what we know of so far. Learning it separately won't make a difference for higher education because they still will look at your grades in all courses you've taken at undergrad, that's when they see that something is missing.\n\nUnfortunately I can't comment on which branch is better, I don't really know enough about the other to suggest anything.\n│       └── i got aiml in 2nd round, should i wait till 2nd extended round to get cse..... pls help urgent!\n├── Rvce cs specialisation (except aiml) or pes cs rr? I'm very confused please help me out here\n│   └── Most points above apply to *any* specialisation. Core CS >>> specialisation.\n└── I get cs core in dsce so its better off to choose that instead of cs specialization in pes??"

PES also is proud about the \"dynamic\" curriculum so you should expect changes. \n\nThe placements should be similar but not as good as CS. See a few other posts in the subreddit I believe they go more in-depth.\n\nOverall I'd say go for CS in EC campus over AIML in RR.\n└── How similar is AIML to CSE?\n    └── 60% cse 40% aiml. basically the electives you can choose to pursue with cse core are now aiml.

I'm running out of town and can't make it but I'd appreciate if anyone has done the deed and ready to share here.\n    └── Apparently they haven't made the proper syllabus yet because the branch started only last year"
