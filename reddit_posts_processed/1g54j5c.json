Regardless, most friendships are formed through common events like clubs and other activities, so if you take part in different things you'll automatically make friends with similar interests. \n\nOr as they say, wait for an extrovert to adopt you.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ I shall waitðŸ˜­\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ It's not that difficult to find people lol. You're going to have to come out of that shell sooner or later. Once you put yourself out there a little bit, it becomes increasingly easier.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ This.\nCan't express how true this is.\nWhatsApp and Discord are for building your network beyond your interests.\nEvents are for finding like minded people.\n\n\nDiscord is always there to help anyone, anyone who's willing to meet new people.\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ I'll check that out thanks\nâ””â”€â”€ It's all fun and games until someone doxxs you in the same whatsapp group\n    â””â”€â”€ True, but give it a while and sooner or later all your friends and even strangers around you will know your identity on discord.\n        â””â”€â”€ Bro's talking from experience. (I know who you are, but I'll keep it to myself :))"
