After all its 50% of PCM boards right \n\nMeanwhile us in other boards gonna get screwed eitherway cuz paper level is surely tougher than State Board and add to that this \"extra\" chances part ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚\nâ””â”€â”€ True lol this year my paper went really badÂ \n    â””â”€â”€ Oh shit....  \nHow did your PESSAT go if you wrote it?\n        â”œâ”€â”€ it was a bit better  i ended up getting ece in rr campus\n        â””â”€â”€ Everywhere the board results are considered for eligibility. There too state students will have upper hand\n            â””â”€â”€ Though it sounds unfair . Im happy it is like that . I dont want to compete with outsiders for college like I compete for property lol.\n                â””â”€â”€ Just imagine the plight of Karnataka students studying in cbse boards.\n                    â””â”€â”€ Out of curiosity, why did you take cbse?\n\n\nI too studied cbse till 10th, and switched to state board for this reason."
