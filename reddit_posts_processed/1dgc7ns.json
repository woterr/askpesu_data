But academics is more hectic.\n├── What about the sports clubs?\n│   └── Yes sports is good here. \n└── Are the placements better with RV CS(specialisation) or PES CS?\n    └── The advantage with RV is the competition is much lower as fewer number of students. So if you are willing to compete you can get really good offers here. Otherwise RV is better "
