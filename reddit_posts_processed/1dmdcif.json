  "content": "\n\nI've recently enrolled at PES University and I'm eager to start off on the right foot. Could anyone share insights on what subjects/topics are covered in the first-year syllabus for Computer Science. Also, any recommendations on what I should study beforehand to excel in my first year and potentially aim to be a topper?\n\nAny advice or tips would be greatly appreciated! Thank you.\n  ",

It's best to enjoy it for now. \n\nIf you do want to pick up things, take a look at the MIT Missing Semester course. It covers a lot of useful topics that CS engineers should know, but aren't part of any CS syllabus.\n\nAlso, being a topper is a good aim but unfortunately a pointless one. Anything above a certain CGPA is pretty much the same when it comes to opportunities. You're better off having a 9.0 CGPA with a strong list of experiences and projects rather than a 10.0 with nothing else to show. If you want to get placed, you're going to have to be more than your CGPA."
