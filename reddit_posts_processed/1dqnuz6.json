  "content": "Blockchain hasn’t seen a change in the grade graph after reval results are out. Despite being a dead easy elective, somehow only 4 people got an S?? \n\nI got 42 in internals and I know I didn’t lose the ~20 odd marks in ESA I’d have had to to get the B I got (which hasn’t changed after putting for reval). I know other people in a similar range of marks who’ve got A\n\nSeniors is there any way to take this further? I’m on the brink of 8 CGPA so this is p important to me",

It's possible they haven't graded on a curve but there only 4 people who got an S so, they should've?\n\nWhat a joke.\n└── Even without grading on a curve you’d have to lose a fair amount to get a B also love the username"
