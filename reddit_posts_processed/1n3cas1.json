I mainly code in Java, but noticed some JDs mention C/C++/Python, so I was wondering if itâ€™s still fine to apply with Java as my strength. \n(With respect to IBM)\nâ””â”€â”€ Same doubt here,nearly 6 of them had c/c++\n    â””â”€â”€ True, but I think as long as weâ€™re strong in problem solving and passing all the test cases, the language shouldnâ€™t matter much. Still, maybe worth checking with seniors who sat for IBM last year?"
