Academics are definitely rigorous and they take up most of your time, but if you manage your time well, you can have a lot of fun. There are many events that happen on campus and a few good (not great) fests. It's not like how colleges are shown in tv/movies so you're going to have to keep that in mind. The key is to find a group of friends that vibes with you and makes the place feel worth it."
