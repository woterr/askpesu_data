PES offers a CS specialisation while the others are specialised degrees.\n└── So in pes we'll be getting b tech in cs with specialization in AiML right???\n    └── PES offers a BTech in CS-AIML. This is a CS specialisation or CS-allied branch. \n\nThe others offer BTech in AIML/DS/etc. This is a specialised branch itself.\n        └── Ok. Among core cs in colleges like uvce and cs-aiml in pes which one do you think is better??\n            └── I don't know enough about UVCE. If you want to compare just the branches, check the FAQs pinned on this subreddit.\n                └── Okay . Thank you very much"
