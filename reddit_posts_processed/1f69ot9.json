      "body": "I've been trying to pay through the \"pay online\" option and it takes me to the login page, I'm assuming it doesn't work cuz even in the guidelines and stuff, they've mentioned only payment through challan... We've just decided to pay through that challan option cuz we don't want to waste any time, please let me know if the \"pay online\" option starts working\n├── I was a bit skeptical about the \"Pay Online\" option too because it clearly says that KEA isn't responsible for double payments and stuff so I don't wanna risk it. I might go with the Challan too. Could you tell me the payment process through Challan? \n\nFrom what I've read, all I have to do is sign on it -> take the challan to one of the 3 banks they've mentioned -> probably enter our account details and after the transaction the admission order should be visible on the website?\n│   └── Yes, then you need to take the admission order to the college before 5th sept to confirm your admission\n├── Also I did try clicking on the 'Pay Online' option and it takes me to an net banking web page where I have to again click \"Pay Now\". Idk why you're being redirected to the login page 🤔\n│   └── Oh, I have no idea either, we'll try a few times today and if it doesn't work then we'll probably do the challan thing tomorrow\n│       └── Sure let me know what worked for you!\n│           └── Sure\n├── the online thing is supposed to work they mentioned it in the brochure\n│   ├── Oh, I'll go through it again\n│   └── Have you paid online?\n└── Same "

      "body": "Hey\nI was finally able to reach the payment page and we paid the fees online successfully, there wasnt any problem that we faced, so I think it should be safe 👍🏻\n└── Hey thanks for letting me know. Can you tell me what happened after you clicked the blue \"Pay Now\" button? Also are you able to download your admission letter?\n    └── 1. After clicking \"pay now\" it took me to the page where all my details were there, like name, cet number and so on and asked me how i'd like to pay - either through the bank account details way or net banking (I chose net banking)\n2. After the payment was done, it didn't show if it was successful, so we panicked a little but we logged out and logged in again and we were shown that the payment was made and the link to download the admission order was activated. So yes, I was able to download the admission order.\n3. I'm not really aware of this point... What exactly is a student and a college copy?\n4. Yes, I was able to download the receipt and we took a print out too\n        └── Ahh i see glad it worked out. Regarding the 3rd point, the challan has 3 sections to it. Namely, bank copy, candidate copy and college copy. The bank will take the bank copi and we'll get the candidate copy and we have to give PES the college copy when we go for docs. submission. I think for you, the \"college copy\" will be equal to the receipt of the payment 🤷🏻‍♂️\n            └── Maybe, I just checked pes official website for all the documents required when we go to the college to confirm our admission through cet and just made sure I got all of it"
