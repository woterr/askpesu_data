To build any kind of application/product, you will need to focus on multiple fields. Hackathons are built to also help you develop your organisational and planning abilities, the way you split up functionalities, duties and roles and how well you integrate different components together. While its not impossible to attempt a hackathon alone, but it is a pretty big task and you might not have the necessary skillset to cover all the fields required to build your idea. Additionally, its way more fun doing it with your friends and is more rewarding when you integrate what everyone has been working on independently!  \n\n\nBut to answer your question - nope as far as I know. Usually there is a 2-4 member requirement"
