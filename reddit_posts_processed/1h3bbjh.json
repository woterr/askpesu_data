I got 20 20 in both ISA and still ended up with 8 , but that was because I got S in python so I could afford not studying mechanics.\n\nDon't get too relaxed tho. Try getting 30+. Some of us realise too late that it's not actually that hard to get 25+ , you don't have to be some genius , it's purely a matter of consistency in PES\n├── for placements will they consider the avg of all cgpa?\n└── shouldn't it be 30-35 in isa2 and 90+in ESA??\n    └── Well , 9 is an A grade in every subject , that is an aggregate score of 80+/100 , if you get 35 in isa 2 , 20 in Isa 1 , 10 in assignment and 82 in esa your score will be 81/100 which is an A grade. In every subject that will total to 9 sgpa\n        └── what?? 20 on 40 will be 10 and 35 will be 17,10 from assignment and let's say 90 in ESA so that will be 82 so s grade right??\n            └── *A grade"
