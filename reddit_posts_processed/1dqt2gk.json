  "content": "I got into pesu through management (eee). And I am so scared . I regret every second of my 11th and 12th. I got sick before pessat and couldn't even perform well. And I was really mentally disturbed for almost 1-2 months cause of the regret . I was a good student all my life and I fucked up so bad in 12th. And I took eee cause I wanted that tbh and its 1L more than the fee through pessat and I know it's not worth it but my parents kind of talked me into it and I feel so guilty . I am really ready to work my ass off and get good grades. \nWILL I BE JUDGED BY MY CLASSMATES BY GETTING SEAT THROUGH MANAGEMENT?\n",

Cs in ec campus cutoff was only 7.4 and ece even lower. \n\nYou can definitely do it with the most minimal of efforts. \n\nI know management people who get gpas consistently in the 9s,8s,7s and ones who have multiple backlogs. College is a clean slate, make sure you study hard this time\nâ””â”€â”€ But OP doesn't want a branch change, OP wants EEE itself \n\nBut yes I agree. Some of my friends from management quota used to score 9+ too lol. There's no relation between management quota and how you perform."

Be truthful about it,there is 0 shame and put more effort in 1st year since people good in jee/cet will have advantage. After that it becomes a level playing field:) atb!!"

Genuinely, EEE feels like a family in the later years because of how small we are. It's a great place (sometimes). Just work hard and dont shy away from subjects that are difficult (there's a lot of them). \nFun Fact: I didn't even know some of my batchmates were management kids until a few weeks ago, that's how unbothered we are.\nâ””â”€â”€ how'd u find out lol"

Just do your shit, focus on educating yourself and doing what you like to do. First of all your parents shouldn't have \"talked you into it\" so don't be in fear of disappointing them."

People are usually chill but if anyone starts treating you differently just because you came through management quota then it's a very good sign that you need to stay away from them. Helps weed out the fake ones I suppose."
