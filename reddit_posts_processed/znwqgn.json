      "body": "Your final score for a course is an aggregated score of your ISA+ESA+assignments+project. You need to pass in this final score, not ESA. Your ESA is scaled down from 100 marks to 50 and the remaining components all add up to 50 as well. So theoretically you can get a 0 in ESA and still \"pass\" if you get full in the other.\n└── How exactly is CGPA calculated from all this?\n    └── [Check out my earlier comment for the entire calculation](https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/yup6ok/with_5_isas_whats_the_formula_for_calculating_cgpa/iwatrw9)\n        ├── Ah ok thanks\n        └── What's a safe total aggregate to be considered for passing?\n            └── 35-40 if I'm not wrong. Your final score is out of 100 for every course."
