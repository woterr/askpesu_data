When I wrote PESSAT the questions in my shift were very easy, barely comedk level.\n        â””â”€â”€ 120 for 600 rank in Easy shift ?(you said your shift was easy )\n            â””â”€â”€ I cannot say for sure because they don't release your marks, just the rank. I think there were 180 questions and I answered all of them because there was no negative marking. At least 30 of them would have been mere guesses. Btw I'm not even sure their ranking scheme is legit, I know a complete idiot that had a rank of 400 and a very smart person with 15k. \n\nIf you want CSE in RR campus you'll need rank 1200 or less.\n                â””â”€â”€ I hope this isn't a scam like VIT ðŸ¤¡\nCan I DM you ?\n                    â””â”€â”€ Yeah"
