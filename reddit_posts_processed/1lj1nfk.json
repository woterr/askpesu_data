You can rely on KCET cutoff but only upto second round cutoffs, don't rely on second extended round cutoffs; It varies significantly every year\nâ”œâ”€â”€ I see, that's a relief  \nThanks\\~\nâ””â”€â”€ https://preview.redd.it/ng51u3ojfu8f1.png?width=1126&format=png&auto=webp&s=75ae3e3151137eb941205319d7fb2955f7cbe7ac\n\nJust curious tho, why is there such a big difference between cut off in 2024 and 2023?\n    â””â”€â”€ Every year seats are getting increased so that might be one of the reasons. In some year, the counselling gets delayed, so many people opt out of it, so the cutoff varies a lot. Sometimes even neet counselling finishes before KCET, that's also one of the reasons. All in all there are multiple factors.\n        â””â”€â”€ I see I see  \nthanks!\n            â””â”€â”€ Wlcm ðŸ˜Š\n                â””â”€â”€ Hey!  \n Since you are a 4th year senior, can i dm you to ask stuff bout internships and placements?\n                    â””â”€â”€ Sure"
