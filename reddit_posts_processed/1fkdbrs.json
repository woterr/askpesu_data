Then whats the point of 80% attendence if I can come to college give my attendence and leave\n│   ├── You cant walk out of the class , if you do , you will loose attendance\n│   └── They take attendance every period. You can't just get up and leave in the middle of class lol what did you think?\n│       └── I thought they take attendence only once at the start of the day😂\n│           └── I used to keep my bag outside and if the teacher took attendance early into the class, I'd excuse myself to the washroom and then just take my bag and leave campus. But not easy to do.\n│               └── Oh lol! Then there would be many bags near the library😂\n└── Ye I kinda got bored of bootstrap so I wanted to go but I am roaming in random places instead\n    └── You can honestly just leave. I found bootstrap boring so I understand.\n        └── Ya I am gonna do that thanks"

Only thing that'll get hit is your attendance but if you save up your attendance, you can bunk a lot in the end of the semester\n├── Ya got it thanks I was just kinda exploring campus will do that next time\n└── what is the min % of attendance and what is the clg timins till\n    ├── 75%\n    └── They say 75% but 70% is also fine. It depends on your HoD mainly. I had 51% and all in a sem and nobody asked me anything but CS ppl in my campus had to get a signed affidavit for 70% and stuff"
