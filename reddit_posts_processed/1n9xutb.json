      "body": "Nope, you cannot, rejecting a PPO from a tier will make you ineligible to sit for companies for that tier. As per college, they say that since college has indirectly played a role for that PPO, rejecting it is equivalent to rejecting a direct offer from that tier through placements.\n\nI got a PPO from my company where I did my summer, but the package was tier 2 and the clg had some bs clause which said I cant sit for entire tier 1. So i rejected the PPO and sat for placements in tier 1, but they have told that I cant sit for tier 2 anymore\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Dentsu?\nâ””â”€â”€ How does placement office find out if you got a PPO offer?\n    â””â”€â”€ When companies give the student a PPO, it goes through the placement office only. Company informs placement telling this student(s) has/have gotten a PPO, we need a formal acceptance of the same from the student by replying to this mail and all. So based on that placement decides what to do."

I got it clarified from the placement office before rejecting the PPO.\nâ””â”€â”€ So 100% for sure I can reject a PPO and continue to sit for both internship and fte right? There won't be any problems?\n    â””â”€â”€ Yes"
