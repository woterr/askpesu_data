Nice to know that bugs that existed way back in 2018 are still prevalent today 💀\n\nBut yeah, if it's the same grades showing for everyone then it's a bug at their end. It usually resolves on its own in sometime. \n\nSo don't worry, in all likelihood it isn't your result sheet (unless you're the poor soul who actually got that, in which case F my brother)\n├── The craziest part is my courses are dbms se bd da mi respectively , i got so scared seeing the f grade, i thought it was mi .later i realised that the whole thing is glitched and fked up\n└── Do we get Capstone grade after 6th sem or later ?\n    └── Capstone comprises 3 phases, spread across 6th, 7th and 8th sem. Each phase has 2, 6, and 2 credits respectively (as far as I remember) and therefore each also gets an independent grade at the end of the respective sem.\n        └── So 2 credits after 6th sem ?\n            └── 6th - 2 credits\n7th - 4 credits\n8th - 2 credits\n                └── Thanks :⁠-⁠)"
