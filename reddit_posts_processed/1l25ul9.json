That means I should also submit it ? . How can I get it if I have to submit\n    └── The first line of their comment already specifies - you need to ask your school. As far as I'm aware, all students need to submit it. Get one from your school.\n        └── Should i submit it in the 1st round of counceling itself or can I submit it at the time of joining the college\n            └── The comments above already state you can submit later."
