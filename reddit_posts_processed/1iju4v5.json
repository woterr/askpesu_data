The theoretical minimum atleast would be 9+. An 8.5 is good enough for most companies (atleast 95%)\n    ├── Well, with a disappointed voice I got very less sgpa 7.3 can I still have an cgpa of 9>=0 till the end of 6th sem?\n    │   └── Use the CGPA calculator on the FAQs to track your trajectory. Use the table on sheet 2.\n    └── \\>Ideally you'd want to aim for even higher given that companies have started shortlisting 9+ for interviews lately.  \nis it for most companies or 8.5+ works ?\n        └── 8.5 is enough for most companies. Although the top ones tend to be more strict with GPA"
