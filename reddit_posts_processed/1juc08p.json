They are 2 credit courses so u can calculate the increase in cgpa accordingly and they don't get added to ur current semester's sgpa\n├── Thanks a lot. does it get added to your overall CGPA right away? asking because i heard that even if u do an internship after 4th sem, the internship credits only get added in the final year.\n│   └── Dont know the exact rules but the summer course i did between 4th and 5th sem got attached to my 5th sem sgpa on my marks card .\n└── So will it be added to my cgpa in the final year along with internship credits?"
