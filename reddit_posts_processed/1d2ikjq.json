PESSAT students and CET first round are together, CET second round is another group and so on. \nIt will be held in F block (aka S and H block or panini block) for first year. After that in BE block\n└── Aren't they held in F block and G block, with chem cycle in F block and physics cycle in G?\n    └── Nope, both cycles together in F block, atleast from 2022 it's like this.\n        └── Interesting. Thanks for the info."
