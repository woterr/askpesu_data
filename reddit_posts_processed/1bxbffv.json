Similar to backlogs, you need to clear the ESA and 100% of your grade is from the ESA.\n2. When the course's ESA is next held. Either next summer or after a year. \n3. Answered in (1)\n4. No guarantee. \n5. No. A backlog is when you attempt and fail a course. A withdrawal is when you refuse to sit for the exam. \n\nI'd however recommend asking someone on the Discord server for more accurate info.\n└── Alright , Thanks a lot ."
