  "content": "I don't know what I'm seeking here and I'm pretty sure empathy is the last thing I'll find here but here it goes, \nI'm struggling very hard to attend college, I've never been regular or consistent with anything my whole life and i might have adhd ( too broke to go to therapy, so I'm not taking any medications or visit a psychiatrist but I have diagnosed by a probono psychologist). I'm behind on everything and i have no idea what's going on college cuz i don't really have any friends, sure i hang out with 3 diff gang but we are not friends outside college and all of them are hella toxic. Last sem I ended up getting backlog for every subject cuz i had very low attendance and this time I'm afraid it's gonna happen again. Like i tried showing up but I got sick and Imma skip extra two days tho I'm okay now. The course is very hard and dropping out is not even an option and I'm clueless and scared asf. I don't know why I can't show up to classes everyday, ik people show up no matter how hard they struggle just for attendance but I can't seem to do that. I'm gonna mess this sem up too and I'm scared for my future. I'm broke so ide have a backup plan or parents business to take over. Idk what I'm doing here, just wanted let it out and vent ig.",

      "body": "Here is my suggestion. Have a goal for each of the following\n1. Health\n2. Career\n3. Wealth\n4. Relationships\n5. Spirituality\n\nFor health goal, do the basics - eat healthy, stay hydrated, some 1/2 to 1 hour of simple walking or any sport you like, take a bath, get a nice hair cut, cut your nails, wear some nice washed and ironed clothes, listening to music, keep your room clean etc..\n\nHealth is most important. If health is there, then other goals will follow. For career goal, set aside sometime to study. During that time do nothing but study. If followed properly and career goal is achieved then, wealth will follow.\n\nTo achieve the health and career goals, family, friends, teachers, professors may help you. This is when the relationship goal comes in. As they uplift you, you need to give them back something (like gratitude, respect and maybe help them back too). To have wholesome relationships, it's important to maintain a balance. An equal give and take is so so so important.\n\nIn the center of all your goals, remember God.  Without the almighty nothing is possible. Sometimes things don't work out, it means God has different plans and definitely there is something else that will workout. Keep faith in the Lord.\n\nI think, if you keep reminding yourself of all your goals right from when you wake up and keep thinking and working towards them constantly, you will definitely achieve whatever you want.\n\nMaking a timetable definitely help.\n\nTake care brother.\nâ””â”€â”€ I really appreciate you taking your time and sharing your thoughts but I've been there, done that. Nothing has worked on me and things aren't just that simple, I'm struggling with literally everything, idk to function or exist? I'm not even sure if most y'all get this but yeah. When you're on high time survival mode, it drains and exhausts you. I'm all wired out. Idk I need therapy and I know it but thanks man. You take care too\n    â””â”€â”€ I was aimlessly doing things myself when I came across a reel on insta which explained the goals. Trust me it works. It will take time but setting your mindset to always think about goals helped me.\n\nAnyhow, I suggest you must reach out to your family and discuss everything with them. Family cares brother. They do the best for you, always. You must definitely reach out to them. You should also reach out to the college counselor and your mentor and seek help, brother. Definitely people will hear you out. Please reach out to them. At times, we all need someone to uplift us, please don't hesitate to reach out."

The pressure of deadlines and low self esteem comes in Between and i give in each time. It's been 5 days since I went to college ( I was sick but I'm okay now yet i didn't show up) I'm prolly gonna use this sick card till next week ( that's how many days I can skip for this semester, i calculated ðŸ¤¡) and then I can't take any leave even if I want to. No matter how pushy my mom is, I can't make myself go. Last semester I had to withdraw every subject, jus cuz I don't have enough attendance to sit for the exams. I have no hope for me.\n                    â””â”€â”€ I wish it to be better for you.\nYeah it's better (kind of) coz I don't want more regrets to add up now, I'm failing my first semester as I din't even know the syllabus, i don't know now what to say to my parents, I'm thinking of a reason. But it's too hard to get up every morning Just for a  damn fucking attendance, and a class in which idk what actual shit Is going on, as it is one the vast and  toughest course here. I'll keep pushing tho as it's the only I have been doing."
