I've always found myself performing better (on most occasions atleast) in heavy but interesting courses compared to lighter but bland ones. \n\nRegardless, if you want an easy/lightweight course, AIWIR is by far the simplest choice. Don't know too much about the rest, but since this is a question repeated every year, search this subreddit or PESU Discord.\n└── Thanks...."
