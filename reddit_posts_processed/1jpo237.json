      "body": "I was in the hostel until 2023 I guess and it was peace. Got my basic 60hz monitor and ps4 from right in front of the hostel gate security and had it for over 2 years. Plus we also had inspection of our rooms and stuff, didn't fall into trouble with the setup even one time. Idk what's the scene now though.\n└── Online gaming on hostel wifi was an L though. Could never find a work around. I think there are ways where you can connect your laptop to VPN on the wifi and then extend that connection to the ps4 through an ethernet but not sure, never messed around that much tbh."
