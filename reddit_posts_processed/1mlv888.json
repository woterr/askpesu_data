  "content": "I am changing my branch in 3rd sem. The counselling is on 14th. We will be 2 weeks behind from other students. I have a few doubts.\n\n1. Do the classes start from scratch?\n\n2. How are the new sections decided?\n\n3. Is the attendance shifted to other branch coz I am attending most of my current classes.",

Everything before that will be considered as if there was no clg itself.\n├── Like where and when we have to ask them for the section do we want?? During counseling itself in auditorium or after that in office or somewhere\n│   └── When they call for counselling there will be a guy on excel and the list of all students highest cpga first will be displayed. In order they will call and ask what u want. The dude there will change the seat numbers live.\n│       └── Oh thanks\n└── If we don't end up taking a seat, we continue with regular attendance stats in our regular classrooms right?\n    └── Yup\n        └── Thanks"
